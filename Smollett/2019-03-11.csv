March 11 (UPI) -- A U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant accused of stockpiling weapons in order to conduct a large-scale terror attack pleaded not guilty Monday to a four-count indictment in Maryland.

Christopher Hasson, 49, faces charges of unlawful possession of two silencers, possession of firearms by a drug addict and possession of a controlled substance, specifically tramadol.

If convicted, Hasson could face a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of the three firearms-related charges and a maximum of one year for the drug charge.

Prosecutors described Hasson, whom police arrested Feb. 15, as a self-proclaimed white supremacist who planned a domestic terror attack to fuel a race war.

Inspired by Norwegian far-right domestic terrorist Anders Breivik who killed 77 people in his native country, Hasson also allegedly created a hit list of Democrats, and left-leaning commentators and journalists.

In an email addressed to ""Dear friends,"" Hassan said ""I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth,"" blaming ""Liberalist/globalist ideology"" for ""destroying traditional peoples esp white.""

The email details possible biological weapons attacks with Spanish flu, botulism and anthrax, which would then be followed by an attack on the food supply, according to the court documents.

This is also around the time the defendant allegedly began to stockpile a cache of weapons and ammunition.

Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two masked men who lobbed racial and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with a chemical, and left him with a noose around his neck.

After several weeks of investigation, Chicago police charged Smollett with making a false report based on statements from two brothers who said he had paid them to stage the attack.

Smollett was indicted by a grand jury of 16 charges of disorderly conduct on Friday. He maintains his innocence of the charges.

Gloria Schmidt told George Stephanopoulos that the $3,500 the Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers were paid for staging the attack was actually for fitness training.

“They were paid for the training … but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” she said.

When pressed about whether there was any evidence to back up their claims, she said they were asked to “do this favor.”

When pushed on what incentive brothers had to stage the attacked, Schmidt said, “If you’re friends, and I’m saying ‘Hey, I’m going to pay you for training, I’m also asking you to do me a favor’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Schmidt claimed the brothers also feel “taken advantage of,” but she wouldn’t directly answer if she thought the attack was a hoax.

“I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime,” Schmidt said.

Smollett on Friday was indicted by a grand jury on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” the actor’s lawyer, Mark Geragos told CNN on Friday. “And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

He continued, calling out the Chicago Police Department.

“He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report,” Geragos said. “Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

Geragos also challenged the idea that Smollett staged an attack because he wanted a higher salary on the prime time soap opera.

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” he said. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

He also accused Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool.

Watch Geragos below:

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Osundairo brothers told them the attack was orchestrated by Smollett and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

The following day, series star Jussie Smollett will be arraigned in Chicago for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself.

The turn of events that left the Hollywood community and “Empire” fans stunned has cast a pall over the midseason premiere and left those at Fox Broadcasting and studio 20th Century Fox Television waiting with bated breath. According to multiple sources, it had been widely expected that “Empire” would be renewed for a sixth season and the show still enjoys support at both the network and studio. That’s not surprising, considering that even in its fifth season it remains one of the highest-rated shows on Fox. Season to date, “Empire” is averaging a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 in the Nielsen Live+7 numbers, making it the number two scripted show on the network behind only “9-1-1.”

But much hinges on the outcome of Smollett’s current legal predicament. “Empire’s” executive producers announced shortly after Smollett was arrested that his character would be written out of the final two episodes of Season 5. They said this was done so that the show, which is currently in its final week of production on the season, could “avoid further disruption on set.” Many options are on the table regarding Smollett and his character, Jamal Lyon. Sources tell Vt is possible the character could be killed off or the role could be recast.

It also appears that Smollett’s role in the remainder of the season is being downplayed, despite Jamal’s engagement being a major storyline in the first half of Season 5. Except for a midseason recap video released in the beginning of March, none of the promotional clips for the second half of Season 5 released since Smollett’s arrest have prominently featured him, rather offering just fleeting glimpses of Jamal. One Fox insider downplayed this, however, saying that it is common for such clips to focus more heavily on series stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard.

Smollett has been indicted on 16 counts of filing a false police report. The actor and musician claimed that he was the victim of an assault in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago, stating two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, poured bleach on him, and placed a rope around his neck. Smollett also said that the two men used the phrase “MAGA country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” slogan.

However, investigators now believe Smollett paid two acquaintances — brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — to help him stage the attack. Police previously arrested the brothers, but they were later released without being charged. They are now cooperating with the investigation.

During a press conference the Chicago PD stated they believed Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on “Empire.” They also said they believe Smollett had sent a threatening letter to himself that was received at “Empire’s” Chicago production office days before the attack. Smollett and his representatives have repeatedly denied the allegations."

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season."

The Jussie Smollett saga takes yet another turn today as a key detail in the Chicago Police Department’s case is proven untrue.

According to TMZ, the Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, have now confirmed that the $3,500 check that Jussie wrote to them was indeed for “training and nutrition”.

During their self-aggrandizing press conference, Superintendent Eddie Johnson made a big deal of the “fact” that Jussie wrote the check specifically for the staged hate crime. The bros appear to be siding with Jussie on this particular aspect and that leaves a lot of room to speculate about what else CPD has fudged in their 16 count indictment against the Empire actor.

So, did the cops blatantly lie? Are the bros now covering for Jussie? Why did they take so long to address this? WHAT THE HELL IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING HERE?!?!

12 March 2019

But his lawyer Mark Geragos has slammed the ruling as “prosecutorial overkill”, and insists his client is “adamantly” maintaining his innocence ahead of the case going to trial.



In a statement to People magazine, he said: “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.



“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”



Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.



Jussie had told police he was assaulted at 2am by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white.



The indictment read: ""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed.""

She is representing Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and his brother Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo.

“This case really is about … a person who is in a position of trust who really betrayed my clients and who took advantage of them,” Schmidt told Fox News on Monday.

“Your clients anticipated money in the form of $3500 in a written check?” Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked.

“What they did — and I’ll say they have tremendous regret over their role and their participation in this — What they did was accept payment for training that also encompassed doing a favor for this person,” the lawyer said. “So it is not — it’s not an easy narrative to say, ‘Oh, okay, let’s take $3500 for this.'”

Hemmer pressed her, saying, “Your clients produced the receipt for the rope made into a noose, is that correct? They aren’t entirely innocent here.”

“When you say ‘innocent,’ I’m saying that they are remorseful for their involvement. That’s without a doubt,” Schmidt insisted. “I was there to witness their realization process, to see that this was something that was going to affect tremendous people across the board, have an enormous impact on minority populations. So I was there to see that realization process and they are remorseful for that.”

Fox News reporter Sandra Smith asked the lawyer why the Osundairo brothers agreed to stage the hate hoax attack on Smollett.

“When we go back to the original hours that followed the report of this attack, Smollett said his attackers — the two brothers — poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck and it was then the investigation launched,” Smith said. “That turned into hours, days, tens of thousands of dollars. I hear you saying that they have regret over this incident. Why did they do it?”

The lawyer said she could not answer that question, but the Osundairo brothers themselves should do so.

“You know, that’s a great question. I think that everyone wants to know why they did it,” Schmidt acknowledged. “I think I’m not the best person to answer that so I really think that you will hear the best from them directly.”

Smollett claimed that on January 29, masked white attackers wearing MAGA hats screamed, “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-scented liquid on him.

Last month, Chicago Police announced that they believed the Osundairo brothers attacked Smollett on his orders and that they considered Smollett a suspect. On Friday, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts for lying to police about this matter. Dozens of hospital employees were fired for reviewing Smollett’s medical records.

No matter how remorseful the Osundairo brothers are, they took part in this horrendous hate hoax that tied up police resources, branded Chicago as a hateful city, and cast aspersions on supporters of President Donald Trump.

Yet Schmidt insisted that “they’re not in any legal peril.” The Osundairo brothers cooperated with police, uncovering the falsehood of the hoax. This may give them immunity for their role in the deception. Indeed, the remorse the lawyer cited might help explain why the Osundairo brothers turned on Smollett.

Kelly and his singing career any further.

On Saturday, during the a luncheon for the nominees of the 50th NAACP Image Awards, President and CEO Derrick Johnson took time to thrash the singer after his scathing CBS This Morning interview with Gayle King went off the rails. In it, Kelly is seen crying amid defending himself against sexual abuse claims, Variety reports.

“We cannot celebrate inclusion as long as we look at the foolishness on television, whether it’s R. Kelly or other unfortunate incidents,” Johnson repordly said at the luncheon. “We must continue to uphold and uplift all of our creativity because it’s through our creative power that we will continue to lead the nation.”

Kelly has become the butt of many jokes these days since the clip of his temper tantrum went viral.

Saturday Night Live, did a hilarious take on the King/Kelly interview with comedians Leslie Jones and Kennan Thompson posing as the much-talked about duo.

Kelly then ended up in the opening jokes during the nominees’ luncheon which was hosted by actress/producer Sheryl Lee Ralph and pop-soul singer, Major.

“I thought Jesus was recovering after that Gayle King interview,” Ralph said which got Major going into pretending to be Kelly during his interview melt-down: “‘I didn’t do it!’ Major shouted. “While the cameras were on, ‘I didn’t do it!’”

The conversation surrounding Kelly opened up discussions of how despite the musician’s grandstanding, positive images of Black folks have recently been at the forefront thanks to movie like Black Panther, which helped to push the envelope of how Hollywood has become more receptive of minority movies.

“Black people are making noise right now,” said This Is Us star and NAACP Image nominee Lyric Ross. “Especially young people — they’re speaking out and telling you what you need to hear, and that’s what we need right now.”

“This year’s Oscars felt pretty cool — we had ‘Black Panther’ up there; ‘Green Book’ won,” said Black-ish star and NAACP Image nominee Marcus Scribner. “Black talent has been making a lot of amazing movies and television shows for a really long time, and it’s cool to see us finally getting recognized on the grand stage.”

There was no mention though of Jussie Smollett’s latest situation after he was indicted on 16 counts for allegedly paying two people to help him orchestrate a hate crime.

Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — The two brothers who police said helped stage an attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago six weeks ago were “taken advantage of” and are now trying to “piece their lives together,” their lawyer tells ABC News.

“What I can tell you right now is the tremendous regret that they have over their involvement in this situation,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview Monday with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on “Good Morning America.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical was poured on him. The alleged assailants, police were told, yelled “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. Those men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested Feb. 13, but police didn’t charge them and said at the time neither remained a suspect.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series “Empire” is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

The memo line on the $3,500 check read that it was for personal training, sources said.

The brothers’ attorney said the check from Smollett was payment for both the personal training and their help in staging the attack.

“They were training together and so they were paid for that, but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” Schmidt said in the “GMA” interview Monday morning.

Schmidt said her clients “trusted” Smollett to have their best interests at heart, but the actor “really just took advantage of them.”

“They worked with Jessie, they’ve known him, they were friends with him. This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously Mr. Smollett has connections,” she added. “This later turned out to be a big betrayal.”

When asked whether her clients have evidence to back up their claims, Schmidt responded, “Of course.”

On Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged crime, turned himself in to police the next morning.

“Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, visibly angry, said at a Feb. 21 press conference. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who pleaded not guilty, was released after posting 10 percent of his bail.

Last week, the Osundairo brothers testified before a grand jury, which ultimately returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett for disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office. Schmidt said her clients “were not looking for anything” in return.

“They are working very hard right now to piece their lives together. I mean, this was life-altering,” she said in the “GMA” interview Monday morning. “They know that this has impacted a lot of minority populations, so they are working very hard to move this in a positive direction.”

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

Patrick O'Shaughnessy, DO, may no longer practice emergency medicine, but he has taken the lessons from his time in the field to the C-suite to improve the quality of care for the thousands of patients his system serves.

Dr. O'Shaughnessy is executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Rockville Centre N.Y.-based Catholic Health Services. He previously served as senior vice president and CMO of the system. Prior to joining CHS, he was chairman of the department of emergency medicine of St. Catherine of Siena Medical Center in Smithtown, N.Y., before becoming CMO of the hospital.

Dr. O'Shaughnessy earned his doctorate of osteopathic medicine from the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old Westbury, his master's in business administration and healthcare administration from Garden City, N.Y.-based Adelphi University, and a master's of population health and population health management from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. He recently spoke with Becker's and answered our seven ""Corner Office"" questions.

Editor's note: Responses have been edited lightly for length and style.

Question: What's the one thing that really piqued your interest in healthcare?

Dr. Patrick O’Shaughnessy: It's hard to decide on one thing, but I think all of us in the healthcare space — whether we're clinicians or administrators — got into healthcare to make a difference and ultimately help ease pain and suffering, help improve quality of life and longevity, and support the overall human condition. I think at heart, we're all humanists, so we believe in really trying to make our workspace better to improve the health and lives of those we care for.

Q: What do you enjoy most about Long Island?

PO: So I live pretty much right in the middle of Long Island in a town called Dix Hills, New York. CHS has a footprint that extends along Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the North Shore and the South Shore. Along with a nice blend of thought leaders at the system, we have a mix of academic and community infrastructure, and a very astute population. Our patient population has challenges, so I think one of the things I enjoy most about Long Island is the opportunity we have as part of CHS to strengthen the communities we serve by providing the very best of care across all populations. We have some of the wealthiest communities in the country, and we have a mix of communities that are struggling. It really brings everything together in one small environment.

I personally love the diversity of environments in Long Island. I think we've got some really great beaches and we're close to New York City, which is great. We're only about 45 minutes out of Manhattan so it's easy to get into the city, but Long Island also has a lot of unique geography to explore. I'm also a pilot. It's just beautiful flying over the beaches, over the East End, up through the North Fork, up into Massachusetts and Martha's Vineyard. It's just a beautiful area.

Q: If you could eliminate one of the healthcare industry's problems overnight, which would it be?

PO: There are so many, but I think my choice would be eliminating silos. There are administrative silos in how we process care, there are silos in policy between the state and federal level and then there are silos of clinical care. There's an incredible amount of waste. I think really creating an enhanced, unified approach both from a policy perspective and a payer perspective is what I would do. How do we eliminate some of the burden for patients and providers?

Q: What is your greatest talent outside of the C suite?

PO: We do a lot of mission-based work at CHS because we're a faith-based organization. I am a person of faith and a family person. When I'm not working, I'm with my family. I'm incredibly lucky to be a dad and have a wonderful family. My daughter is one of my proudest accomplishments, so spending time with her and seeing her mature into an incredible human is probably the most gratifying thing I do outside of work.

I actually started college in aviation school and was taking the military route before I changed my mind. However, a lot of what I learned there in terms of training around safety mechanisms, effective communication, and checklists, I brought to CHS as part of our safety work. I also speak nationally on this topic relating to healthcare safety and quality. Even though those lessons came from outside the C-suite, I apply them to the C-suite and I apply them to healthcare delivery.

Q: How do you revitalize yourself?

PO: I'm an avid fitness enthusiast. I believe in taking time outside of work to take care of your body. I believe if you take care of your body, it'll take care of you, so I work out quite a bit. I also fly, and there's nothing more gratifying than watching the sunset over Montauk Point or flying the Hudson and going up to West Point. Those are things I do to kind of recharge and revitalize.

Q: What's one piece of advice you remember most clearly?

PO: There are so many. Something that has been very influential in my career is the fact that I'm a survivor of the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. I gained a sense of commitment to teamwork and working together from that — the idea that when working collectively together as a team, you could really take any horrible situation and try to make the best possible outcome out of it.

Then as an emergency physician, part of our training is really about analyzing problems effectively but acting and executing. I've taken that to my administrative work; I've taken that to my life. In fact, I worked on a phrase and trademarked it, called ""Triage your Life."" If you think about it, you have to prioritize problems, you have to analyze them, but you have to be able to execute. I think a lot of people get caught up in over-analysis and failure to act and it's just part of your training. As a young physician, there were so many influential people in my career that that's how you were trained. I think that's why I can't tell you how many times I now run across emergency physicians who are in administrative roles, such as myself, or even running healthcare systems because of those attributes.

Q: What do you consider your greatest accomplishment at CHS so far?

PO: It's our reduction in preventable harm and the high reliability journey, which I have the privilege to lead. We've taken the concept of high reliability science and, looking at how humans make errors, we trained our over 18,000 employees and 5,000 medical staff and affiliated clinical team members on these error prevention training techniques.

We've eliminated vertical power distance between our personnel and created an enhanced culture of safety where people understand why errors occur. They look for them, they track them and they mitigate them before they reach the patient. We've had significant reductions in related harm events and hospital associated events that have saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. That's what gets me up every morning, that's why I come to work. Even though I'm not at the bedside anymore, someone told me when I moved into administrative work, ""Patrick, if you're in a busy ED during a 12-hour shift, you impact the lives of maybe 30 people that come in to see you. In this position, you can literally impact thousands of lives."" I feel like I'm doing that, and that's what keeps me coming back every day.

We all know that Carlson works for Fox, and therefore nothing will happen to him except a few days of embarrassment. For a lot of people, that's enough -- but after all these years, I'm sick of the double standard. This would be career-ending for a commentator employed anywhere outside the right-wing bubble. A non-conservative news organization that didn't fire someone who'd said these things would be subject to days of harassment from Fox News -- dozens and dozens of segments over a period of a few days. The president and Republican members of Congress would weigh in. It would become the #1 news story in America.

Nothing like this will happen in Carlson's case. He won't be Jussie Smollett or Ilhan Omar. Fox will have his back, and it will blow over any minute now. So I can't enjoy the pile-on while it lasts. I know how it ends.

I'm also dismayed by a story that appeared on the front-page of The Washington Post yesterday. It's an awestruck response to President Trump's CPAC speech the previous weekend, which really was no big deal -- it was just like all his other pep-rally speeches, except longer. But the Post's Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker used it to demonstrate two premises: that Trump is larger than life, and that -- although the authors would never admit that this is their point -- Trump is the real centrist in American politics.

The awe is palpable. Yes, according to Parker and Rucker, Trump is dishonest and a loose cannon -- but he's large and contains multitudes. (The headline is ""The 10 Personas of Donald Trump in a Single Speech."" The personas are: the Entertainer, the Fighter, the Victim, the Bully, the Expert, the Auditor, the Braggart, the Fabulist, the Rebel, and the Pundit.)

He lambasted and lampooned his rivals. He exaggerated and ballyhooed his record. He riddled his remarks with contradictions, shoddy statistics and falsehoods. And he embroidered it all with a fake Southern accent, curse words and bouts of extravagant pantomime. For two hours and five minutes last weekend, President Trump dazzled his supporters and appalled his critics with a mind-spinning, free-associating performance that neatly encapsulated his singular standing as a polarizing cultural figure.

Note the awe: the speech was ""a mind-spinning, free-associating performance that neatly encapsulated his singular standing as a polarizing cultural figure.""

And note the binary: Trump ""dazzled his supporters and appalled critics."" This is how Trump, of all people, morphs in the media's telling into the real centrist in the presidential race. His critics hate him! His fans love him! He must be somewhere in the middle!

More:

The spectacle showcased Trump in his purest form, an unconventional politician who drives opponents to madness and acolytes to glee.

There it is again -- Trump as the man in the middle.

The businessman-turned-reality-TV-star-turned-politician inhabited multiple personas in the space of a single speech — often intertwined and at a dizzying clip — from entertainer to fighter, from fabulist to bully.

He's just ... larger than life, as Parker and Rucker describe him. Who on the other side is as compellingly outsize a figure as this?

He's unfazed by failure, the ultimate happy warrior:

Trump took the CPAC stage after a stretch of global failures: the collapse of nuclear talks with North Korea; record high trade deficits and signs of a slowing economy; a surge in illegal immigration; and an unbuilt border wall that is unfunded after a lost standoff with Democrats in Congress. Yet Trump on this Saturday afternoon was positively buoyant.

He's a force of nature who cannot be contained:

His aides and confidants liken him to a whistling teapot, a pressure cooker that might explode if he does not blow off steam. For Trump, the platform was a release valve.

Here's another binary:

A commentary in the libertarian publication Reason described Trump’s turn on the CPAC stage as “Prince-at-the-Super-Bowl great,” declaring that, if he can consistently re-create the dynamic, “his reelection is a foregone conclusion.” The left-leaning Salon website, meanwhile, described his remarks as “more like the delusional ramblings of someone hopped up on drugs or suffering a mental breakdown than anything resembling a normal political speech.”

He's more powerful than the Post's own fact-checking apparatus, because he is loved:

Little of what Trump said was factual — he made 102 false or misleading claims in the speech, according to an analysis by The Washington Post’s Fact Checker — yet to this crowd and millions of supporters around the country, his broader points rang true and carried the imprimatur of authority because he delivered them.

How great was Trump? He used ... hand movement!

He relied on his trademark gestures, from extending his index fingers and thumbs to frame his declarations of success to splaying his hands apart as if pulling taffy.

Ultimately:

It was the presidency as Vaudeville act — the commander in chief at Carnegie Hall.

Which is it? A grind-it-out performance in a sad little tank town, or the pinnacle of a showman's success, a night on the most presitgious stage imaginable? It's both, I guess -- Trump is a scrappy, hungry road dog and he also hit the big time.

I don't care how many lies the rest of the story enumerates. I don't care that the part of the story that describes Trump as victim makes him seem like, well, a whiny guy playing the victim card. Trump is portrayed here as a giant his critics can't kill. Parker and Rucker may be appalled, but they're also impressed.

This is what the eventual Democratic presidential nominee will have to run against: not just Trump, but the myth of Trump. It won't be easy, with the mainstream media printing the legend.

“I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime,” she said when asked by Stephanolopolous to confirm that the attack was a hoax, which is how Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the Jan. 29 incident in which Smollett claimed that two men set upon him on a Chicago street and shouted racist and homophobic slurs while striking him, putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach on his body.

Schmidt maintained that there is evidence to back up the brothers’ claims that Smollett masterminded the alleged attack and claimed the Empire star “took advantage of” the men by involving them in the plot. She was also quick to clarify that her clients were indeed paid by Smollett for their personal training services, as evidenced by an image of a $3,500 check circulating in the media.

On Friday (March 8), Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts by a Chicago grand jury for allegedly falsifying a police report and lying to authorities about the supposed hate crime.

Unfortunately, though, many people may have drawn the wrong lessons from these examples.

On Thursday, Paul Manafort, a white man, got a 47-month sentence for massive tax and bank fraud, far less than the 24 years recommended by prosecutors. People were outraged, rightfully pointing out that every day in America, Black people face harsher sentences for less serious offenses. Many even called for Manafort to receive more prison time as a way to address this inequity.

One day later, another high profile case hit the news, just in time to pour salt on the Manafort-sentencing wound. Jussie Smollett, a Black man, got indicted on 16 felonies for lying to the police, meaning that he could face up to 64 years in prison if convicted.

So here in plain sight was the double standard so many of us decry. A rich white man gets leniency, while a Black man, an actor notwithstanding, gets the book thrown at him.

The outrage over these two systems of justice is entirely justified. There is systemic racism in our nation’s criminal legal system, where Black people are incarcerated at six times and Latinos at threes time the rate of non-Latino whites. One in three young Black men can expect to serve time in prison if current trends continue. To put this in context, the United States imprisons a larger percentage of its Black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.

These disparities are not explained by offenses committed, but are a product of the extraordinary discretion afforded to the police, prosecutors, and judges. Manafort receiving a lenient sentence while Smollett faces harsh treatment exemplifies the discretion afforded to law enforcement and the judicial system. In one, a judge exercised discretion to show leniency, while in the other, a prosecutor exercised discretion to seek harsh punishment.

But the solution to this inequity is not harsher sentences for people like Paul Manafort. If we want to end our nation’s addiction to mass incarceration, then we must wean ourselves off long prison sentences as a default solution to punishing crime. To end mass incarceration, in other words, the criminal legal system should start treating everyone the way it currently treats rich white men.

Sentences should go down, and prosecutors should stop overcharging. We must end the status quo, which assumes that incarceration is the solution to lying to the police or that a four-year prison sentence for fraud is somehow light punishment.

In response to the Manafort sentencing, presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar tweeted, “Crimes committed in an office building should be treated as seriously as crimes committed on a street corner.”

She is right that both should be treated the same, but if she meant that the solution is longer sentences for people like Manafort, then she is wrong. The solution is to lower sentences, and to treat all people, including people arrested on the “street corner,” with less prison and more alternatives to incarceration."

Apparently, without any sense of irony, lawyers for indicted Empire star Jussie Smollett have claimed that the press has victimized the actor in a “gang bang.”

Last week, a grand jury slapped Smollet with a staggering 16 felony charges after he allegedly faked a hate crime attack.

Prosecutors claim Smollett paid two accomplices to douse him in bleach, tie a rope around his neck, and beat him as a publicity stunt designed to nab Smollet a pay raise on his show.

Smollett continues to maintain his innocence.

Now, Mark Geragos, the noted showboat attorney whose clients have included Winona Ryder and Michael Jackson, says the press has gang banged Smollett in the name of profits.

“What is happening here is, frankly, a media gang bang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” Geragos told Anderson Cooper.

“I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Geragos went on to criticize the Chicago police for continuing leaks to the media regarding the case.

He also slammed the grand jury for not indicting Smollett’s alleged accomplices, brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, and described the mounting evidence against Smollett as circumstantial.

The producers of Empire have already deleted Smollett’s scenes from the remainder of the season, and rumors abound that his role will be recast. Should a jury convict him, the actor will also face lengthy jail time for his crime.

The Chicago Police Department has accused Smollett of staging a hate crime against himself to bolster his career, which he continues to deny. Many people accepted the department's case against Smollett, as it seemed strong at first. According to a new report by Good Morning America, however, two key figures are now disputing one of the biggest pieces of evidence.

The police claimed that Smollett wrote a $3,500 check to Ola and Abel Osundairo as payment for the staged attack against him in January. However, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, spoke on their behalf on Monday, explaining that the check really was payment for training. The Empire star reportedly admired the brothers' dedication to fitness, and paid top dollar for a personal training and a nutrition program to help him reach their level.

""They were paid for the training,"" Schmidt said on ABC's Good Morning America. ""I mean, they were training together, so they were paid for that. But they were also asked to do this favor for him. Unbeknownst to them, because obviously this later turned out to be a big betrayal of them.""

When asked to specify whether the money was intended for the staged fight or the training, Schimdt admitted that it was a strange thing to define. However, ultimately she says the brothers saw the money as payment for the training, and the attack as a ""favor,"" completely separate.

""It would be such an easy narrative to just say it that way, but it's unfortunately a very complicated relationship for them. If you're friends, and I say 'hey, I'm going to pay you for training,' and I'm also asking you to do me a favor... And the favor was to stage the attack.""

This new interview comes in direct contrast with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's earlier statements. In a news conference, Johnson attributed Smollett's payment directly to the attack.

""Smollet paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process,"" he said, according to TMZ.

Separating the money from the attack may hurt the department's case, and could take away one of their key pieces of evidence. Experts expect Smollett's lawyer, Mark Geragos, to raise this question with Johnson if the case does go to trial."

A lawyer representing two brothers who became embroiled in the apparent fake hate crime against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is pointing the finger, and she’s pointing it at Smollett.

The actor, meanwhile, is maintaining his innocence after an Illinois grand jury on Friday indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in connection with the incident.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt, who represents brothers Abindola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, said today that her clients were taken advantage of by a trusted friend, meaning Smollett. Schmidt discussed the case during an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“My clients were just taken advantage of by someone they trusted,” Schmidt said. “This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. … Someone they had trusted to consider their best interest.”

The Chicago Sun-Times reports: “Schmidt said the $3,500 check they were paid, which was marked as a payment for a personal training program, was also intended, in a nuanced way, for the staged attack.”

The paper quotes Schmidt saying: “They were paid for the training . . . but they were also asked to do this favor for him.”

Schmidt also said of the brothers: “They’re working very hard right now to piece their lives together. … They know that this has impacted a lot of minority populations, so they’re working very hard to just move this in a positive direction.”

Meanwhile, attorney Mark Geragos, who’s representing Smollett, continues to maintain Smollett’s innocence. On Friday Geragos expressed outrage at the 16-count indictment.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, told Good Morning America Monday that the brothers have ""tremendous regret...over their involvement in the situation.""

""I think once Mark Geragos [Smollett's attorney] and everyone starts looking into this situation, they're going to see really that my clients were just taken advantage of by someone that they trusted,"" she said.

When asked if the brothers had evidence to back their explosive claims that changed the trajectory of the case, Schmidt said ""of course.""

""And that's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.

In a later interview with Access Hollywood, Schmidt said her clients cooperated with Chicago police immediately and presented evidence that was investigated. That same day, the duo walked out of the police department.

A Cook County grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts Friday in connection with his reporting of the alleged attack he claimed to have suffered in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood in late January.

Police alleged Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary.

Schmidt said the brothers thought they were helping a friend who would in turn help their careers.

""The issue here is that they were in a position with a friend who said, 'Let's basically pay you for training and then do a favor for me,'"" she said.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in filing a false report, court documents show. All 16 counts are Class 4 felonies, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of one-to-three years in prison. Probation is also possible.

The indictment issued by the grand jury Friday lays out two separate sets of charges against the actor. The first set alleges that Smollett lied to responding officers immediately following the reported attack.

Specifically, the charges allege that Smollett made false statements about the nature of the attack, telling officers that the attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him, according to the indictment.

The second set of charges alleges that Smollett made false statements to detectives in a follow-up interview about the case.

""Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful and if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor and respected him as a role model,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. ""We stand behind the work of our detectives.""

Smollett's attorneys told NBC News that they have yet to review the documents, but that they will ""push back against"" the charges filed against their client.

Geragos, an attorney for Smollett, later released a statement saying the indictment was ""not unexpected.""

""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said. ""This redundant andvindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" he said.

20th Century Fox Television declined to comment on the new charges against the actor.

Smollett was previously charged in February with one felony count of disorderly conduct in filing a false police report.

Chicago police said in a press conference announcing the initial charge that Smollett sent a ""false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself and staged a hate crime attack in Chicago because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

Authorities had previously said new information ""shifted"" their investigation of the reported assault, in which Smollett told authorities he was physically attacked as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant on Jan. 29. He said two masked men shouted racial, anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" as they looped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him before running away.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's legal team said in a statement when he was initially charged. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Schmidt said she's ""confident"" the brothers ""did not do a hate crime.""

Smollett is due back in court on March 14."

My clients had an agreement to provide personal training services to Mr. Smollett. To say the check was also intended for a favor beyond the training is an accurate statement.""

Jussie Smollett wrote that $3,500 check to the Osundairo brothers to pay for a training program -- something the brothers themselves now confirm, which essentially negates one of the strongest statements Chicago PD made about the case.

Ola and Abel Osundairo's attorney, Gloria Schmidt, spoke out on their behalf Monday on 'GMA,' confirming what TMZ first reported ... that the check was compensation for a training and nutrition program designed to get Jussie in shape for a music video shoot.

You'll recall ... during police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's news conference he said, point blank, ""Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process.""

So, you gotta wonder ... if the police got that detail wrong, what else did they get wrong? You can bet Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, will raise that issue.

Remember, this also comes on the heels of a grand jury handing up a 16-count indictment against Jussie -- where it appears they nailed the actor for EACH allegedly false statement he made during 2 police interviews. The grand jury arrived at that remarkable number -- SIXTEEN -- by following the lead of prosecutors who presented the case."

Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office on Feb. 20. The grand jury applied another 15 counts in its 36-page indictment.

Smullet is now facing a maximum sentence of 48 years in prison up to $400,000 in fines.

He is expected to cut a plea deal with authorities, according to ABC News.

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one for each lie Smollett allegedly told to two groups of police officers. The first regards to Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by men who made racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges relate to Smollett’s interview with police when he claimed the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.

These are his attackers:

Two large black Nigerian men, whom he paid $3500 to stage the attack.

Smollet’s attorney said in response:

The fact of an indictment is not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.

No one robbed Smollet of anything.

It was Smollet who robbed the police of their time, and of taxpayers footing the bill for them to investigate a fake hate crime.

In essence, Smollet intentionally faked a crime targeted at white men. This is a crime, and a warning to other hoax creators– try this and you’ll end up in jail."

Really? After Charlottesville, Ferguson, Baltimore’s riots, Ralph Northam, Jussie Smollett, Roseanne Barr, Kanye West’s various rants, Philando Castile, #BlackLivesMatter, the Dallas police shootings, the Charleston church shooting, the removal of the Confederate flag from South Carolina state-capitol grounds, Laquan McDonald, Eric Garner, Rachel Dolezal, former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and arguments about subconscious bias and Starbucks’ #RaceTogether campaign and microaggressions, the regular controversies about associations with Louis Farrakhan, the arguments about Harvard’s admissions standards and Asian-Americans . . . in Harris’ eyes, this country still hasn’t had an honest discussion about race?

(Recently in Maryland, a white Democratic state legislator referred to a particular district as an N-word district. Her colleagues censured her, and like Northam, she resisted calls to resign . . . and life is going on, with local supporters insisting “That’s just not who she is.” If she were of the other party, would her fellow Democrats react the same way? Would “certain whites get a pass for racially insensitive comments, actions, or views because of their partisan affiliation” be part of this national honest discussion?)

We didn’t have an honest discussion about race in this country during the Obama presidency? The nutty birther allegations, Jeremiah Wright, Henry Louis Gates’s arrest, “the police acted stupidly,” the statement that Latinos need to “punish their enemies,”, the ubiquitous presence of Al Sharpton, the emergence of #BlackLivesMatter . . . none of those moments meet Harris’s definition of “an honest conversation about race”? (The comment is reminiscent of former attorney general Eric Holder’s declaration, one month after Obama’s inauguration, that Americans were “in things racial, we have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways, a nation of cowards.” The country didn’t have an honest discussion about race after Green Book, BlacKkKlansman, GetOut, Selma, Hidden Figures, The Help, Crash, The Butler, 12 Years a Slave, 42? Not after #OscarsSoWhite?"

""They did not know their loyalty to him would be betrayed,"" Schmidt said, speaking of the brothers' relationship with Smollett. ""They find themselves in a situation where they are tremendously regretful.""

Schmidt confirmed the brothers have not sought any plea deal and have cooperated with the grand jury examining the case. She also confirmed that they are not facing any charges. Smollett was indicted last week on 16 felony counts; he maintains his innocence.

""This entire thing started because they put their trust in the wrong person,"" Schmidt said in the interview. ""You have someone here who is a celebrity type, someone who is in a position of trust, someone who works with these people, someone who is able to help their careers if he so wants to, and then he betrays them.""

Smollett claimed that on January 29 he was attacked by two masked men in Chicago who yelled racial and homophobic slurs and tied a looped rope, shaped like a noose, around his neck. He claims he heard them shout, ""this is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, before the assailants poured a chemical substance on him and ran away.

The Osundairo brothers were initially regarded by police as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation. They left for Nigeria on the same day as the attack, though they they were detained by police at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport upon their return on February 13.

After conducting an investigation, Chicago police concluded Smollett staged the attack and paid the two brothers to participate, noting that they discovered a $3,500 check Smollett used to pay the Osundairo brothers.

Smollett is now facing 16 charges including disorderly conduct and making a false report of an attack to police.

Smollett, 36, gained fame in recent years for his role as Jamal Lyon on FOX's hit television show ""Empire."" Executive producers for ""Empire"" announced last month they are writing Smollett's character out of the show's final two seasons, stating they want ""to avoid further disruption on set.""

In February, two weeks after the alleged attack, Schmidt said the brothers were ""baffled about why they are people of interest,"" adding, ""It's an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it's not my guys.""

During her interview with CBSN, Schmidt confirmed that prior to the incident, the Osundairo brothers had a friendship with Smollett and that they trained at the gym with him. But, when asked directly, she would not confirm that Smollett asked her clients to stage the attack or if they agreed to do it. Instead Schmidt praised her clients' cooperation with Chicago police.

""At the end of the day it was thanks to that cooperation the trajectory of their investigation switched,"" she said. ""Remember, my clients were persons of interest at the start, then they became suspects, they were arrested, and then they went home. And obviously that shift is because of that evidence that came to light and it was because this is something that was at Mr. Smollett's direction.""

During her interview, Schmidt also cleared up one point that has been incorrectly stated by some media outlets: that the brothers are Nigerian.

""They are Americans,"" she said. ""They were born and raised in Chicago. They were born here and raised here."""

The Nigerian brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett alleged staged attack continue to speak out.

Abel and Ola Osundairo, both of whom the Empire star allegedly paid to stage a “bogus” attack against him, first issued a public apology through their attorney over a week ago, but now have more evidence to back up their side of the story.

On Monday, the Osundairo brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt sat down with Good Morning America and provided some insight on how her clients got mixed up in Jussie’s alleged elaborate scheme.

It’s been said the duo worked with Smollett as extras on FOX‘s Empire and trained at the same gym together. However, Schmidt says that their collective friendship wasn’t genuine, and described the 36-year-old star as “someone who was in a position of trust with my clients, who really just took advantage of them.”

She explains:

“They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him. This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.”

The attorney reiterated that Abel and Ola were paid for personal training by Smollett until he asked them for a favor.

“It’s unfortunately a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I’m saying, ‘Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor,’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Talk about a bait and switch!

Perezcious readers, if you ever needed a serious reminder about being careful who you do favor for, this is one for ya.

It’s still unclear at this point if the brothers will face any charges, but it’s unlikely as they’ve expressed remorse and have cooperated with police from jump street.

As we wrote, on Friday, the Cook County grand jury indicted Jussie on 16 counts for “false report of offens”” — all class 4 felonies. If found guilty, the actor could face years in prison.

At the time, his attorney Mark Geragos released a statement saying, “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Let’s not forget, Hollywood has also robbed him of that presumption too, with reports that all of the thespian’s career prospects have dried up…

All things considered, we’re not surprised. And it’s really hard to feel bad for the guy — especially if he made all of this up and dragged two innocent people into the process.

What do YOU guys think?

Are you tired of hearing about the whole thing? Or patiently waiting for the whole truth and for “justice” to be served to Jussie?

ABC was the only network Monday morning to update viewers on the media-hyped case.

While giving the story attention in their Friday evening newscasts, CBS and NBC didn’t update viewers on their morning news programs Monday, which was arguably necessary given how much time the networks spent breathlessly promoting Smollett’s hoax in weeks prior.

However, ABC’s Eva Pilgrim devoted an entire report to the story on Monday’s Good Morning America. She noted Smollett had been indicted by a Chicago grand jury for allegations that he “repeatedly lied to police about being the victim of a homophobic and racist attack,” and played clips of Smollett’s lawyer defending his client as innocent. Pilgrim ended her report noting, “The penalty for the newest set of charges against Smollett ranges from probation to up to three years in prison and/or a twenty-five thousand dollar fine. He's not yet entered a plea on these new charges. He's due back in court next Thursday on that original charge.”

After her report, anchor George Stephanopoulos sat down with the lawyer representing the two brothers who Smollett hired to stage the attack. Stephanopoulos showed the attorney more credulity than Robin Roberts showed Smollett during her interview, asking:

What do the brothers have to back up their story? ... But do they have evidence to back up their claims? ... How did this all happen? How did they get caught up in this in the first place?

Perhaps ABC is only reporting on this to save face for the backlash they received over that Roberts’ interview, however at least they did something, unlike the other two networks who just wanted to move on from the story that didn’t turn out like they hoped."

Jail for Jussie?

Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse for Jussie Smollett, they did — 16 times worse. On Friday, the grand jury charged the actor with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly making false reports, though Smollett continues to maintain his innocence.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” his lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in a statement to People. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.” To put it mildly.

Geragos added: “This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

That’s not to say that what Smollett did wasn’t stupid or thoughtless. But jail? People have done way more egregious things and been charged with and sentenced to less.

Smollett is scheduled to be arraigned on March 14. In the meantime, the Chicago Police Department has opened an internal investigation into the alleged leaks that came from officers and officials during the early stages of the case. Not sure how that will play out for Jussie. Guess they — and we — will wait.

“They are incredible together,” a source told People. “Very much soulmates that bring out the best in each other and are so supportive of each other. From the start, they moved very quickly. Their relationship was always very passionate. Jennifer quickly fell very hard for Alex. And she quickly started planning for their future.”

According to the mag, the couple are on vacation and are enjoying a few days to themselves before heading back to work. Good call. Congrats to them.

As of now, there has been no wedding planning, but their children will “definitely” play a big part in it. And if Jennifer needs a maid of honour, Ellen DeGeneres has thrown her hat into the ring. You’re welcome, J-Rod.

Pete Davidson addressed his relationship with Kate Beckinsale for the first time

This whole season, Pete Davidson has been known to clear the air about his personal life on Saturday Night Live and this past weekend was no different. The comedian appeared on “Weekend Update” where he addressed his relationship with Kate Beckinsale. Colin Jost called her his girlfriend, Pete didn’t deny it and went on to say that people are most intrigued by their 20-year age difference.

According to E!, Davidson said it doesn’t bother him nor Kate, but for those who do have questions, they can easily get answers from a plethora of older celebrity dudes who are dating or married to younger women and not getting that same double standard, from “Leonardo DiCaprio, Jason Statham, Michael Douglas, Richard Gere, Jeff Goldblum, Scott Disick, Dane Cook, Derek Jeter, Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee, Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, whoever the president of France is, Mel Gibson, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy, Kelsey Grammer, Larry King, Larry King, Larry King, Rod Stewart and Donald Trump.”

Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods are trying to work things out

In the mess that was the situation between Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson and Jordyn Woods, one person got caught in the crossfire: Kylie Jenner. It was her BFF that was involved in a kiss with her sister’s baby daddy and we all know what happened after that. What we don’t know is what will become of Kylie and Jordyn’s friendship. But according to People, there’s a chance the two (former?) besties and roommates can survive this.

“Their friendship is not 100% over,” said an insider, adding that while they haven’t spent any time with each other, they have been texting. “It’s still a tricky situation for Kylie. And no one is actually putting too much pressure on her. Her family is aware that she is in contact with Jordyn. They are letting Kylie figure things out for herself.” And Khloe can’t fault Kylie for that.

Woods is trying to ease back into things, reportedly even liking a recent photo Jenner posted on Instagram. Baby steps, right? If these two can find their way back together, that would be nice. And not surprising at all. Just as long as Khloe doesn’t do the same thing with Tristan. Because enough with that guy."

On Friday, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts by the grand jury. The “Empire” star was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month, in connection to the incident that he reported on Jan. 29 where he said he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

Chicago PD Supt. Eddie Johnson said Smollett staged the attack because he was displeased with his pay on the Fox hip-hop soap opera.

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was first formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing."

There are two seperate sets of charges, the first relating to his initial testimony to police, and the second resulting from his second interview with authorities. At best, he will get probation, and at worst, up to 64 years in prison, as each count carries up to four years’ prison time.

He is due back in court on March 14 to face these charges. While some are claiming this sentence is too long, it is believed he will probably strike a plea deal and avoid prison time. Still, many feel that there is a racial slant to this sentencing.

If your first thought about Jussie Smollett is “he shouldn’t have lied” as opposed to failing to recognize 16 felony charges is punitive and disparately applied to Black people, then you are indeed the problem of the criminal justice system. — Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) March 9, 2019

Whether you are rejoicing justice being done, angry about the sentence, or just appalled that he lied in the first place, at the very least we can say that this saga is wrapping up and he will be out of the spotlight.

Schmidt insisted her clients did nothing wrong in their part of purchasing the materials used in the alleged stage attack against Smollett.

“Have the prosecutors told them that?” Bill Hemmer asked.

“I don’t know what the prosecutors have said or not said but I know that in terms of their legal analysis they’re not in any legal peril,” she said.

“So what we do know is prosecutors say that Smollett enlisted the help of these two men. They are brothers. One of them worked out with the actor and one had been a stand-in on the show Empire. All that is true,” Sandra Smith asked.

“Yes, that’s true. What I would like to add to that is what this case really is about is a person who is in a position of trust who really betrayed my clients and who took advantage of them,” Schmidt said.

“They have tremendous regret over their role and their participation in this. But what they did was accept payment for training that also encompassed doing a favor for this person. So it is not — it’s not an easy narrative to say okay,’ let’s take $3,500 for this,'” she added.

“But it was your clients are the ones that allegedly went into ACE hardware and produced the receipt for the rope that made into a noose, is that correct? So they aren’t entirely innocent here,” Hemmer pressed.

“When you say innocent I’m saying they are remorseful for their involvement. That’s without a doubt,” Schmidt replied. “I was there to witness their realization process to see that this was something that was going to affect tremendous people across the board, have an enormous impact on minority populations. So I was there to see that realization process. They are remorseful for that.”

In addition to clarifying her clients' involvement, Schmidt noted that the $3,500 check Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers was for personal training and in an implied way, for helping him carry out the attack. ""It's unfortunately, a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I'm saying, 'Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor'... and the favor was to stage the attack,"" she explained.

Abindola and Olabinjo were arrested on Feb. 13 in connection with the attack on Smollett. Early in the investigation, Chicago police identified that one of the brothers had worked as Smollett's personal trainer, and the other had appeared as an extra on Empire. Two days after the alleged suspects were arrested, they were released from police custody, which is when news outlets began reporting that Smollett may have orchestrated the entire stunt.

As evidence began to mount against Smollett, he was officially classified as a suspect late last month. While his intent has not been definitively specified, many have suspected that Smollett carried out the attack for publicity purposes, and/or in order to secure higher pay for his role in the Fox series.

On March 8, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts for lying to the police regarding his attack. The Cook Country grand jury laid out two sets of charges, one regarding the information he gave to police the night of the alleged hoax, and the other based on the second interview he gave later that day."

The jury returned 16 counts connected to the case and an arraignment is due to occur this week.

CBS Chicago reports:

The grand jury returned the disorderly conduct charges on Thursday. He is scheduled to be arraigned on March 14. The specific allegations–“false report of offense”– are Class 4 felonies.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment.

The indictment expands the case against the actor. The counts focus on allegedly false statements he made to two different Chicago Police officers. Each count covers various alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers–including that he was hit by two men, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured a chemical on him.

“[The grand jury] decided he told multiple lies,” Miller said. “There were going to charge him for each.”

As it stands, Smollett is sticking with his story that the money he paid Empire extras Ola and Abel Osundairo for tips on getting fit, not to help him stage the attack.

Gloria Schmidt represents brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, aged 25 and 27. They say Smollett paid them to stage a hoax attack on him on January 29 as part of an elaborate scheme to get a raise.

In an interview on Good Morning America on Monday, Schmidt said the brothers were eager to help Smollett because they thought he could help them with their careers.

They were officially hired to train him, she said, but that Smollett also asked them to carry out the attack as a 'favor.'

'My clients were just taken advantage of by someone they trusted,' she said.

Schmidt dismissed Smollett's lawyers claims that it is only the brothers' word against his and says there is 'of course' corroborating evidence that the attack was a hoax.

She also confirmed that the $3,500 check Smollett paid the brothers which police said was for the hoax was in fact officially for personal training, as Smollett claimed, but that he muddied the issue by asking them to carry out the attack at the same time.

A lawyer for Abel and Ola Osundairo (left) say the brothers were 'taken advantage of' by Jussie Smollett who allegedly hired them to carry out a staged hate crime on him on January 29

'They were paid for the training, they were training together, but they were also asked to do this favor for him. Unbeknownst to them, this turned out to be a big betrayal.'

Asked if the check was explicitly for the training and not, as police say, for the attack, Schmidt replied: 'It would be such an easy narrative to see it that way but it's a very complicated relationship.

'If you're friends and I'm saying, ""Hey, I'm going to pay you for training but I'm also asking you to do me a favor"" and the favor was to stage the attack,' she said.

The brothers were questioned as suspects of a hate crime for 47 hours in February before they finally confessed to police that Smollett had asked the to attack him.

While Smollett's lawyers say it is their word against his, Schmidt insists there is other evidence to prove the brothers' story.

'That's why they went from being persons of interests to suspects. They are free men and they are at home,' she said.

In a later interview, she said the pair were 'tremendously regretful' for their role in the scandal.

Schmidt would not explain exactly what the brothers' motive was for participating but said they 'trusted' Smollett and thought he could help them.

Gloria Schmidt, the brothers' lawyer, went on Good Morning America on Monday to defend them

'I look at the dynamic between loyalty and someone who was in a position of trust with my clients who really just took advantage. They worked with Jussie on Empire, they are friends with him, they thought he could help their career.

'Obviously he has connections, he has a good position at Fox.

'This was someone they trusted to consider their best interests,' she said.

She insisted the brothers were not 'looking for anything' when they made their confession but would not confirm if they had been granted immunity from any possible prosecution in exchange for it.

Schmidt said the pair were now putting their lives 'back together'.

'This was life-altering. I saw them go through the realization process.

The brothers were filmed buying supplies to use in the attack in a store in Chicago the day before it happened. They say they used a $100 bill Smollett gave them

'They know this has impacted a lot of minority populations so they're working very hard to just move this in the right direction,' she said, adding she could say 'with confidence' that they 'did not commit a hate crime.'

Smollett has hired celebrity-favorite Mark Geragos who previously represented Michael Jackson and Chris Brown

In a later interview with CBS, she echoed her earlier points, saying: 'What they are really focused on right now is that they feel tremendously regretful for their involvement in the situation.

'All the other peripherals are outside of their main focus right now.

'You have someone here who is a celebrity type, someone who is in a position of trust, someone who works with these people, who is able to hep their careers if he so wants to and then he betrays them.

'This entire thing started because they trusted the wrong person.'

Smollett is now facing 48 years behind bars as opposed to just three after being hit with an additional 15 counts of felony disorderly conduct last week.

The fresh charges were returned in a grand jury indictment on Thursday.

Smollett's lawyers say the entire case is a witch hunt that has been driven by the media. The star will return to court on Thursday."

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his salary.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor’s bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct.

His lawyers have said they will “mount an aggressive defence” of Mr Smollett, who they described as “a young man of impeccable character”.

What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on 29 January.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck – a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said “this is Maga country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that “shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett’s personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was “dissatisfied” with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme “shameful”, adding: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career”.

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards."

Former Trump attorney and disgraced convicted felon Michael Cohen recently gave testimony before Congress focused upon negative allegations against his former boss. Those who spent their time watching the sordid political theater came away with two unavoidable, tired, previously known conclusions: Cohen is a proven liar and President Donald Trump, like each of us, is an imperfect person.

But for millions of Americans, myself included, the made-for-TV drama is largely irrelevant, as America is doing quite well under the controversial leadership of President Trump.

Before he became President Trump, everyone knew that “the Donald” was a controversial business icon. In fact, part of his appeal was the role he played as a billionaire playboy whose brash style help him rise to the top of the cutthroat business of real estate development. Whether roasting Rosie O’Donnell on prime-time television or entertaining millions on “The Apprentice,” Trump was known for being an unconventional and high-flying international businessman.

But now, as the president, his racy past has followed him to the White House and become an obsession for the Democrats, so consumed by hatred and so desperate to pursue an increasingly socialist agenda. What better crowbar to open Trump’s past and perpetuate a media war against him than his former attorney? After all, Michael Cohen is a desperate man still hoping to reduce his own prison term by bashing his former employer.

While Cohen’s recent testimony produced wall-to-wall coverage by political insiders, the press has been promoting hysteria ever since the 2016 election, using every chance to demonize the Commander-in-Chief. Hardly a week passes without some “shocking” revelation that is eventually proven wholly untrue or at least largely irrelevant.

Fake news is not just a tagline made famous by the president. It’s real, and it’s exhausting. In January, Cohen was the central figure in a BuzzFeed report that has since been discredited. In the report, Cohen states that he was instructed by Trump to lie to Congress.

Cohen is not the only example of the media’s desperation to attack all things Trump. In the past few weeks, their bias has been on clear display. The press prematurely hyped an edited video of a Trump supporter standing before a Native American provocateur. Of course, there is also the outrageous Jussie Smollett fiasco, in which the actor apparently faked a hate crime and ascribed it to alleged Trump supporters.

In the coming days, expect a flood of speculative reports from media personalities about the possible legal implications of this and that from Cohen’s testimony. Regardless, the fundamental reality is this: Our country is thriving economically, militarily and on the world stage. Cohen’s congressional performance is just another example of the mainstream media’s increasingly desperate attempt to exploit any situation that allows them to attack the president. But the American people know this: Unemployment is down. Wages and earnings are up. Our economic growth is healthy.

Militarily, the United States is properly funded and more equipped than ever, with ISIS all but eradicated. Trade negotiations that protect, rather than undermine, our interests are underway with numerous countries. The American energy sector is humming along.

America is surging forward, and the president is fulfilling his promise to make our country great again. The biggest threat to the strength of our democracy is our own media’s constant fanning of toxic flames of hatred toward our president.

Most of President Trump’s supporters know that he is not a perfect person, but they will continue to remain loyal and give him their support. The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it is often the most unlikely people who go on to accomplish the most. Consider the prophet Moses, widely regarded as one of the greatest of prophets in the Bible. Moses led the children of Israel out of bondage to the Promised Land, despite the fact that he was a murderer!

In this case, our nation is led by a businessman with many flaws who also happens to be the right person for the job at a time when America needs it the most. We are thirsting for economic progress, following eight years in the wilderness of Obama’s presidency. Our present prosperity far outshines the flashing lights of manufactured scandals.

Trump has delivered on so many of the promises that catapulted him into office. Despite the media and the establishment’s campaign against him, tens of millions of his voters will continue to stand by him. He may be an imperfect person, but the same can be said for every single one of us. Who among us can claim to be without flaws? Thankfully, Trump is right where he should be today: in the Oval Office, propelling our country forward.

“This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. … Someone they had trusted to consider their best interest,” Gloria Schmidt, who represents Chicago brothers Abindola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, said on “Good Morning America.”

Schmidt said the $3,500 check the brothers received, which was marked as a payment for a personal training program, was also intended, in a nuanced way, for the staged attack.

“They were paid for the training … but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” she told GMA anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Explaining further, Schmidt said: “If you’re friends, and I’m saying ‘Hey, I’m going to pay you for training, I’m also asking you to do me a favor’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Schmidt said the brothers were not looking for anything in return from police for telling the truth and reiterated what she’s said previously: They regret their actions.

“So you’re confident this was a hoax?” Stephanopoulos asked.

“I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime,” Schmidt replied.

“They’re working very hard right now to piece their lives together. … They know that this has impacted a lot of minority populations, so they’re working very hard to just move this in a positive direction,” she said.

TIMELINE: The Jussie Smollett investigation

The Osundairo brothers were, briefly, suspects in the attack Jan. 29 that Smollett described as racist and homophobic. Investigators say it was, in fact, staged — a hoax intended to generate publicity for the “Empire” actor, who was seeking a higher salary.

Chicago police investigated the case for three weeks, eventually identifying the two brothers with ties to Smollett — one had worked as his personal trainer, and both had been extras on episodes of “Empire” — as his “attackers.”

After 47 hours in police custody, the pair told police Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack in an effort to raise the actor’s profile and win him a higher salary for his role on the TV show.

The brothers were released without being charged.

Cook County prosecutors charged Smollett on Feb. 20 with felony disorderly conduct, the charge used for filing a false police report.

Smollett surrendered to police on Feb. 21 and has remained free on $100,000 bond.

On Friday, prosecutors expanded the charges to 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct.

They include charges for each crime he said he had suffered, with separate counts related to statements he made the night of Jan. 29 to a police officer, and then for repeating the same account to a detective the same night. The charges all are Class 4 felonies, the lowest category of felony offense under Illinois law.

Ilhan Omar ripped former President Barack Obama in an interview published Friday, belittling his ‘pretty face’ and saying his agenda of hope and change was an illusion,” the New York Post reports. “She cited the ‘caging of kids’ at the Mexican border and the ‘droning of countries around the world’ on Obama’s watch — and argued that he wasn’t much different from President Trump.” Fox News adds, “The broadside delivered at Obama is highly unusual for any Democrat, especially one who has been in the House for two months and has already ticked off party elders with her outspokenness.”

According to The Washington Post, “President Trump on Monday will propose major spending cuts across a range of domestic government programs while seeking a large increase for the Pentagon, a budget plan that’s already encountering withering opposition from Democrats who control the House, as well as some Republicans. … Even with deep spending cuts, the president’s plan would not balance the budget until the mid-2030s.” Reuters says Trump also “will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for the wall he promised to build on the southern border with Mexico to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking.”

“A federal judge in California who ordered the Trump administration to reunite more than 2,800 migrant families separated at the southwest border says potentially thousands more could be affected by his ruling. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw of San Diego said in a preliminary ruling issued late Friday that parents who were separated from their children on or after July 1, 2017, should be included as part of a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. … Sabraw said he will hold a hearing later this month to decide whether the government will have to identify and reunite the additional families.” (NPR)

“Ethiopian Airlines temporarily grounded its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes Monday, a day after one of them crashed shortly after takeoff, carving a gash in the earth and killing all 157 people on board. Thirty-five countries had someone among the dead, including the United States. There were at least eight Americans on the aircraft. There was no immediate indication why the plane went down in clear weather while on a flight to Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya, but the crash was strikingly similar to that of a Lion Air jet that went down in the sea off Indonesian last year, killing 189. Both accidents involved Max 8s.” (CBS News)

“Generation Z has a more positive view of the word ‘socialism’ than previous generations, and — along with millennials — are more likely to embrace socialistic policies and principles than past generations, according to a new Harris Poll,” Axios reports. Among these two generations, 73.2% believe in taxpayer-funded universal health care; 67.1% believe in taxpayer-funded college; and 49.6% would rather live in a socialist country.

Speaking of socialism… “Furious Venezuelans lined up to buy water and fuel on Sunday as the country endured a fourth day of a nationwide blackout that has left already-scarce food rotting in shops, homes suffering for lack of water and cell phones without reception. Authorities have managed to provide only patchy access to power since the outage began on Thursday in what President Nicolas Maduro called an act of U.S.-backed sabotage, but critics insist it is the result of incompetence and corruption.” (Reuters)

“‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts following his Chicago attack allegations. … The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.” (Fox News)

“A lawyer representing Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann said … that Sandmann plans to sue CNN for at least $250 million. … ‘CNN was probably more vicious in its direct attacks on Nicholas than The Washington Post. And CNN goes into millions of individuals’ homes. It’s broadcast into their homes,‘ [attorney L. Lin] Wood told [Mark] Levin. … 'You have a situation where CNN couldn’t resist the idea that here’s a guy, a young boy, with a ""Make America Great Again” cap on. So they go after him.’“ (The Hill)

""The [Trump] administration is drawing up demands that Germany, Japan and eventually any other country hosting U.S. troops pay the full price — plus 50 percent or more for the privilege. That may see some nations asked to cough up five to six times as much as they do now. If the plan gets traction it could prove to be a paradigm shift for U.S. foreign policy and its relationships around the world. It risks fanning debates in some countries about whether they even want U.S. troops and creating a vacuum that might give the advantage to the likes of China and Russia.” (Bloomberg)

“The Trump administration signaled Friday it intends to implement a ban on transgender people serving in the military after a federal court struck down the last injunction against the policy the previous day. … Former Defense Secretary James Mattis laid out a policy in March 2018 that would allow transgender people to serve if they do so ‘in their biological sex.’” (The Hill)

Policy: The Heritage Foundation’s Michaela Dodge says, “The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee demonstrated a scary lack of understanding of nuclear weapons policy Wednesday during a hearing seeking outside perspectives on the U.S. nuclear posture. Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., jumped at the opportunity to attack the U.S. fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles, known as ICBMs, calling them unnecessary for deterrence and easily identifiable targets. Smith misunderstands the value that ICBMs bring to U.S. national security and that of our allies, which is scary given the importance of the role he plays.”"

Lisa Shannon serves as executive vice president and COO of Allina Health, a 12-hospital system headquartered in Minneapolis. She assumed her position in July 2017.

Prior to joining Allina, Ms. Shannon worked as president of health system delivery and COO at Catholic Health Initiatives sponsored KentuckyOne Health, where she was responsible for care delivery and operations across the health network. She also held leadership positions at Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids, Mich. and OhioHealth in Columbus.

Ms. Shannon has spent her career driving change in the healthcare industry. She warns that without faster transformation and adoption, the healthcare industry will be disrupted.

""If we don't disrupt and change how we deliver care, we will be left with only the parts of the health system that others aren't interested in. That will hurt our community. It will hurt our patients. It will hurt our industry and ability to serve the most vulnerable in our country,"" Ms. Shannon explained.

Here, Ms. Shannon discusses more about the biggest issue she thinks the healthcare industry faces, explains her proudest moment at Allina Health and divulges the traits emerging healthcare leaders need to possess.

Editor's Note: Responses were lightly edited for length and clarity.

Question: What has been one of your proudest moments at Allina Health?

Lisa Shannon: There are so many things I'm proud of, but the things that I will always be most proud of are going to involve our people and what they've accomplished.

When I think about the way our team is advancing across several areas that are vital to patient care, that's what stands out. When I think the way staff or executives evolve from having intercompany competition to intercompany collaboration, I am proud. When I see staff lift others to make sure we are growing together, getting better together, spreading learning versus holding that knowledge in — those are the things I'm most proud of.

If you want a specific recent example, I would talk about how we have built out tiered escalation huddles that focus on ensuring patient safety, employee safety and improving access to care. Within just a few short months we were able to spread these huddles across every one of our sites of care and business units. We went live across all sites in October 2018. All together we brought them to life in under six months. The daily site huddle, which rolls into a daily 10 a.m. system huddle, is a method that allows us to transparently share patient and employee safety lessons and access issues. Because of these huddles, we are now solving problems collaboratively and faster than ever.

Q: Can you describe the greatest challenge you think the healthcare industry faces?



LS: I think the industry faces a lot of challenges. Broadly, our care isn't safe enough. It is far too inconsistent, and it's at a price point our patients can't afford. Because the healthcare industry hasn't been able to quickly transform, others are entering healthcare to solve problems that healthcare hasn't solved for itself.

I believe our inability to evolve quickly is going to result in the more margin-producing, less-complex care being taken out of our ecosystem. Instead, the more margin-producing procedures will be placed in niche programs and facilities outside of traditional healthcare. It will leave our hospitals and health systems caring for the most vulnerable and complex in our community. While this has always been one of our great privileges and important jobs, we will struggle to ensure profitable services that enables us to take care of the entire ecosystem of patients. As we move toward value, integration of care to prevent duplication, delays and other wasteful processes for patients will be essential. Health systems are uniquely positioned to enable value.

I'm very concerned for us as an industry. If we don't disrupt and change ourselves, we will be disrupted. We will be disrupted in a way that prevents us from doing what we've been known for, which is serving all — regardless of their ability to pay. Our communities rely on us to take care of patients at all levels of income, means, capabilities and complexities.

Q: What strategic initiative will demand most of your time and energy this year?

LS: Right now, we are focusing on how to become more consumer focused, how to find strategic partners to enable that, and how to create a more seamless integrated system of care at a better price point. When I think about my role, the initiative that will demand the most of my time in 2019 is accelerating the integration of our system including finding ways to partner with our physician stakeholders, including independent medical staff, employed physicians, and physicians interested in research and teaching, to drive change. I am also working to empower our clinicians and broader team members to bring the cost of care down, improve the reliability of our care and create better, more meaningful roles and work for all. In other words, the initiative focuses on how we create the most value for the consumer patient at a higher rate of reliability while also at a lower cost. The initiative around high reliability is important for us.

Q: Do you have specific concrete steps in place to improve reliability of care?

LS: Within our top clinical service lines, whether it be orthopedics, cardiovascular care or oncology, we are looking at how we create the most convenient, accessible care in the least wasteful way possible. When patients go from ambulatory to inpatient to post-acute settings, they often traverse a system that has a lot of fragmentation. When fragmentation occurs, unnecessary repeat procedures or missteps with communication can happen. We are really working hard to tighten that so we have fewer, or no, unnecessary care steps for a patient's journey and as tight a communication system so we produce the safest, highest quality, best outcomes at the most affordable rate possible.

Q: What traits do you think emerging healthcare leaders need most?

LS: Healthcare leaders today need to understand how to work across a very complex system and in a highly matrixed environment. They must have very strong influence and change-agent skills. I think they also need to be less afraid to fail and make mistakes. I'm not talking about patient mistakes, but administrative missteps by the virtue of trying and innovating. These days consumers compare their healthcare experience not just to healthcare, but to every other part of their lives. They are now comparing how we do against Amazon and every other convenience they have grown to expect. Healthcare leaders have got to be able to broaden the thinking of our clinicians and our teams to be able to adapt to the changing consumer expectations.

Q: If you could pass along one piece of advice to another health system COO, what would it be?

LS: Start with your team. Make sure you have the right leaders in the right roles. You must have the right people in the right team to be able to deliver any change. I believe that having a strong team starts with a mindset of collaboration and integration. I also say that I'd rather have the right people than the right structure at times.

CHICAGO -- The attorney for two brothers who authorities said helped TV actor Jussie Smollett stage an attack in Chicago said the brothers have ""tremendous regret"" for their involvement and that they were ""taken advantage of"" by Smollett.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jesse, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Schmidt said they were paid for personal training and asked by Smollett for a favor, which was to stage the attack.""It's unfortunately, a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I'm saying, 'Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor,'...and the favor was to stage the attack,"" Schmidt said.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison.Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew.

Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Schmidt said they were paid for personal training and asked by Smollett for a favor, which was to stage the attack.""It's unfortunately, a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I'm saying, 'Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor,'...and the favor was to stage the attack,"" Schmidt said.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison.Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on ""Empire"" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors say Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the ""Empire"" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""Chicago police have launched an internal investigation stemming from what they said were inaccurate leaks during the three week investigation into the alleged attack, but Superintendent Johnson stands by his officer's work."

Former Trump attorney and disgraced convicted felon Michael Cohen recently gave testimony before Congress focused upon negative allegations against his former boss. Those who spent their time watching the sordid political theater came away with two unavoidable, tired, previously known conclusions: Cohen is a proven liar and President Donald Trump, like each of us, is an imperfect person.

But for millions of Americans, myself included, the made-for-TV drama is largely irrelevant, as America is doing quite well under the controversial leadership of President Trump.

Before he became President Trump, everyone knew that “the Donald” was a controversial business icon. In fact, part of his appeal was the role he played as a billionaire playboy whose brash style help him rise to the top of the cutthroat business of real estate development. Whether roasting Rosie O’Donnell on prime-time television or entertaining millions on “The Apprentice,” Trump was known for being an unconventional and high-flying international businessman.

But now, as the president, his racy past has followed him to the White House and become an obsession for the Democrats, so consumed by hatred and so desperate to pursue an increasingly socialist agenda. What better crowbar to open Trump’s past and perpetuate a media war against him than his former attorney? After all, Michael Cohen is a desperate man still hoping to reduce his own prison term by bashing his former employer.

While Cohen’s recent testimony produced wall-to-wall coverage by political insiders, the press has been promoting hysteria ever since the 2016 election, using every chance to demonize the Commander-in-Chief. Hardly a week passes without some “shocking” revelation that is eventually proven wholly untrue or at least largely irrelevant.

Fake news is not just a tagline made famous by the president. It’s real, and it’s exhausting. In January, Cohen was the central figure in a BuzzFeed report that has since been discredited. In the report, Cohen states that he was instructed by Trump to lie to Congress.

Cohen is not the only example of the media’s desperation to attack all things Trump. In the past few weeks, their bias has been on clear display. The press prematurely hyped an edited video of a Trump supporter standing before a Native American provocateur. Of course, there is also the outrageous Jussie Smollett fiasco, in which the actor apparently faked a hate crime and ascribed it to alleged Trump supporters.

In the coming days, expect a flood of speculative reports from media personalities about the possible legal implications of this and that from Cohen’s testimony. Regardless, the fundamental reality is this: Our country is thriving economically, militarily and on the world stage. Cohen’s congressional performance is just another example of the mainstream media’s increasingly desperate attempt to exploit any situation that allows them to attack the president. But the American people know this: Unemployment is down. Wages and earnings are up. Our economic growth is healthy.

Militarily, the United States is properly funded and more equipped than ever, with ISIS all but eradicated. Trade negotiations that protect, rather than undermine, our interests are underway with numerous countries. The American energy sector is humming along.

America is surging forward, and the president is fulfilling his promise to make our country great again. The biggest threat to the strength of our democracy is our own media’s constant fanning of toxic flames of hatred toward our president.

Most of President Trump’s supporters know that he is not a perfect person, but they will continue to remain loyal and give him their support. The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it is often the most unlikely people who go on to accomplish the most. Consider the prophet Moses, widely regarded as one of the greatest of prophets in the Bible. Moses led the children of Israel out of bondage to the Promised Land, despite the fact that he was a murderer!

In this case, our nation is led by a businessman with many flaws who also happens to be the right person for the job at a time when America needs it the most. We are thirsting for economic progress, following eight years in the wilderness of Obama’s presidency. Our present prosperity far outshines the flashing lights of manufactured scandals.

Trump has delivered on so many of the promises that catapulted him into office. Despite the media and the establishment’s campaign against him, tens of millions of his voters will continue to stand by him. He may be an imperfect person, but the same can be said for every single one of us. Who among us can claim to be without flaws? Thankfully, Trump is right where he should be today: in the Oval Office, propelling our country forward.

CHICAGO -- The attorney for two brothers who authorities said helped TV actor Jussie Smollett stage an attack in Chicago said the brothers have ""tremendous regret"" for their involvement and that they were ""taken advantage of"" by Smollett.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jesse, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Schmidt said they were paid for personal training and asked by Smollett for a favor, which was to stage the attack.""It's unfortunately, a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I'm saying, 'Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor,'...and the favor was to stage the attack,"" Schmidt said.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison.Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett.

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment."

Geoff Marshall

A few days before last week's election, I got a call from a local political operative, freaking out over the fact that the lead items on the news were not about the upcoming mayor's race, but about the ongoing sagas of R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett.

""Nobody cares about anything except R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett,"" the politico exclaimed with an f-bomb or two thrown in for good effect. ""If this keeps up, you and I will be the only ones who vote!""

OK, that's an exaggeration. But the relative indifference of Chicagoans to local politics—as reflected by the turnout of 35 percent—proves what I call the Maya Dukmasova theory. Named for the Reader staff writer who coined it, the theory goes like this . . .

Damn it, Ben—get on Twitter!

Wait, wrong Maya utterance. No, the relevant Maya theory is that the local electorate is basically divided between those who passionately care and obsess about Chicago politics—like me and Maya and that freaking-out political operative—and those, alas, who don't.

And sad to say—these days it seems the don't-cares very much outnumber the do-cares. On the bright side, however, the news isn't as gloomy as we thought.

Going into last week's election, the spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election was predicting the lowest turnout for any mayoral election in history. We beat that rap—barely.

There were 557,000 or so ballots cast last week, or 35 percent of the electorate. That's up from about 484,000, or 34 percent, who voted in round one of the 2015 mayoral election, but down from the 595,000 or so (42.3 percent) in 2011.

But it is up from the 466,000 (33 percent) in the 2007 election. That race pitted Mayor Richard Daley against Dorothy Brown—arguably a low point in the ongoing experiment of democracy in Chicago.

I will now offer several of my own theories for the abysmal turnout, starting with . . . Donald Trump.

Usually, I'm blaming him for the vile and nasty things he does. But in this case I'm pinpointing something he didn't do. He wasn't on the ballot.

For better or worse, Trump's the great energizer in politics these days. Chicago's turnout in November's gubernatorial election rose to about 61 percent, largely 'cause so many Democrats viewed voting as an act of resistance to Trump—even if he wasn't on the ballot back then either. It's hard to make voting for mayor an act of resistance against Trump when all the candidates are already bashing him.

Then there's my friend, good ol' Mayor 1 Percent himself. I have a feeling turnout would have been higher had Mayor Rahm stayed in the race rather than wimping—I mean, dropping—out in September. He'd have probably generated a larger turnout just for being who he is—a symbol of cold indifference to inequality.

In other words, Trump and Rahm represent candidates people might get fired up to vote against. At the same time, there really weren't any candidates to vote for—or at least there was no clear choice around whom progressives could rally.

On the southwest side, people apparently got fired up over Jerry Joyce, the native son of a prominent 19th Ward political dynasty. The vote in many precincts in the 19th Ward topped 60 percent—practically an uprising for this election.

It makes me nostalgic for the mayoral election of 1983, where we had a citywide turnout of 82 percent for Harold Washington's epic showdown against Bernie Epton. In that election Epton, a moderate Republican, was turned into the ""Great White Hope"" trying to ""save"" Chicago (his tagline was ""before it's too late"") from Washington, who'd defeated Jane Byrne and Richard Daley in the Democratic primary. It was black people voting with pride and white people voting out of fear. Either way, it was the high point of voter participation for a mayoral election in Chicago.

Then, of course, there's the weather. Election Day was a typically cold and dreary day in February. You'd think that after 182 years (to be exact), the powers that be would have figured out that we have something called winter in Chicago. And that it's not a good time to have an election—unless you want a low turnout to help incumbents win.

Guess we just figured out why there's never been an effort to change the state law that mandates mayoral elections in February.

Beyond that there's something more insidious going on. Many Chicagoans have clearly given up hope that a mayoral election has any worthwhile meaning. Politicians and political campaigns come and go, and nothing seems to change, so why bother?

It's a vicious cycle. Vote for the same old, same olds and nothing changes. So it's easy to conclude that you might as well not vote at all. And what's the result? More of the same old, same olds.

The apathy is highest in the black south and west sides. I've seen precinct after precinct—like the third precinct in the Ninth Ward, or the 23rd in the 16th, or the 15th in the 20th—where turnout was in the teens.

No wonder Mayor Rahm feels free to take $1.3 billion intended for low-income neighborhoods—like those in the Ninth, 16th, and 20th Wards—and spend it on Lincoln Yards in an already gentrifying north-side neighborhood. As long as there are no repercussions at the polls, the inequities will continue.

I'm not sure what I can offer as a way of remedy—other than moving the mayoral election to a warmer month. I mean—duh, people.

Here's hoping that the upcoming runoff between Toni Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot fires up the voters. In 2015, roughly 41 percent of voters turned out for Rahm's runoff against Jesús ""Chuy"" García.

If we can't do better than that, we have to live with the reality that the 35 or so percent of the people who vote will essentially rule the 65 percent who don't.

It's called democracy in Chicago. v"

Although I’d gotten to know Jussie Smollett a lot better over the past few weeks than I would ever have wanted to, something I had been unaware of until I looked him up this morning is that he is half-black, half Caucasian…and that half is Jewish.

That led me to wonder how many other notable Americans are half and half. I already knew about Barack Obama and Derek Jeter, both of whom had white mothers.

But it’s a fairly long list that includes actors, actresses, singers and even a basketball player. Just a partial list includes Dwayne Johnson, Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Bob Marley, Eartha Kitt, Rashida Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Lisa Bonet, Mario Van Peebles, Jennifer Beal, Smokey Robinson, Maya Rudolph, Vin Diesel, Ben Harper. Grant Hill and Carol Channing. CAROL CHANNING?!

That’s right, although she was only a fourth-mixed. Her mother was Caucasian, her father was half and half.

A bigger surprise was how many of their white parents were, like Jussie Smollett, Jewish. With parentage that is a combination of black and Jewish, they could no more help being liberals than I can help being cute as a button. Albeit, a short, bald button.

What’s fascinating is how dominant the black DNA is, no matter which parent is white and which is black. With the possible exceptions of Maya Rudolph, Jennifer Beal, Dwayne Johnson and, of course, CAROL CHANNING, one would assume the others were black. And, left-wing propaganda aside, it didn’t seem to prevent any of them from achieving success in this allegedly racist society.

Wisconsin’s favorite son, Wayne Brenholt, periodically reminds me that when I complain about the temperature plunging down into the 50s here in L.A. he, as well as most of you, regard that as a heat wave.

The other day, he wrote to say that in February, they’d had 33 inches of snow in Chetek. I made him aware of the fact that everyone knows that men lie about such things and that it was my hunch that it wasn’t more than 27 inches.

I find it odd that Jill Abramson, who was fired by the New York Times from her editorship, and Lara Logan, who recently split from CBS and “60 Minutes,” have received a lot of attention for merely stating the obvious, which is that the American media is liberally biased.

I mean, talk about old news. After all, it was way back in 2001 that Bernie Goldberg published the blockbuster best-seller, “Bias,” that put him on the map. To some of us, it seemed blatantly obvious even then. But in the age of Trump, for two women to garner so much attention for repeating what Goldberg wrote 18 years ago seems almost as far-fetched as creating a stir by pointing out how suspicious it was that the weather hoaxers went overnight from warning us about something as specific as “global warming” to something as amorphous as “climate change.”

In the aftermath of my wife’s death, I came across all manner of things I hadn’t seen or even thought about for many years.

One of the oddest was the following invitation dated April 14, 1980: “You are cordially invited to attend my divorce party on Saturday, April 26th, at 8 p.m.

""There will be booze and cold cuts provided…the quality and quantity of which will be determined by the property settlement announced by the judge early next week. (Lilavati, I suspect, will be having her party catered by Chasen’s.)

""However the judge rules, I will try not to put a pall on the festivities by being bitter and wallowing in self-pity. Instead, in typical Prelutsky fashion, I will get drunk and boorish and pass out by 9:30. In case I’m still passed out under the table when you leave, I hope you will have had a wonderful time.

""I want you all to know that I’m not holding any of you responsible for my present situation. I even take a certain pride in knowing that the children of two lawyers will have college educations and perfect teeth, thanks to my legal fees.

""But enough about me. In the future, you’re all going to have to take some responsibility for my actions. So, from now on, if you even see me within 100 yards of a rabbi, priest, minister, justice of the peace or ship captain, call a cop, hit me with a brick, place me in irons, have me declared non compos mentis or, at the very least, tamper with my blood tests. RSVP regrets (meaning that you can’t come, wise guys, not that you can). As ever, Burt.”

Five years later, I got married for the third time and it was for keeps. Or at least until January 14, 2019.

Speaking of Yvonne, for all her many virtues, the woman was an Olympic-class hoarder. I, on the other hand, abhor clutter. It is, I believe, undeniable proof that God likes a good joke as much as the next guy that men like me who feel hemmed in at the Grand Canyon wind up married to women who can’t bring themselves to toss out old magazines, pieces of string and dresses that have had forty years to make a fashion comeback and have, as yet, shown not the slightest inclination to do so.

Which brings me to my present situation. I have seen hundreds of movies and TV shows and read even more hundreds of books that dealt with the death of a loved one, be it a parent, a spouse or a sibling, and not once have I been told how labor-intensive it is.

They certainly don’t skimp when it comes to relating the grief, the loneliness, sometimes even the guilt and unresolved issues, but, at least in my experience, they never bother letting you know how exhausting it is to deal with the details.

It begins with funeral arrangements and deciding on a guest list, and whether there should be a post-funeral gathering and where it should be. The cost alone will come as a shock if you’ve never been through it before.

But, then, even before you can take a break and sift quietly through the memories accumulated over 33 years, you’re tossed into a whirlpool that includes, but is not limited, to dealing with lawyers, banks, credit card companies, Social Security and attempting to sell a car that hadn’t yet been paid off. I even found myself trying to explain to our dog just what the heck was going on.

Part of the shock was that because I knew that women on average live five years longer than men, I assumed I would go first. Yet another of God’s little jests.

I will close with one of Stephen Hanover’s own little jests.

One evening, a mother is braiding her young daughter’s hair when the child turns to ask her mother if she had wanted to have a little boy or a little girl. “Actually, sweetheart, I just wanted a back rub.”"

Its decision to drop Fox News as a setting for primary debates for the 2020 election is one of those great surprises that should come as no surprise. Instead of considering the Fox approach to media, the Democrats are amplifying the distrust many Americans now have for traditional news outlets. Fox pundits are openly biased, but CNN anchors still claim to be referees. In this game, officials must not root for a side.

The decision would be novel if it was not so off the mark.

But in this case today there is little that Democrats should concern themselves with over Fox handling their debates. Fox programming is distinctly labeled to keep bias out of reporting. “Wait right there,” you may be screaming into your monitor, “but Hannity!” What is compelling about the news and opinion format of Fox is that correspondents and pundits are clearly marked. Ratings grabbers like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson do not claim to be unbiased journalists. It is this formula that allows viewers to determine who has an agenda and who does not.

For all of its faults, MSNBC has been more open about its liberal bias. It is still not as seamless in its transitions between news and opinion, but at least the network is somewhat open about it. Not so for CNN. The network has now become a hollow shell of the original concept from a man who thought marrying Jane Fonda was a good idea. Its bias has been amplified by personal hatred of Trump. Chris Cuomo claims his lack of partisanship, but his own brother is one of the most partisan governors in the nation.

Don Lemon is so much of a hack that he said he would not shake hands with Trump and has claimed that white men are the biggest terror threat in the country. I guess he gets points for creativity. The biggest clown must be White House “correspondent” Jim Acosta, who will likely need rotator cuff surgery for excessive back patting. Acosta has accumulated such accolades as a “terrible person” and took down a news cycle for finding a way to get his White House press pass pulled briefly last year.

I previously wrote about the blurring of fact and opinion in left leaning media. Two years since then, bias has only been amplified by the fig leaf of impartiality. Besides the networks, the New York Times, Washington Post, and others have editorial creep, allowing opinion to leak into their analytical reporting. What was ignored under President Obama, from “caging children” to a golf simulator at the White House, are now given the spotlight as means of denigrating his successor. Trump gets heat for actions the media never revealed when they happened under Obama.

Recent fumbles have only played into the bad perception of media bias. Networks downplayed the story of two racists and an alleged rapist, all of them Democrats, in top state government positions in Virginia. Reporters howled over smirking teenagers at the March for Life, describing one as a school shooter. Every journalist worth their salt breathlessly parroted the false attack story of Jussie Smollett and claimed that doubt was the result of “right wing smears.” The disintegration of each story shows the power that Democrats hold in the media. It is as if most news outlets by default give liberal politicians and left wing causes a nice home field advantage.

The Democratic National Committee believes that it can use this edge in its attempted shaming of Fox. Instead, the difference between Fox and all its competitors has never been clearer. Fox is formatted much like an old fashioned newspaper with objective reporting and opinion editorials in separate sections. CNN and its mainstream media partners have, in the interests of defeating Donald Trump, placed the entire newspaper in a blender and are upset that you are not able to sort fact from opinion.

One of the most troubling and dare I say “problematic” developments in colloquial speech has been the overuse of the phrase “my truth” to blur absolute truth and opinion. Fox presents designated facts and opinion. CNN presents its truth every day. Our discourse is worse because of it.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a spokesperson for the force confirmed that ""an internal investigation has been opened.""

""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" the statement continued. ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a sandwich shop in the early morning on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before fleeing.

But that isn't how police say it all went down.

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. After turning himself in, a judge set Smollett's bond for $100,000 and he was released from jail. If convicted, he will face up to three years behind bars.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the ""check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]"" to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 ""for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.""

He said the attack ""was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) 'staged attack' where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence. The actor's legal counsel told Fox News after Smollett was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his team continued.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

President Trump to renew fight over wall funding

After a spending dispute that closed parts of the government for a record 35 days, the president plans to ask for $8.6 billion for a wall on the southwestern border in the budget that he submits to Congress today, aides said."

The ‘Empire’ actor is facing the charges after it was alleged he filed a false police report when he claimed to be the victim of a homophobic and racist hate attack on January 29

11 March 2019

According to Variety, a Cook County grand jury handed Jussie the indictment on Friday (08.03.19), after the actor was previously charged with a single count for the alleged false filing, which carries the possibility of up to three years in prison.



Of the 16 new counts, eight charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight are for a more detailed account given to Detective Kim Murray.



Jussie had told police he was assaulted at 2am by two men who shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white.



The indictment read: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed.”



And although he faces several charges, former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg says the number of counts won’t have an effect on Jussie’s sentence, should he be convicted.



Andrew told Variety magazine that the counts will run concurrently, so the sentencing range would still be one to three years in prison.



He added: “I would still expect a period of probation, a psychological evaluation and restitution to cover costs of the investigation. I would still be surprised if he goes to prison.”



Jussie has denied the allegations against him, and his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson recently said a “thorough investigation” into the claims is still ongoing.



They said: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.



""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Even as Johnson was preparing a pink slip for coach Todd Bowles, Maccagnan sold Johnson on his plan to put the organization on the right path.

Now, the pressure to deliver on that plan is on.

There is no question about the temperature of Maccagnan’s seat entering 2019. It is a notch below the surface of the sun.

Maccagnan will open free agency’s negotiating period Monday afternoon armed with plenty of salary cap space and more holes on his roster than Jussie Smollett had in his story.

This is a defining moment for Maccagnan, who is 24-40 in his time as the Jets’ GM. To put it simply, he is out of chances. If he does not deliver this offseason, he will be looking for work next offseason.

But free agency is a tricky game for general managers and Maccagnan must navigate this deftly. It is simple for fans and media members to look at a list of names and pick out all the best ones the Jets should sign like you’re ordering off a menu. Give me Le’Veon Bell from column A, Trey Flowers from column B and I’ll finish it off with the best offensive linemen you have.

In reality, free agents are free agents for a reason. The teams that know them best have cast them aside. Sometimes it is age, sometimes it is injuries, sometimes it is a lack of production. But there is always a reason they become free.

Maccagnan should know this as well as anyone. His big free-agent signings have blown up in his face more than once. Darrelle Revis grabbed some headlines for the Jets in 2015, but was a shell of his former self. The Ryan Fitzpatrick re-signing was a mess. Even signing one of their own — Muhammad Wilkerson to a five-year, $86 million deal left Maccagnan looking bad.

Last season, Maccagnan gave cornerback Trumaine Johnson a five-year, $72.5 million contract. Johnson gave up several huge plays, committed a few awful penalties and failed to show up for work in Week 17. Let’s just say the early returns on that signing are troubling.

This year is a test to see if Maccagnan has learned from his mistakes. Signing the best cornerback available like Johnson does not mean you are getting a player worth the money he commands in free agency. Prices get inflated when you have desperate teams trying to plug holes.

The best teams draft well, develop those players and supplement through free agency. Maccagnan has not drafted all that well either, which is why fans expect a spending spree this week.

Maccagnan’s best free agent deals have been the second-tier free agents he has signed. James Carpenter (4 years, $19.1 million), Steve McLendon (3 years, $10.5 million), Kelvin Beachum (3 years, $24 million) and Avery Williamson (3 years, $22.5 million) have all been valuable signings by Maccagnan.

This is what fans, and especially Maccagnan, must keep in mind this week. Being “aggressive” in free agency as Maccagnan has said the Jets will be is not as important as being smart about free agency.

The Jets have $83 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com, after agreeing to the trade for guard Kelechi Osemele on Sunday . That sounds like a lot until you consider the Jets need to replace a third of their roster. They have a league-high 25 free agents. They also need to stash some of that money for their draft picks and for in-season pickups.

If Maccagnan is smart, he will stay in the Le’Veon Bell sweepstakes only until the price tag climbs above $14 million per season. He will concentrate on fixing his offensive line [Osemele was a good start], adding a pass rusher and finding a cornerback. But that does not mean spending crazy money on every top free agent. Maccagnan must do his damage in that second tier where value can be found. Add one or two big names, but build the locker room for Adam Gase through free agency’s middle class and the draft.

Maccagnan can’t afford to get this wrong or there will be no convincing Johnson to keep him this December."

Take WaPo and CNN: both are being sued for $250 million by Covington High School student Nicholas Sandmann who along with classmates on a school trip to D.C. in Janurary were smeared by these outlets and others pushing a political narrative.

In an interview on Fox News, Sandmann’s attorney L. Lin Wood told host Mark Levin, “CNN was probably more vicious in its direct attacks on Nicholas than The Washington Post. And CNN goes into millions of individuals’ homes. It’s broadcast into their homes.”

“They really went after Nicholas with the idea that he was part of a mob that was attacking the Black Hebrew Israelites, yelling racist slurs at the Black Hebrew Israelites — totally false,” Wood continued. “If you took the time to look at the full context of what happened that day, Nicholas Sandmann did absolutely nothing wrong. He was … the only adult in the room. But you have a situation where CNN couldn’t resist the idea that here’s a guy, a young boy, with a ‘Make America Great Again’ cap on. So they go after him.”

Wood’s right. CNN’s coverage on the incident was part of a social media firestorm, destroying the teens reputations by painting them as racists who don’t respect people of color or veterans who risked their lives for the country. The backlash was so intense the boys were subjected to death threats and Covington High School had to be closed for “safety concerns” following the incident.

Then the truth emerged the Native American man, Nathan Phillips, wasn’t a “war hero,” that he never served in Vietnam despite the media’s portrayal of him. Then evidence surfaced that the boys didn’t accost Phillips — that he was the one who confronted them, instigating the provocation.

All of which illustrates that media today — acting as defacto PR firms for the DNC — will destroy anyone’s life or reputation in its ongoing war against Trump.

Facts be damned.

If media were vetting stories for truth and accuracy, the Covington students would not have been smeared the way they were.

Many news outlets also rushed to defend disgraced “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett who fabricated a hate crime against himself and made the allegation a political hit-job with his claim the fake assailant said “this is MAGA country,” during the assault. Media ran with the hoax, again, trying to paint Trump supporters as racist, violent homophobes. Smollett has since been arrested and indicted on 16 felony counts for making the whole thing up.

Perhaps a lawsuit or two will encourage media to start reporting the news honestly, fairly and objectively.

A tall order, I know."

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1

(ThyBlackMan.com) Buried beneath a blizzard of news stories about Michael Cohen’s sentencing, the sexcapades of R. Kelly and Michael Jackson and the Jussie Smollett fiasco was some interesting reporting on the deadly role of racism in contemporary American society.

A new study by the Trust for America’s Health and the Wellbeing Trust revealed that in 2017 more than 151,000 people died from suicide and causes related to drugs and alcohol – an all-time high. This follows a three year trend of decreasing life expectancy in America, while global life expectancy continues to rise. Rural areas like Montana and West Virginia – Trump country – were especially hard hit.

In his just released book, Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America’s Heartland , Dr. Jonathan M. Metzl, Director of the Vanderbilt Center for Medicine, Health and Society gave some surprising and revealing reasons. From his interviews with people living in rural America, he described the “mortal trade-offs white Americans make when they vote with the goal of restoring their racial privilege and end up endorsing political positions that directly harm their own health and wellbeing.”

He found that policies promising to bolster white American’s status have instead made life “sicker, harder and shorter” for all Americans. For example, things like lax gun laws have resulted in increased white male suicides and opposition to the Affordable Care Act – Obama Care – shortens white life expectancy. He cites his conversations with white Tennesseans who “voiced a willingness to die, literally, rather than embrace a law that gave minority or immigrant persons more access to care.”

This information should inform Democratic policy positions as they prepare for the upcoming 2020 presidential elections. Their internal debates over whether to seek to expand the base of minorities, millennials and women versus going after working class white voters who voted for Obama and then for Trump gain new clarity when viewed from the perspective of these findings. Taken together with political studies of Trump voters in 2016, it’s hard to see how any Democratic appeals for economic or social welfare programs to ameliorate racial disparities will overcome this deep-seated fear of loss of white privilege.

Since the imposition of tariffs on China and during the government shutdown earlier in the year, we have seen the president’s supporters, who despite personal losses, still maintain their support for him. One of the most telling quotes from a government worker who was laid off during the shutdown was, “I’m still for him, but he’s hurting the wrong people” – like he was expected him to hurt “other” people, just not them. Farmers losing money on soybean sales due to tariffs have expressed the same sentiment.

Robin Di Angelo, author of the New York Times bestseller, White Fragility, provides some useful insight. She says, “In my experience, day in and day out, white people are absolutely not receptive to finding out their impact on other people.” She defines white fragility as “the inability of white people to tolerate racial stress.” Her prescription for a solution is right on. She says, “Racism is a white problem. It was constructed and created by white people and the ultimate responsibility lies with white people. For too long we’ve looked at it as if it were someone else’s problem.”

Racism is the sickness behind the sickness affecting white America. Dr. Metzl’s work shows that the increases in suicide, opioid addiction and the overall decrease in white life expectancy can, in large part, be traced directly to a desire to not see “other people” get ahead. Robin Di Angelo got it right. If we want to defeat racism, more white people have got to join the fight. Thank goodness some, especially young people, are.

AP-Yonhap



A grand jury in Chicago indicted ''Empire'' actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.



The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday (local time) and made public Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black, openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.



The indictment _ eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective _ comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.



Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime, but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.
