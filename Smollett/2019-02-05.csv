Douglas Golden', 'Wnd Staff', 'Ryan Foley', 'Patrice Lewis']",,"['smollett', 'right', 'far', 'farright', 'henderson', 'poole', 'trump', 'extremist', 'chicago', 'patrick', 'white']","(American Spectator) -- Are you a “far-right extremist”? There’s a simple test to find out. If you doubt that homophobic Trump supporters are prowling the streets of Chicago looking to beat up gay TV stars, you’re a “far-right extremist,” according to Alex Henderson of AlterNet. Henderson declared that “some extremists on the far right” — including syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin — are responsible for suspicions that actor Jussie Smollett was not attacked by Republicans in the wee hours of Tuesday morning. Only an “extremist” could doubt Smollett’s story, according to Henderson, although Chicago police have so far been unable to verify it. As Patrick Poole of PJMedia observed Thursday, “the ongoing investigation into the alleged hate crime… has raised more questions than it has answered.” While the area near where Smollett claims to have been attacked is “heavily monitored,” Poole noted, police who “have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance video” couldn’t find any that showed the alleged attack. But Patrick Poole is probably an “extremist” by Henderson’s standards, and maybe the Chicago cops are, too.

Getting labeled “far right” is astonishingly easy in the Trump era, when Democrats and their media allies would have us believe that the White House is occupied by the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and that the nearly 63 million Americans who elected him are “white nationalists” or “alt-right” or some other scary term.

Call it art imitating life (or cry “Girl, same.”), but some events in Blues for an Alabama Sky seem like you could have just read about them in the news. However, the show was not only written more than 20 years ago, but it’s also set in 1930s Harlem.

When the play’s queen bee, Guy Jacobs, a gutsy gay black man, gets attacked by “young hoodlums down the street trying to prove their manhood,” you may cue the recent alleged assault on openly gay Empire actor Jussie Mollett in Chicago.

I won’t spoil other plot points, but take it from actor Chad Promise: “Everything in the show is what people in coffee shops are talking about today—racism, classism, abortion. We encounter them every day. If we don’t learn from history, we are bound to repeat it.”

Promise, who isn’t gay, portrays Guy, who is “disheveled” when he arrives for “high tea” with a small blood stain on his snazzy ensemble of tuxedo pants, a formal shirt with an ascot, and a silk smoking jacket.

“You’re bleeding!” cries his gal pal Angel Allen.

“No, I’m not. But somebody is!” boasts Guy. “If you ever see me in a fight with a bear, you help the bear.”

Girl, same.

The play’s director, Renee van Nifterik, who has been distracted this week dealing with a suicide watch for her husband’s friend (girl, whose life is easy?), says that she’s “only heard a snippet” about the alleged assault on Mollett. “I don’t know very much, except that he was attacked for being gay. Guy was also attacked for the same reason. I don’t know Smollett’s reaction, but we could all take a page from Guy’s book, and that is to not change to appease anyone and to not live in fear or hide who you are. Be who you are, and be bold! Guy’s strength of character comes from being unapologetically who he is, knowing what he wants from life, and having the guts to go for it.”

The play by Pearl Cleage continues through Feb. 10 as the Pearl Theater’s annual Black History Month show.

“Even though it is set 90 years ago, it deals with issues that are still relevant today,” says van Nifterik.

Promise, who is 27, is a former basketball standout at Baytown Lee High School, where he graduated in 2010.

“My freshman year, I took theater as an art credit, and I enjoyed it so much that I came back,” he says. Success in roles such as Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew and Prince Eric (Ariel’s love interest) in The Little Mermaid helped convince him to major in theater at San Jacinto College in Pasadena.

Promise says he’s “not sure when I learned to accept homosexuals. I was always raised to accept everyone. I wasn’t in close proximity with homosexuals until I got to college. The first really good friend I met when I was in college was homosexual. Although I didn’t find out he was gay until later in our friendship, it never changed the fact that he was, and continues to be to this day, one of the best friends and people I’ve ever met in my life. Still today, I have many, many [gay] friends.

“Guy Jacobs lived in a time when not only was it not accepted to be homosexual, but it was so rare to cross paths with one that when most folks did, it was hard to accept. Unfortunately, we still have issues with accepting homosexuals in our country, just like we have issues with accepting people of different races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, etc. It’s a part of this country’s history. This play symbolizes so many things we continue to go through today. Although we’ve come a long way, it proves we have so much further to go.”

After earning an associate degree in theater and film at San Jac, Promise enrolled at West Texas A&M University in Canyon.

In nearby Amarillo, some 10 hours from Baytown, he portrayed Horse (as in “hung like a horse”) in the musical The Full Monty.

“And yes, we did the nude scene,” he says. “At the end when we went ‘the full monty,’ there was a bright light that flashed us, creating a silhouette. It was definitely the most freeing experience I ever had on stage. The director and the guys in the cast were just amazing throughout the entire experience. It was absolutely incredible. Of course, I had a lot of fear at first, but the process was so smooth and the people around the production were so supportive and that made it a lot easier. The show was a big hit!”

Returning home, Promise says he had “no qualms” about portraying a gay man in his own backyard.

“Once I read the script and found out how rich the character was in substance, [his sexuality] wasn’t at the forefront of my thinking process as an actor,” he says. “My job as an actor is to portray characters and their stories, so being able to step out of Chad and step into Guy was all I wanted to do.”

Rounding out the cast of Blues for an Alabama Sky are Jasmin Roland, Caprice Carter, James West III, and Eric Williams as Leland.

That’s a high bar, GOP lawmakers say, particularly on Trump’s signature issue.

And while a number of Republicans have sought to dissuade Trump from declaring a national emergency, they may not embrace a public fight on Trump’s signature issue — which risks earning the wrath of his conservative base ahead of the 2020 election.

GOP lawmakers also predict that Trump can win over some Republicans by presenting the declaration as something dictated by an urgent need at the border instead of an effort to simply circumvent Congress.

The president can further bolster his argument by assuring Republicans that funding will not be reprogramed from top-priority defense accounts, such as the military construction account, which pays for defense facilities and family housing.

Sen. Kevin Cramer Kevin John CramerWhen will Americans — all Americans — declare that enough is enough? Republicans prepare to punt on next COVID-19 relief bill GOP senators introduce resolution opposing calls to defund the police MORE (R-N.D.) on Tuesday predicted the vast majority of his Republican colleagues will wind up backing Trump if Democrats manage to force a vote on a resolution blocking a declaration.

“I think most will, in fact maybe an overwhelming amount will,” said Cramer.

Sen. John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.) on Tuesday also said his fellow Republicans will likely fall into line.

“I’ve learned in this place talk’s cheap,” he said on CNN.

“Let’s see how they vote,” he added. “If the president does it, I’m willing to bet you a lot of Republicans who are saying it’s a bad idea and he shouldn’t do it, they’ll vote to support him.”

Cramer acknowledged colleagues are worried about the precedent and that for some it’s a “really big deal.”

But he added that the president’s power to reallocate funding is set up under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which also gives Congress the power to terminate his decision.

“The Constitution and our laws provide, the statutes provide this opportunity, provide this oversight,” he said. “If he does this, it’s not my view the constitutional Republican will collapse.”

Trump has threatened to call an emergency to fund a border wall if a special Senate-House conference fails to reach a deal he would accept by Feb. 15, when 25 percent of federal funding is due to expire.

Negotiators are making progress but significant issues remain unresolved, in addition to the main sticking point of the border wall itself. They also have yet to agree on how to pay for additional border security.

Conferees will receive a special closed-door briefing from experts on Wednesday about what they think is needed to secure the border.

Under the National Emergencies Act, a resolution terminating Trump’s declaration of national emergency would be deemed privileged and guaranteed a vote on the Senate floor.

Even if it passes, Trump could veto it, and Republicans are confident they have the 34 votes it would take to sustain it on the Senate floor. But it could set up an ugly and public fight.

Manchin, a leading Democratic centrist, on Tuesday reiterated his support for Trump declaring a national emergency, arguing it is preferable to another government shutdown.

“If that’s what it takes not to shut this government down again and let the courts weigh in and decide, so be it,” he said. “I’m not going to deny him. Everything else has failed. We can’t seem to operate on our own very good.”

With Vice President Pence providing the deciding vote in case of a 50-50 tie, Democrats would need to pick up five defectors to pass a disapproval resolution.

Many Republicans say their votes would depend on how Trump frames his request.

Sen. Rob Portman Robert (Rob) Jones PortmanBipartisan Senate group offers bill to strengthen watchdog law after Trump firings Bipartisan group of senators unveils bill to protect research on campuses from foreign entities Trump's push for major infrastructure bill faces GOP opposition MORE (R-Ohio), who served as White House budget director under President George W. Bush, said Trump has “about a half-dozen different options” on how to direct funding to build a border wall without express authority from Congress.

One possibility would be to use funds that are not already obligated to other priorities instead of declaring an emergency, Portman said.

Traditionally, reprogramming executive branch funding requires the sign-off of the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate and House appropriations subcommittees of jurisdiction, but a senior Democratic aide acknowledged that Trump could break with precedent and go forward without such congressional approval.

Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulWhite House throws support behind GOP police reform bill Rep. Andy Barr's wife dies suddenly at 39 Senate GOP unveils police reform proposal MORE (R-Ky.), one of Trump’s staunchest allies, warned “the separation of powers between spending power being a congressional power and not a presidential power is a pretty big one.”

“We don't know what route the president's going to take, so I'm not going to speculate on it at this point,” said McConnell, who reportedly warned Trump in a face-to-face meeting last week against declaring an emergency to build the wall. “I'm going to withhold judgement about that until we see what he does.”

If the president moves forward, he will have a powerful ally in Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyFights over police reform, COVID-19 delay Senate appropriations markups Trump's push for major infrastructure bill faces GOP opposition Watchdogs express concern to lawmakers about ability to oversee coronavirus relief funds MORE (R-Ala.), who argued Tuesday that the president is within his power to declare an emergency.

“I believe that he’s got some standing under the Constitution to do that and also the statute,” Shelby said. “If we don’t settle and solve the problem or try to solve the problem of the border security and the president does it — something we fail to do — I would support the president.”

Shelby said that staff have exchanged several offers and that the Senate and House conferees have boiled the talks down to what he called “central stuff.”

“The central stuff is barriers, walls, fences, more people, more technology, the whole comprehensive approach,” he said.

Asked about how Congress would pay for beefed up security measures, Shelby said, “We haven’t got a lot of it figured out but we’re trying and time’s ticking away.”

Ralph Northam for the abhorrent photo that appeared on his page in his medical school yearbook: If bigotry is repugnant, why not demand the resignation of Vice President Mike Pence for his ugly views on homosexuality? And while they're at it, why not insist that Pence's wife resign her position at a school that discriminates against gays and lesbians?

I can guess their answer: Pence and his wife are deeply religious, and their views on homosexuality are based on their religious convictions. To this, I say, so what? The Bible was used to justify slavery, and in my own time, racists cited this or that biblical passage to assert that racial segregation was precisely what God intended − the so-called ""curse of Ham"" or the ""mark of Cain,"" both used to add biblical authority to the rantings of bigots. Now the mark or the curse is on the Pences, who share views that in our nation's history have caused much suffering, including violence.

The other thing Republicans would be sure to say is that racism is different than ""mere"" anti-gay bias. Yes, indeed. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. Virginia is the state that once led the nation in number of slaves. The inhumanity of slavery is hard to fathom. It's harder still to comprehend that great men − Washington, Jefferson, Madison ... you know the names − not only condoned it, but benefited from it.

Later came slavery's progeny − the Jim Crow era. I am talking of everything from the absurdity of segregated state parks to the barbarity of lynchings. In Atlanta in 1899, a black man was mutilated and then burned with portions of the body distributed to the crowd. The man's name was Sam Hose. He was probably innocent of murder but not, of course, of being black.

The destructive power of blackface and KKK robes in that yearbook picture cannot be underestimated. But let's ponder, too, the harm of hateful homophobia. It has taken countless lives over the years, caused huge suffering and, like racism, persists to this day.

Homophobia is a staple of the racist right − Nazis, white nationalists and other adherents of mindless goonery − and results in the murder of gay and transgender people. In 2017, 20 gay, bisexual and queer men were murdered in hate crimes, an increase of 400 percent from 2016. This problem is hardly going away. And, infamously, in 1998, Matthew Shepard, was beaten, tortured and left to die on account of being gay. Last year, his ashes were interred in the Washington National Cathedral in a ceremony presided over by a gay Episcopal bishop, with music provided by Washington's Gay Men's Chorus.

And when racial hatred and homophobia are combined, the results can be particularly disturbing. Last week, singer and actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two men who allegedly yelled anti-gay and anti-black epithets.

Pence has been long been criticized as hostile to LGBTQ issues. He has linked same-sex couples to a ""societal collapse"" and even once seemed to support conversion therapy, which is a form of torture. A vice president who has expressed such intolerance is a dangerous model.

In certain corners of the right-wing media, criticism of Karen Pence for recently taking a job at the Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, was denounced as nothing less than religious bigotry. After all, the argument went, the school was a Christian school, ultra-conservative and ultra-traditional, which was entitled to teach according to its deeply held beliefs. No doubt. But while America has traditionally given religion wide berth − and still does − lines have been drawn. Utah was not admitted as a state until the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy.

No one is advocating a law requiring Immanuel Christian to practice tolerance, both in its pedagogy and its hiring practices. But the First Amendment that guarantees the school's rights also gives us the right to criticize. It is simply wrong to foster a belief that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are immoral.

I have been torn about Northam − about whether a single yearbook photo negates a lifetime of tolerance. But I am not torn about Mike and Karen Pence. They are figures of consequence and their bigotry − regardless of their religious justification − has to be confronted.

On Monday, Bennett announced it had raised $8.2 million through its #StandWithBennett social media campaign that garnered the attention of celebrities, alumnae and others who rallied to help the school.

Bennett, in Greensboro, North Carolina, was facing the prospect of losing its accreditation last month due to financial instability. It's a problem shared with other private HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities), which have long been underfunded. If the school were unaccredited, Bennett would lose access to federal financial aid and student's degrees may not be recognized.

According to Bennett College president Dr. Phyllis Dawkins, more than 11,000 donors chipped in to help the school. Donations included a $1 million gift from from High Point University, $77.25 collected in quarters from students at the Erwin Montessori elementary school, and a $20 bill handed over by a man who walked into the school's business office.

Jussie Smollett, the actor who portrays Jamal Lyon on ""Empire,"" wore a ""Stand with Bennett"" T-shirt in a Twitter post, prompting some of his fans to donate. Smollett was in the headlines last week after he said unknown assailants hit him, poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

In the 1930s we had 121 #HBCUs now we’re at 101.

A chorus of HBCUs including Spelman and Morehouse rallied behind Bennett as well, with students posting photos on Twitter with the #StandWithBennett hashtag.

""The universe of these schools came together to say 'we can't lose another HBCU',"" said LaDaniel Gatling, Bennett's Vice President for Institutional Advancement, who is among the team leading Bennett's move forward.

According to Gatling, Bennett had a history of debt for the past 12 years which was exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis. With the school unable to show financial stability, its accreditor, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), voted Bennett out of membership, saying its probation couldn't be extended for a third year.

""When you are about to lose what you have -- it makes leadership and stakeholders think differently and say, 'hey, we gotta stop going here',"" Gatling said.

The college's only option to remain with SACS was to appeal the decision, which they did last month. Bennett will remain an accredited institution until a hearing in February that will decide its status. Until then, Bennett set a deadline to raise funds to prove in the appeal that they can manage to stay afloat.

HBCUs have a history of being underfunded and face discrimination in public and private funding, said Dr. Marybeth Gasman, director of the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions. While many private HBCUs such as Spelman are thriving today, decades of lower funding, along with alumni with less access to wealth, means that these schools typically have smaller endowments.

""If you've been underfunded for the majority of your existence you are not going to have the same funding as other colleges,"" Gasman said.

Gasman has written that 74 percent of HBCU students receive Pell Grants, a rate that reveals widespread financial need. Many students at schools like Bennett are the first generation in their families to go to college, and look for schools that offer strong scholarships and financial aid.

Last academic year, Bennett started offering institutional full-ride scholarships. Princess Bush, a sophomore, received one her freshman year. Bush is majoring in biology and hopes to attend medical school or pursue a PhD. When she first heard about Bennett's financial distress, she wasn't sure how to feel because transferring was not part of her plan.

""I figure that could be an issue because programs do require a certain accreditation,"" said Bush.

Bush said she was attracted to Bennett because of its history in educating black women, which includes a strong sense of community in its student club life and academics.

""At this point I've decided to just wait and see what the end is going be,"" she said.

There has been a large uptick in freshman enrollment in HBCUs over the past five years, which some scholars have dubbed the ""Missouri Effect"" following student protests that erupted over racial tensions at the University of Missouri. Freshmen who have been asked why they chose an HBCU have pointed to the cultural climate in the country and a sense of increased racism, saying HBCUs are a safe place to turn.

""HBCUs are being looked at not only an educational environment but as a safe learning environment,"" Gasman said.

In its social media campaign, Bennett used its history in picketing against segregation during the civil rights movement to communicate to donors the importance of its fight to stay alive and relevant today.

Gasman said she has never seen a college about to lose its accreditation rally so much support through social media. She believes HBCUs need to start using social media more to relay to all communities their history and uniqueness.

""It was beautiful how the alumni rallied around the institution. They have to keep doing it. They have to continue to do that. Otherwise it doesn't work,"" Gasman said.

Another private HBCU, Saint Augustine's University in Raleigh, North Carolina, just got its accreditation from SACS extended after it was put on probation for financial reasons. The Greensboro News and Record reports the school invested $1.7 million into a large restructuring campaign.

However, other private liberal arts HBCUs have struggled to keep their accreditations. Last year, a judge ruled against Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, in a lawsuit that meant the college would lose its accreditation with SACS. Paine turned to the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) for accrediting instead, which gave the school full accrediation status. Earlier this month, Paine was able to keep its accreditation with SACS and is currently with both SACS and TRACS.

Bennett submitted a new report to SACS to show how it will use $8.2 million raised to reduce its debt. Bennett's Board of Trustees created a Re-Engineering Committee to change its business model, evaluate academic programs, and increase scholarships to attract more competitive students. Gatling said Bennett hopes to stay with SACS because of the prestige. However, if Bennett loses its appeal he said they ""have taken steps"" to look for accreditation elsewhere.

Despite this outpouring of support for the school, Belle Wheelan, president of SACS, said Bennett still needs to prove to an appeals committee on February 18th that it will have a sound financial plan moving forward.

Wheelan said the fundraising and awareness campaign serves as an ""awakening"" for alumni of HBCUs to contribute to their institutions after they graduate.

""I think this indicates that every dollar matters,"" said Wheelan.

Meanwhile, Bennett Belles -- as the women of Bennett College call themselves -- are rejoicing in their fundraising victory. The current Miss Bennett College, Brooke Kane, in her sash and tiara, addressed the press conference at Bennett's chapel for the fundraising announcement before ringing the campus bell, another Bennett tradition.

""Belles are strong and they will never stop historically ringing."" she said. ""And a Bennett College crown tilts for no one."""

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

The report noted that the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but that another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet’s neck.

“We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he’d received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed.

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

The report noted that the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but that another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet’s neck.

“We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he’d received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don’t yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

A police spokesman told reporters on Monday that new video was being “downloaded and reviewed.” Authorities are looking for more details about the incident, during which Smollett said he was accosted by two masked men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs and then wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him. One of the assailants, the actor later said, yelled “MAGA country!” as they left.

Though police have reviewed video evidence that Smollett had a rope around his neck when he arrived at his apartment building early on Jan. 29, they haven’t yet seen footage of the attack itself, according to Fox News. Security footage has led them to two unidentified persons of interest, and Smollett said his attackers seemed to know who he was, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, a gay black actor-musician who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series “Empire,” spoke out for the first time this past Friday, three days after the alleged attack, as rumors swirled about the details of the incident.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he told Essence in a statement.

On Saturday, during a musical performance in West Hollywood, California, he got more specific. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,” he told the crowd. “I went to the doctor immediately. … I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

Chicago police have said that Smollett is cooperating with the investigation and that there’s “no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Fox News reports."

He added, ""This was nearly 40 years ago.""

The controversy began after the Schindler's List actor recounted a painful incident from his past in relation to the current film he was promoting. Neeson narrated that a woman close to him had been attacked and raped. He did not reveal who the victim was but said he found out about the crime when he returned home from a trip.

""She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way,"" Neeson told the newspaper, which published an audio excerpt. ""But my immediate reaction was ... did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person.

""I went up and down areas with a cosh [crowbar], hoping I'd be approached by somebody. I'm ashamed to say that, and I did it for maybe a week -- hoping some [Neeson gestured air quotes with his fingers, according to the Independent] 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.""

Neeson also said that his primal instinct took over: ""I was trying to show honor, stand up for my dear friend in this terrible, medieval fashion.""

Neeson was then asked about why did you ""ask about color. You didn't ask if the person was tall or short, big or small. You immediately went to race.""

The actor conceded that, but said he did ask those other questions. He also admitted that he felt horrified at himself and this urge to kill that had taken over him. He took the help of a priest to get through this stage. Read: Empire's Jussie Smollett, Victim Of A Possible Racially-Charged Assault

Neeson’s interview started a firestorm on social media where people accused him of using stereotypes to define black people. However, the next day Neeson said that he wanted his original comments to start a wider conversation about racism. At another promotional interview for his film Cold Pursuit, he said, ""We all pretend we're all politically correct in this country...in mine, too. You sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry and it's there. ""

Neeson is originally from Northern Ireland and he also recounted the violent protests that engulfed the country during the 1960s and 70s which he says also led him to conclude that “Violence breeds violence,"" he said. ""Bigotry breeds bigotry.""

According to Hot New Hip Hop, this week the outspoken podcast host and his crew at State Of The Culture unpacked the details of the hate crime and touched on why some people refuse to believe it even happened.

First, Budden starts off by giving an overview of what we know so far, stating the Empire actor, “was allegedly brutally attacked recently in Chicago by ‘MAGA terrorists.’ They broke his ribs, they put a noose about his neck, they poured bleach on him and called him derogatory names. The FBI is on the case now but it has confirmed that a letter was previously sent to a FOX studio that contained threatening language and a powdery substance said to be Tylenol.”

While all those present acknowledged a noticeable uptick in hate crimes over recent years, Budden’s skepticism remained steadfast as he opined that he found it hard to believe any Black man would keep a noose around his neck 45-minutes after being let go by his assailants. He also mocked the letter allegedly sent to FOX saying it looked “like some bulls**t I saw in Austin Powers.”

While the Love & Hip Hop star does concede that the attack probably happened, some of the details still seem too sensational to be true.

“Famous rich people, when bad things happen and they want to cover the story” Joe stated while expressing his distrust for Hollywood in general. “You cover the story to protect your image, your likeness and your career.”

Budden clarifies that his biggest concern is that this story is being used to manipulate the emotions of a community that’s already on edge. Adding, “I’m waiting for footage. Just show me footage and I’ll shut the f**k up.”"

His portrayal of Jamal Lyon on Empire has received critical acclaim. Critics have called the role groundbreaking and offered praise to Smollett for his command of the dynamic and complicated character. More recently Smollett has found himself in the news after being the target of a hate crime in Chicago, according to The New York Times. Before his role in Empire and before he was the vicious target of violence, Smollett was lighting up the big and small screen, and you probably don’t even realize you’ve seen him before!

Jussie Smollett is easily recognizable in The Mighty Ducks

Smollett appeared in The Mighty Ducks opposite Emilio Estevez in 1991. In his role, Smollett played Terry Hall, one of the members of the ragtag hockey team Estevez’s character coaches as part of a DUI sentence. He did not reprise his role in the film’s sequel. Smollett was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his work on the film, according to IMDB.

Smollett appeared in North in 1994



Smollett followed up his work in The Mighty Ducks with a small role in North. North is a comedy-drama about a 9 year old who feels that his parents don’t appreciate him. He lobbies a judge for the chance to find a better family. The character of North, played by Elijah Woods, traverses the globe to a find the perfect family to fit his needs. Smollett played Adam, a friend of North’s in the film.

Jussie Smollett starred in a television series in the 1990s



Shortly after his role in North, Smollett was cast in On Our Own. The television show ran for 20 episodes before it was canceled. The show follows the lives of seven recently orphaned brothers and sisters as they navigate the world without their parents. Smollett acted with his real-life siblings, Jazz, JoJo, Jocqui, Jake and Jurnee in the short-lived sitcom.

A hiatus from acting

After On Our Own Smollett took a significant break from acting. He does not appear with a film or television credit until a 2009 credit for the short film Pitch This. During his hiatus from the acting world Smollett attended traditional school and stayed active in performing arts and music, but the majority of his childhood was relatively low key.

According to Out, Smollett never considered himself a child star, just a working actor. He attributes the acting hiatus to not quite fitting into a mold just yet. Such issues are not uncommon for child actors. During the teen years it is difficult for many child actors to find work as they grow and change. Even when he was off the big and small screen, he was performing. He notes he wrote music and performed it whenever possible from the age of 13.

Smollett also developed a love of food and cooking during his time away from Hollywood. Smollett appeared, along with his siblings, in a Food Network show that featured the close-knit family enjoying meals, events, and BBQs together. The siblings have since gone on to publish a cookbook.

Life on Empire

Smollett was cast in the role of Jamal Lyon in 2015. The character, raised in Philadelphia must figure out how to navigate the music world. Smollett went on to sign a recording contract, in part because of his work on the television show. He remains a pivotal character on the beloved drama.

Acclaimed hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz is calling for a serious compensation overhaul from streaming music services.

Without artistic content, streaming music services would be worthless. So now that platforms like Spotify are worth billions, why aren’t artists getting a bigger cut of that?

Perhaps more importantly: why are producers, songwriters, and performing artists still receiving such paltry per-stream payouts?

Longtime hip hop producer Swizz Beatz, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, is the latest artist to discuss the growing elephant in the room.

“I’m friends with all the streaming companies, but what I will say on record to them is we’re not getting enough money for those services and those companies to be trading for billions of dollars,” Dean told MarketWatch’s Jeanette Settembre this week. “I feel that the creatives should be 50/50 because without music, what are you going to stream?

“Without content, what are you going to stream?”

From an industry standpoint, streaming platforms have sparked a turnaround in once-dying recorded music assets. But pound-for-pound, industry veterans remember a far more lucrative business. So do artists, producers, and everyone else in the creative food chain.

“Streaming is the big topic,” Swizz Beatz stated. “I’m still wrapping my head around it just because I’m not one to get excited with hype.

“My thing is like I see the hype, it seems cool, everybody is chasing it, but what does it really mean? I remember when we were selling a million physical records, for real.”

Fun Fact: Swizz Beatz is actually a Harvard Business School graduate. So he’s more than qualified to look at the obvious math issues at hand. “Streaming became very important as a database, but is that database translating into real currency like what we were doing in the late 90s, selling 10 million records?” Beatz questioned.

“I feel that the advancement of the technology should match the advancement, currency wise, of the artist.”

Streaming magnates like Spotify cofounder Daniel Ek fail to see a problem, however. Ek and others argue that artists are benefitting enormously from streaming — while pointing to billions in royalty payouts.

Ek often waxes about the economic boom created by Spotify, and the positive impact that his platform has had on the broader music ecosystem. But that impact rubs both ways, with Spotify wielding enormous influence over once-powerful platforms like radio.

“The radio now pulls from streaming services,” Dean relayed. “If a song is not streaming a certain amount of numbers, then the radio knows to pull off the record.”

Concert promoters and festival bookers are similarly tuned in. A popular or trending Spotify artist is more likely to resonate with live audiences, and boost a broader festival bill. But without positive data, the decision becomes far more difficult.

Beatz himself is definitely diversified beyond recordings.

As a producer, publishing is also a major revenue source. But Swizz is also making money off of lucrative sponsorships, with partners like Reebok allying with the influential urban star. Those deals obviously pay better than Spotify — but then again, Spotify can help to seal brand sponsorships with the right data.

That’s not as strong a factor for an established star like Swizz Beatz, who owes a lot of his popularity to the major label machine. But sponsorships remain lucrative options for some artists, some of whom have blown up on streaming platforms.

Add touring, broader publishing, and even celebrity investments into the mix, and streaming can certainly fuel a broader career.

Sounds like huge upside for the rare success story. Then again, does that rationale justify an unfair streaming split?"

Festicket has just secured another major investment to continue its expansion into more key markets.

Several months ago, British online booking platform Festicket confirmed a fundraising milestone.

The company secured $10.5 million in a Series D funding round. Transatlantic venture capital firm Beringea led the fundraising round. Jaguar Land Rover’s venture capital fund InMotion Ventures, Channel 4’s Commercial Growth Fund, Lepe Partners, U-Start, and Eelko Van Kooten, former CEO of Spinnin’ Records, also joined in.

Most recently, the booking platform has focused on expansion into the North American and Asian markets.

With the funding, Zack Sabban, Festicket’s Co-Founder and CEO, confirmed the company would accelerate the international expansion of its business model. Festicket has also bolstered its management team with senior executives hired from companies including Live Nation, Eventbrite, and Channel 4.

In addition, the online booking platform would also use the money to continue building its discovery and community network through new marketing channels.

Now, the company has a new investment to unveil.

Edge-ing out the competition.

Edge Investments, a creative industries specialist, has invested $4.6 million in Festicket.

The online booking platform has also confirmed it now works with over 2.5 million customers, over 1,200 music festivals, and 4,500 suppliers across 50 countries around the world.

Festicket says that the new investment will further its entrance into new markets, primarily North America and Asia. The new funding will also further the development of the company’s underlying technology platform.

Investment Director David Fisher led the investment from Edge, alongside Investment Manager Josh Burge.

In a statement, Fisher said,

“The experience, events and festival markets continue to grow exponentially and Festicket is strategically positioned to benefit from these combined trends as a horizontally integrated platform.”

The incident took place Friday at Charles Drew High School and a parent posted the viral video of the teacher, who is also a football coach, throwing the teen to the ground and punching him.

Yaquanda Lucas, the student’s godmother and legal guardian, told the station that the teacher had teased the teen about wearing a stocking hat that belonged to his deceased grandmother.

“He had his hat on and his stocking and he said the teacher said, ‘quit cutting up your momma’s stockings and wearing them on your head,’” Lucas said. “He said (the teacher) was picking on him, trying to make the class laugh, and that made him upset.”

While one video appears to show the teacher assaulting the student another shows the student throwing a desk in the English class before the fight occurred.

“That didn’t look like restraining him to me,” Lucas said. “It looked like you beat my child.”

“I don’t excuse him throwing the chair. I don’t,” Lucas said. “There’s a way to handle these kind of kids, and that’s not the way that you do it.”

Lucas said the teen suffered a minor concussion and the student suffered from a mental health condition that district officials knew about.

“They need to start doing further background checks on teachers and getting in tune with what’s going on on the outside, too, because you don’t know who’s working in the schools,” parent Kapreshia Greenwood told WSB-TV. “They have to do better with being more teacher than friends.”

The Clayton County School District said they cannot comment on personnel matters nor can they report if the student would be disciplined for his actions.

“Since this matter remains under investigation, the district can not comment further,” a spokesperson said."

The shocking claims against one of the most prominent figures in Costa Rica have been levied by psychiatrist and anti-nuclear activist Dr. Alexandra Arce von Herold, who sat with federal prosecutors for nearly three hours to file a criminal complaint on Monday, the New York Times reports.

Von Herold claims that Arias, now 78, assaulted her in his home in 2014 while she was there to discuss an important upcoming event in Vienna related to her activism in nuclear disarmament. While there, she alleges he approached her from behind, touched her breasts, put his hands up her skirt and penetrated her vaginally with his fingers.

“I just froze, and I didn’t know what to do,” she said in an interview. “I was so much in shock. That had never happened to me before.”

DEATH, DOGS AND A MISSING $190 MILLION: THE STRANGE CASE OF CRYPTO EXCHANGE QUADRIGACX

Arias was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for designing a plan to end civil war in Central America. He served two terms as President of Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990 and 2006 to 2010.

Through his lawyer, Rodolfo Brenes, Arias issued a short statement proclaiming his innocence.

“I deny categorically the accusations made against me,” he said. “I have never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman.”

At the moment, Arias is facing unrelated allegations of criminal malfeasance for his connection with the approval of a gold mining project by a Canadian company in 2008 before the necessary environmental analyses had been conducted.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT ATTACK INVESTIGATORS WITHHOLDING SOME INFORMATION UNTIL THEY HAVE 'ALL THEIR DUCKS IN A ROW'

Von Herold, who is the daughter of a legislator with Arias's party, reportedly visited his home many times with her mother before returning to discuss the event in Vienna. She claims to have told at least 15 people about the alleged assault, including her boyfriend, mother, father and brother. In an interview, her brother said that for a week after his sister told him about the incident, ""it was like she had PTSD,"" he said. ""She didn't feel safe.""

At one point last year, she reportedly wrote lengthy posts on Facebook and Instagram detailing her allegations against Arias, but later deleted them at the suggestion of a Costa Rican journalist who warned her that they might have ""negative repercussions.""

Leveraging such a severe claim against a man of Arias' legacy was incomprehensible before the wave of the #MeToo movement spread through the United States, Von Herald said. After watching the allegations against prominent American figures like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein unfold, she says she was finally motivated to come forward with her story when she watched gymnasts testify against Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar.

“All the other women, that did, that helped me,” she said. “So I thought maybe, maybe, I can help other people too.”

She remains fearful of the response from Arias and the rest of her country, but said that she knew other young woman working around Arias were at risk.

“It’s the right thing to do,” she said, “even if it destroys me.”"

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

The report noted that the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn't want to report attack, but that another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett's request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet's neck.

""We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,"" Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he'd received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don't yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story. On Saturday, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the audience that if he did not perform his attackers would win."

I hate the word “alleged.” I just do. Especially when you know a crime was committed because all the evidence is there in black and white for the world to see. The word “alleged” to me, maybe not in the court of law, means it may or may not have occurred.

Take the recent hate crime case of Jussie Smollett, award-winning singer and actor from the television show “Empire.” He was viciously attacked by two white men (According to TMZ) in masks and all black clothing as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago. They called him a faggot and the n-word and tied a noose around his neck, punched his face kicked him and poured a chemical on him while yelling, “This is MAGA country!” referring to Donald Trump's slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

Then, on Wednesday, Jan. 30, while scrolling through an R&B radio station's website for an event, I caught its story on Jussie Smollett and saw the words “alleged attack.” That infuriated me. I wondered how many LGBTQ hate crimes went unreported for reasons such as shame, being outed, fear of another attack, not wanting to worry their family and friends, self-rejection, thinking the police might not help. These are some psychological effects that can deter people from reporting hate crimes. The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett captured my attention and that of the media, showing the reality that these attacks are happening to people across the U.S. every day.

What is a hate crime?

A hate crime (also known as a bias-motivated or bias crime) occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of her or his membership (or perceived membership) in a certain social group or race. A hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence. Examples include (but are not limited to): sexual orientation, gender identity, physical appearance, ethnicity, sex, language, nationality and religion. You could experience physical assault, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, hate mail, rape or damage to property to name a few examples.

According to the American Psychological Association, people victimized by violent hate crimes are more likely to experience psychological distress than victims of other violent crimes. Specifically, victims of crimes that are bias-motivated are prone to post-traumatic stress, safety concerns, depression, anxiety and anger.

What can you do if you are the victim of a hate crime?

According to Victim Connect, you should: call 911 for immediate assistance; record what happened; file a police report; lean on trusted friends and family; reach out to an advocate for support; find an attorney; and, if you don't trust local authorities, file a report with the FBI's Civil Rights Program.

Other resources out there for you are the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender National Hotline (888-843-4564 and glbthotline.org), which provides telephone, online private one-to-one chat and email peer support, as well as local resources for cities and towns across the U.S. In Milwaukee, the Milwaukee LGBT Community Center has an Anti-Violence and Counseling Program and a Report Violence department. Their number is 414-292-3070 and the Center's general line is 414-271-2656.

The Center is dedicated to reducing violence perpetrated against LGBTQ individuals through community outreach, education and facilitating healing from recent or past violence and trauma through counseling and advocacy. They help victims and survivors aged 14 and older with crisis counseling, accompaniment to court, medical exams and advocacy. They also offer crisis counseling and stabilization Monday-Friday during business hours by a trained mental health professional. All information is kept confidential (mkelgbt.org).

Let me tell you something: I saw Jussie Smollett perform live last summer at Pridefest, and did he shine! You and I shine just like Jussie, and our light can never be dimmed by any act of racial or homophobic hate. Let us continue to fight for love, fight for justice and fight for equality here in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin, across the nation and throughout the world!

In December, black comedian Kevin Hart offered a non-apology for saying he would beat his son with a chair if he were gay. Recently, an Iowa Republican Congressman declared his white supremacy with barely a shrug from his GOP colleagues. A Democratic governor’s clueless black face confession brought calls for resignation, but, at least for now, he won’t. The smirk seen ’round the world of a Kentucky Catholic boy in a MAGA hat is being defended by high-powered lawyers threatening lawsuits and even the president. To be fair, that debacle was fueled in part by racist and homophobic slurs hurled at the boy’s white school group by radical Black Hebrew Israelites.

Then, in Chicago, gay African American singer-actor Jussie Smollett (a Milwaukee PrideFest 2018 guest celebrity) was attacked by white men invoking “MAGA.” Despite evidence to the contrary, the apparent hate crime has been called a hoax by certain black bloggers who shamed the victim with homophobic epithets. When, among other black entertainers, Kevin Hart offered sympathetic words for Smollett, critics pointed to his earlier violently homophobic jokes as causing the attack he now decried.

Given all that (and more), local LGBTQs of color might wonder what Black History Month means in this, the Stonewall Riots’ 50th anniversary. It may conjure last year’s 50th anniversary of Milwaukee’s racial unrest. There wasn’t much celebration of positive changes that event brought about because there haven’t been many. Milwaukee is still the country’s most segregated city with the same disparities as ever in health, education and employment. As if to underscore that reality, a recent mock Milwaukee map identified our quaint neighborhoods with such names as Artisanal Fetishists (Bay View) or Yuppies in Warehouses (the Third Ward), while the central city got The Shooting Gallery (53206) and The Mob Beating District (Sherman Park).

Similarly, Stonewall’s impact on local communities of color seems negligible. While the same social inequities persist among LGBTQs of color as in the rest of the population, they also endure discrimination from both outside and within based on their sexual orientation.

I recall going to the Factory in the 1970s, where a back bar (open only on weekends) tended to be almost exclusively black, while the front bar was all white. Decades later, in 2011, Diverse and Resilient’s “Acceptance Journeys,” a multi-phase billboard campaign depicting alternative families, intended to bridge the cultural gap. Although studies concluded the project had positive results in other cities, its Milwaukee run was never completed due to funding issues.

It’s hardly reassuring that Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brian Hagedorn has been condemned by both the Human Rights Campaign for his attacks on LGBTQ rights and black leaders for his assault on the NAACP, which he called a “disgrace to America.”

Coming to the rescue, perhaps, is U.S. Rep. “Auntie” Maxine Waters, the African American firebrand, who issued a powerful pro-LGBTQ statement calling for confrontation of inequality and the empowerment of those of “different lifestyles” who are the targets of discrimination. We can only hope."

The report confirmed what was previously reported, that Smollett did have a white rope dangling from around his neck from the attackers. He also had a chemical, believed to be bleach, thrown on him, which stained his clothes. The two men were reportedly dressed in all black.

Chicago police have said that they have video of Smollett walking away from the two alleged assailants and also video of him with a rope around his neck. The police department has placed at least 12 detectives on the case and released images of two shadowy figures. Smollett was treated by doctors at a Chicago hospital, but he was not seriously injured.

And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now… let’s do it.”

Arias was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for designing a plan to end civil war in Central America. He served two terms as President of Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990 and 2006 to 2010.

Through his lawyer, Rodolfo Brenes, Arias issued a short statement proclaiming his innocence.

“I deny categorically the accusations made against me,” he said. “I have never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman.”

At the moment, Arias is facing unrelated allegations of criminal malfeasance for his connection with the approval of a gold mining project by a Canadian company in 2008 before the necessary environmental analyses had been conducted.

Von Herold, who is the daughter of a legislator with Arias's party, reportedly visited his home many times with her mother before returning to discuss the event in Vienna. She claims to have told at least 15 people about the alleged assault, including her boyfriend, mother, father and brother. In an interview, her brother said that for a week after his sister told him about the incident, ""it was like she had PTSD,"" he said. ""She didn't feel safe.""

At one point last year, she reportedly wrote lengthy posts on Facebook and Instagram detailing her allegations against Arias, but later deleted them at the suggestion of a Costa Rican journalist who warned her that they might have ""negative repercussions.""

Leveraging such a severe claim against a man of Arias' legacy was incomprehensible before the wave of the #MeToo movement spread through the United States, Von Herald said. After watching the allegations against prominent American figures like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein unfold, she says she was finally motivated to come forward with her story when she watched gymnasts testify against Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar.

“All the other women, that did, that helped me,” she said. “So I thought maybe, maybe, I can help other people too.”

She remains fearful of the response from Arias and the rest of her country, but said that she knew other young woman working around Arias were at risk.

“It’s the right thing to do,” she said, “even if it destroys me.”"

New Details About The Claim That He’s From The U.K.,[],https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/styles/listing_big/public/image_blog/21-savage2.jpg?itok=JEQrBdEc,"['abrahamjoseph', 'ice', 'hes', 'arrested', 'atlanta', '21', 'abolish', 'rapper', 'uk', 'details', 'immigration', 'savage', 'claim', 'visa', 'savages']","He could be deported.

Rapper 21 Savage was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for allegedly overstaying his visa. He is actually from the U.K., the agency claims.

The 26-year-old rapper, whose real name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, is in ICE custody after he was arrested in Atlanta Sunday in a ""targetted operation"" involving both local and federal law enforcement, according to the Associated Press.

“We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings,” his lawyer Dina LaPolt told TMZ. ""Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in the country — especially in Atlanta, Georgia, and is actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.""

Instagram

21 Savage, who has frequently rapped about his Atlanta upbringing and has long been considered a local Atlanta rapper, entered the U.S. legally in 2005 but has overstayed his Visa, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Bryan Cox said in an emailed statement to the Washington Post.

“Mr. Abraham-Joseph initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the U.S. when his visa expired in July 2006,” Cox said in the statement.

An ICE spokesperson reportedly told CNN correspondent Nick Valencia that 21 Savage's ""whole public persona is false.""

""He actually came to the U.S. from the U.K. as a teen and overstayed his visa,” the spokesperson reportedly added. The Grammy-nominated rapper faces deportation.

""Mr. Abraham-Joseph is presently in ICE custody in Georgia and has been placed into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts,"" ICE said in a statement to CNN. ""ICE will now await the outcome of his case before a federal immigration judge to determine future actions.""

21 Savage's Attorney Charles H. Kuck claimed he applied for a U-Visa and the application is pending, TMZ reported. ICE is trying to ""unnecessarily punish him"" as he waits for the application to be approved. Although the agency has known about his Visa status, they waited to take action against 21 Savage until now. Kuck said ICE is trying ""to intimidate him into giving up his right to fight to remain in the United States.""

Some reports claim 21 Savage is from the Caribbean island of Dominica, a British territory.

21 Savage entered the rap scene in 2015 and has since hit the top of the charts with his single ""Bank Account"" and his features on other hits like Drake's ""Sneakin',"" Cardi B's ""Bartier Cardi,"" and Post Malone's ""Rockstar."" His latest album, I Am > I Was, landed him his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in December.

He is nominated for two Grammy's in the upcoming Grammy Awards on Sunday.

The Internet was quick to react to 21 Savage's arrest.

Many took to social media to bash ICE, claiming the rapper's arrest is fraudulent.

A police spokesman told reporters on Monday that new video was being “downloaded and reviewed.” Authorities are looking for more details about the incident, during which Smollett said he was accosted by two masked men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs and then wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him. One of the assailants, the actor later said, yelled “MAGA country!” as they left.

Though police have reviewed video evidence that Smollett had a rope around his neck when he arrived at his apartment building early on Jan. 29, they haven’t yet seen footage of the attack itself, according to Fox News. Security footage has led them to two unidentified persons of interest, and Smollett said his attackers seemed to know who he was, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, a gay black actor-musician who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series “Empire,” spoke out for the first time this past Friday, three days after the alleged attack, as rumors swirled about the details of the incident.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he told Essence in a statement.

On Saturday, during a musical performance in West Hollywood, California, he got more specific. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,” he told the crowd. “I went to the doctor immediately. … I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. And above all, I fought the fuck back.”

Chicago police have said that Smollett is cooperating with the investigation and that there’s “no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Fox News reports."

Prior to the Jan. 31 attack, Smollett — who is openly gay and plays a gay character on “Empire” — told police that about a week earlier he received “hate mail at his place of work.”

The police report also notes that Smollett was initially reluctant to report the attack until another person convinced him to contact police.

No arrests have been made, with Chicago police collecting and reviewing surveillance video from the scene.

Leon W. Russell, Chairman of the NAACP National Board of Directors, will present Congresswoman Waters with the award at the 50 NAACP Image Awards on March 30, 2019 live at 9pm/8c on TV One.

“I am honored to present the Chairman’s Award to Congresswoman Waters, considered to be one of the most powerful women in American politics today and an inspiration to many,” said Mr. Russell. “Her 43 years of public service, first in the California State Assembly and then in the U.S. House of Representatives, have benefited countless Americans. As both a queen and a warrior, Congresswoman Waters has stood the test of time in her refusal to stand idle in the face of the relentless assaults on the humanity of African Americans and people of color. We salute her and her amazing legacy.”

Past honorees of the NAACP Chairman’s Award include William Lucy, Tyler Perry, Ruby Dee, The Neville Brothers, Bono, Danny Glover, Former Vice President Al Gore and Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai, then-Senator Barack Obama, Former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, TV One Founder and Chairman Cathy Hughes, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michele Howard, Brittany “Bree” Newsome, Justice League NYC, University of Missouri Concerned Student 1950 Collective, University of Mississippi NAACP College Chapter, Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley, Rev. Dr. Jamal Harrison Bryant, Jussie Smollett, and Dr. Charles J. Ogletree, Jr.

Throughout her many years of public service, Congresswoman Maxine Waters has been on the cutting edge, tackling difficult and often controversial issues. She has combined her strong legislative and public policy acumen and high visibility in Democratic Party activities with an unusual ability to do grassroots organizing.

Following the Los Angeles civil unrest in 1992, Congresswoman Waters faced the nation’s media and public to interpret the hopelessness and despair in cities across America. Over the years, she has brought many government officials and policy makers to her South-Central L.A. district to appeal for more resources.

She has used her skill to shape public policy and deliver the goods: $10 billion in Section 108 loan guarantees to cities for economic and infrastructure development, housing and small business expansion; $50 million appropriation for “Youth Fair Chance” program which established an intensive job and life skills training program for unskilled, unemployed youth; expanded U.S. debt relief for Africa and other developing nations; creating a “Center for Women Veterans,” among others.

She is a co-founder of Black Women’s Forum, a nonprofit organization of over 1,200 African American women in the Los Angeles area. In the mid-80s, she also founded Project Build, working with young people in Los Angeles housing developments on job training and placement.

As she confronts the issues such as poverty, economic development, equal justice under the law and other issues of concern to people of color, women, children, and poor people, Rep. Waters enjoys a broad cross section of support from diverse communities across the nation.

Throughout her career, Congresswoman Waters has been an advocate for international peace, justice, and human rights. Before her election to Congress, she was a leader in the movement to end Apartheid and establish democracy in South Africa. She opposed the 2004 Haitian coup d’etat, which overthrew the democratically-elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, and defends the rights of political prisoners in Haiti’s prisons. She leads congressional efforts to cancel the debts that poor countries in Africa and Latin America owe to wealthy institutions like the World Bank and free poor countries from the burden of international debts.

Expanding access to health care services is another of Congresswoman Waters’ priorities. She spearheaded the development of the Minority AIDS Initiative in 1998 to address the alarming spread of HIV/AIDS among African Americans, Hispanics and other minorities. Under her continuing leadership, funding for the Minority AIDS Initiative has increased from the initial appropriation of $156 million in fiscal year 1999 to approximately $400 million per year today. She is also the author of legislation to expand health services for patients with diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

She is lauded by African American entrepreneurs for her work to expand contracting and procurement opportunities and to strengthen businesses. Long active in the women’s movement, Rep. Waters has given encouragement and financial support to women seeking public office. Many young people, including those in the hip-hop music community, praise her for her support and understanding of young people and their efforts at self-expression. One testament to her work is the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center, a multimillion-dollar campus providing education and employment opportunities to residents of the Watts area.

As previously announced, the production team will be Executive Producers Reginald Hudlin and Phil Gurin, Tony McCuin as Director, Byron Phillips as Co-Executive Producer, Robin Reinhardt as Producer and Rachel Frimer as Executive in Charge of Production."

According to a Chicago Police Department report, the “Empire” star “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.” On Monday, Chicago’s ABC7 obtained a partially redacted copy of the report through a Freedom of Information Act request. Chilling new details have emerged as the report states two men wearing black, one in a ski mask, used their hands, feet, and teeth to harm the 36-year-old in the assault.

Police found Smollett with a white rope around his neck and stained clothes from a thrown unknown chemical substance. Smollett said it all started last Tuesday when he left a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The two attackers got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and then began to beat him “about the face with their hands”, per the report.

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,” according to the report. “The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,” it added.

The reports confirmed that Smollett informed police he received “hate mail at his place of work” a week before he was attacked. Although Chicago police have not been able to find the two men, they have located “additional security cameras” to help.

“Detectives continue to follow-up on investigative leads as additional security cameras have been located and footage is being downloaded and reviewed,” Guglielmi said. “The people of interest have not been identified (as homeless or otherwise),” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.

Smollett took the stage for the first time since the assault in California over the weekend.

“I’m not fully healed yet … but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all,” he told the cheering crowd.

The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett's request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet's neck.

""We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,"" Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he'd received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don't yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story. On Saturday, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the audience that if he did not perform his attackers would win."

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, the 36-year-old Empire actor was allegedly attacked in the early hours on January 29. After leaving a fast-food restaurant in Chicago, Smollett was reportedly approached by two men, who proceeded to physically attack him.

Smollett told authorities that the assailants put a rope around his neck, poured a chemical substance all over him – later reported to be bleach – and shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

As CNN detailed, a report released by the Chicago Police Department reveals that Smollett originally did not want to report the alleged attack.

The report – which was obtained by CNN through a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request – sheds more light on the alleged attack. The report includes details about the descriptions Smollett provided of his attacker’s clothing and appearance, as well as the aforementioned racist and homophobic slurs.

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features, and both offenders were dressed in black,” the report details.

Smollett recounted to police that the two unidentified males accosted him, and caught his attention by saying “Empire fa***t n***er.” Smollett, who is African-American, does portray a homosexual character on the show. Smollett himself also identifies as gay, and came out during a televised interview with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, back in March 2015.

Actor Jussie Smollett was initially hesitant to report an attack he allegedly suffered last week, according to a Chicago police report https://t.co/VORmZ4vn1U — CNN (@CNN) February 5, 2019

The police report also explains how Smollett was hesitant to report the attack. An unidentified 60-year-old-man contacted the authorities, telling police that Smollett “did not want to report [the] offense, however, he believed it to be in his best interest to.”

Jussie also told authorities that he had received hate mail a week prior to the accident, which had been delivered to his “place of work,” Cinespace Studios. The letter he received also came packaged with a mysterious white powder, which was later identified as aspirin.

Last week, Jussie made his first public appearance since the alleged attack. Smollett attended a concert held at the Troubadour club in West Hollywood. He performed at the concert and also spoke out about the alleged attacks.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” he said. “But I’m going to [be], and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

According to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, detectives working the case were able to locate a surveillance camera, which captured footage of potential suspects. At the time of writing, no one has been arrested or identified as Smollett’s attackers."

Although Jussie Smollett was the victim of an awful attack on his life, the Empire star almost decided not to come forward with his story.

This new information comes exactly one week since the apparent hate crime happened, per reports from ABC7 in Chicago.

According to the police incident report, the 35-year-old “did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to,” the friend who called police said. The doc continues, detailing the physical and verbal attack where two men allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at Jussie, just after getting his attention by mentioning Empire.

It was also reported that there was a noose found around the actor’s neck (still on him by the time he made contact with police), and he was covered in an unknown substance, which many say was bleach.

Ugh. We’re still so shocked and disgusted by the attack itself, and can see how it would almost be too traumatizing to talk about.

And considering the mixed support the black LGBTQ community has received in the past, it’s not impossible to think Smollett would have second thoughts about people believing him.

Either way, we’re glad the 35-year-old decided to go to the authorities because his story deserves to be told and not to mention, the assailants are still at large.

Thankfully, the police are getting closer to identifying at least one of the attackers. As we reported, Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi revealed that investigators have acquired surveillance footage of two men in the area of the alleged assault that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s attackers.

We truly hope the men responsible are caught, and that Jussie continues to stay strong.

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett told police that two men seemed to know who he was before they beat him, shouted racial and homophobic slurs, and looped a rope around his neck during an early-morning attack in Chicago, according to a recently released police report.

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

The report noted that the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn't want to report the attack, but that another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett's request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet's neck.

""We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,"" Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he'd received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don't yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story. On Saturday, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the audience that if he did not perform his attackers would win."

Jussie Smollett, an openly, gay Black man was recently physically attacked for the intersection of both these identities.

And somehow, comedian Jess Hilarious, in this cultural climate, made the decision to use the word f*ggot.

It really makes no sense, but I’ll try to explain anyway.

Taylor Gray threw a slight insult at comedian and Instagram influencer Jess Hilarious, saying:

“Imagine having to comment on TheShadeRoom 24/7 to keep the lights on.”

And this was Jess’s response.

Whew Chile.

On his part, Gray said he shared that comment because of mean-spirited things Jess directs at other people, particularly making fun of Demi Lovato’s addiction.

After the backlash started pouring in, Jess Hilarious issued this apology in the form of a video.

I’m not the most nit-picky person when it comes to apologies. But in this particular one, Jess spent way to much time attempting to rationalize her actions by describing what the man said to take her to this place of hatred. And it’s just not enough.

One, this man’s post was extremely mild and it baffles me that a homophobic slur was the first thing that came to her mind when this young man mentioned that she comments on The Shade Room, which is a true statement. The idea that she has to do so for money is not and certainly meant to be taken as an insult. But even if he’d repeatedly stalked and harassed her, she would have been better off coming up with something witty to shut him down or blocking him entirely than using a word that would alienate an entire community and their allies.

This action, in the year of our Lord 2019, is just not smart.

We, as a community and country, spent months talking about Kevin Hart’s homophobic jokes. We just witnessed the horrific incident actor Jussie Smollett endured for being Black and gay. And since Jess be all up in The Shade Room, I know she saw and heard about both of these stories. But she still didn’t choose to learn from them. It doesn’t make any sense as someone who just got off IG and was starting to make moves in the traditional, mainstream entertainment industry, working with Fox on the “Rel” show. And what’s truly tragic about this whole situation is that if she had put effort into making her clapback funny, witty and insulting without taking it too far, we would be celebrating her cleverness.

But here we are.

Lastly, this idea of saying she’s not homophobic after she used a homophobic slur at what seems her first opportunity, is ridiculous. If a Black person offended a White man and his immediate rebuttal was n*gger, we know he’s racist. And the same is true here. The use of someone’s sexuality as an insult is homophobic, sis.

At the end of the day, someone can only draw out what’s already there. And in this instance, it didn’t take much.

Smh.

Henson is continuing to support her Empire costar Jussie Smollett in the wake of the racist and homophobic attack against him last week.

Appearing at the New York City screening of her new comedy, What Men Want, Henson, who portrays Smollett’s onscreen mother in the popular FOX drama, once again opened up about the attack against her onscreen son, which left him hospitalized.

“He hasn’t been back [on set] yet, but he will be, absolutely. We miss him so...You can’t let hate win,” she told Entertainment Tonight. “At his very core is love, so that’s how he operates and that’s why the tragedy was felt by so many people because of what he represents.""

Smollett was attacked last week while leaving a Subway restaurant during the early morning hours in Chicago. The actor told authorities that two men approached him yelling homophobic and racial slurs and proceeded to physically assault him, pour what is believed to have been bleach on him, and tie a rope around his neck.

The attack, which the Chicago Police Department are investigating “as a possible hate crime,” left Smollett with lacerations to his face and neck, which required a brief hospitalization.

“I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now,"" Henson said just after news of the attack broke. “[Jussie Smollett] is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!!! I tell you one thing HATE WILL NOT WIN!!!! My baby is resilient and love still lives in him. The devil and his minions are very busy right now but one thing is for sure and two things are for certain #GODIS and that is all I know.""

While Smollett remained silent in the days directly following the attack, he broke his silence and spoke out against the crime on Friday, assuring fans he was okay.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” he said. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

He also spoke out against the attack, which he stated was not just a singular incident, but something that occurs to others every day.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” he said. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

No suspects have yet been charged in relation to the crime."

Jussie Smollett was initially reluctant to report that he had been attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, according to a Chicago Police Department report.

Smollett, the 36-year-old musician and actor who appears on “Empire,” told police he was accosted on the street at 2 a.m. Jan. 29. ABC7 in Chicago obtained a partially redacted copy of the report through a Freedom of Information Request on Monday.

According to the report, the officers were told that Smollett “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

The report states that police found Smollett with a white rope around his neck, and that he stated the attackers threw an unknown chemical substance on him, staining his clothes. Smollett said he was accosted by two men dressed in black, one of whom was wearing a ski mask. He did not remember any other details of the suspects.

Chicago police have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage in an effort to find the attackers, but have not found video of the attack. The department released an image of two “persons of interest” in the case Wednesday.

Eddie Johnson, superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, told reporters Friday that progress was being made.

“He is a victim and we treat him like a victim,” Johnson said. “He’s been very cooperative.”

Smollett performed Saturday at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, when he sought to clarify some details of the incident.

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately … I was not hospitalized,” he said on stage. “And above all: I fought the f— back.”"

The actor, who was attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs before allegedly putting his head in a noose, sustained mild injuries and bruising, the report states—and although at first he did not want to report the incident, he ultimately decided it would be in his best interest to speak with law enforcement.

CNN, which obtained the police document through a FOIA request, reports that Smollett did not recall any distinguishing features about his attackers, beyond the fact that they were dressed in black and wearing ski masks; he also could not remember the direction they ran in. He did, however, tell police that as the two approached him, they said, “Empire fa---t n---er.” He also told police that he had received hate mail at his place of work several days prior to the attack. Smollett reportedly received a letter at Fox Studios in Chicago that read, “You will die black f-g.”

Police have released images of two persons of interest in the case, amid an outpouring of support for Smollett from Hollywood and beyond. In a rare, raw moment on The Late Show, Ellen Page tearfully condemned the attack, as well as Vice President Mike Pence for his attitude toward L.G.B.T.Q. people. In a statement, Smollett’s family emphasized that what the actor endured was not an isolated incident. “Make no mistake,” his family wrote, “words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.”

In his first statement following the attack last week, Smollett wrote, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” He, too, stressed that his attack should not be viewed as a discrete event. On Saturday night, he performed for a sold-out audience at the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

“The hateful rhetoric that gets thrown around, I’m not gonna name names, it has to stop,” Smollett told the crowd. “But it stops with people who believe in love. Take love back because that’s all that we have . . . These last few days I couldn’t have gotten through without the love of my family and the love of y’all.”

DETROIT -- Two Detroit police officers have been suspended amid an investigation into racist comments and social media posts about a traffic stop.

Officer Gary Steele and an unidentified officer stopped 23-year-old Ariel Moore for driving with an expired license plate last week. They seized the vehicle, leaving Moore to walk a block home in the cold and dark.

WXYZ-TV reports that video posted to Steele's Snapchat account showed Moore, who is black, walking home as Steele says ""priceless"" and ""bye Felicia."" The caption tags read: ""What black girl magic looks like"" and ""celebrating Black History Month.""

Police Chief James Craig said Monday the officers have been suspended with pay. Craig earlier demoted Steele from corporal and apologized to Moore.

Police gathered surveillance video from the Chicago hotel and apartment building where Smollett lives, another nearby hotel and traffic cameras. The video is being downloaded and reviewed.

[irp posts=”6133″ name=”Jussie Smollett Releases First Statement About Chicago Attack”]

A Chicago police official who has viewed the tapes said there is video footage of Smollett entering the apartment building after the alleged attack with what appears to be a noose around his neck.

An initial incident report, released by the Chicago Police Department on Monday, revealed that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor “did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

Once they arrived, responding officers said they found Smollett at his home with stained clothing and “white rope draped around” his neck, according to the report, which ABC News obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.

Smollett said the attack happened last Tuesday at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him “about the face with their hands,” the report said.

[irp posts=”6041″ name=”Police Release Photos Of ‘Persons Of Interest’ In Jussie Smollett Attack”]

They used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to the report.

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,” according to the report. “The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,” it added.

Although Smollett was unable to identify his alleged attackers, he did provide officers with an approximate height and weight for one of the assailants.

The incident report goes on to detail what the 36-year-old actor and singer told officers about the alleged assault, including information about a noose being placed around his neck and an unknown chemical, possibly bleach, being poured on him.

The report also confirmed that Smollett told police that he received “hate mail at his place of work” on Jan. 22, a week before the alleged attack took place.

Smollett appeared at a planned performance on Saturday night in Hollywood just days after the incident, telling the crowd, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win.”"

The report detailed that the pair of attackers used not only their hands and feet but also their teeth to beat up the 36-year-old, who was eventually taken to the hospital and treated for several lacerations to his face. The two men were fully dressed in black, with one of them also wearing a mask, in the evening of last Tuesday. They jumped on the Empire star as he was walking back to his apartment, but because of the black mask that concealed “any facial features,” Smollett could not provide “any other distinguishing features of the offenders,” as per the Daily Mail. However, the actor, who plays a gay musician on the hit show, did tell police officers that one of the assailants was between 5-foot-10 and 6-foot-1 and weighed around 170 pounds.

The police report also states that it was a friend of the victim who decided to call the authorities, as Smollett didn’t want to report the attack. When officers found him, he still had “white rope draped around” his neck and wore “stained clothing,” which was “soaked in an unknown substance” that has been widely reported as bleach. The brutal beating happened on Tuesday, January 29, at around 2 a.m. after the actor-singer exited a Subway restaurant and made his way to his Chicago apartment.

Footage from CCTV cameras captured the moment Smollett walked down a street while the two attackers sat on a bench facing him before they both stood up and walked away, with the three eventually walking out of the cameras’ view. The Hollywood star told police that the assailants yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him “about the face with their hands.” Another camera near his apartment building later showed him entering the house with the rope still around his neck and his clothes dirty.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s manager, said he was on the phone with the actor at the time and that he heard the attackers shouting “this is MAGA country!” It has also been confirmed that Smollett had received homophobic hate mail just a week before the crime, but that he refused to have 24/7 security with him. The hate mail was reportedly sent to the Empire filming studio, with staff being horrified upon finding the letters."

TRUMP TO CALL FOR UNITY - DURING A STATE OF DISUNITY: During his State of the Union address tonight, President Trump is expected to take on a role his fiercest critics say he is most unfamiliar with: Uniter-in-Chief. And Trump is expected to call for unity and stress optimism when he addresses Congress and the nation during his second State of the Union address ... But given the bitter partisan battle with Democrats, especially House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, over the border wall and another looming government shutdown, the question is whether Democrats will be receptive -- or at least give the appearance of decorum.

Will they applaud or will they sit on their hands. What will Pelosi's expression be, as a nation observes her, in the background, over Trump's left shoulder, when he condemns ""resistance and retribution politics"" and makes his argument for strong border security via his wall? This is the drama that faces President Trump's State of the Union address.

Some Democrats, with their selection of State of the Union guests, have already signaled that reconciliation will not be on their agenda. In addition, the president is expected to showcase a growing economy. Despite the shutdown, the U.S. economy added a robust 304,000 jobs in January, marking 100 straight months of job growth. Trump and his top aides have also hinted that he is likely to use the address to announce a major milestone in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria.

DEMS FACE DILEMMA IN VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S SCANDAL: Democrats are demonstrating hypocrisy with their refusal to forgive Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for a racist photo that appeared on his medical school yearbook page more than 30 years ago, a liberal journalist says ... “People change dramatically over time,” Zaid Jilani said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Monday, adding that liberals “are undermining their philosophy.”Jilani, who wrote an op-ed entitled ""Why does Ralph Northam deserve no mercy?"" called Democratic leaders “unprincipled” for pushing criminal prison reform while trying to bring down prominent individuals who've made mistakes.

Northam has refused leading Democrats' calls to resign. Northam initially apologized but insisted he was not the person in the photo. Still, critics argue, the Democratic Party may have no choice but to have a zero tolerance policy on Northam. A party that peddles identity politics can't attack President Trump and others for alleged racism if they don't police their own.

The turmoil surrounding Northam grew more bizarre Monday when it became entangled with a scandal following Virginia Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax. In response to a reporter's question, Fairfax suggested Northam could be secretly pushing a newly revealed sexual assault allegation against him to derail his possible ascension to the governorship.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL COMMITTEE SUBPOENAED: Federal prosecutors in New York Monday issued a subpoena to President Trump's inaugural committee, a spokesperson for the committee confirmed to Fox News, a move that threatened to open another front against an administration dogged by investigations ...

""We have just received a subpoena for documents,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""While we are still reviewing the subpoena, it is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry.""

The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which revealed that prosecutors had asked for ""all documents"" related to the committee's donors and vendors, as well as records relating to ""benefits"" that donors received after making contributions. They also requested documents relating to donations ""made by or on behalf of foreign nationals, including but not limited to any communications regarding or relating to the possibility of donations by foreign nationals.""

He added that two individuals seen in the area around the time Smollett said he was attacked -- and considered ""people of interest"" -- had not yet been identified ""as homeless or otherwise."" Guglielmi previously said investigators would go painstakingly through footage to reconstruct what Smollett said happened to him early on the morning of Jan. 29.

WHY REPUBLICANS SHOULD AVOID LIBERAL 'PC PURITANS'- ""Everybody is walking on eggshells everywhere to avoid being called out for white privilege or gender privilege, without the privilege of knowing what this new orthodoxy even requires.

Because the Democrats, they’re tripping all over themselves to prove how enlightened they are by throwing even their own under the PC express."" – Laura Ingraham, on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" warning Republicans to avoid Democrats' rush to condemn Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for his alleged appearance in a racist photo in his 1984 medical yearbook and stick to focusing on Dems' very questionable policies. WATCH

He did not want to involve authorities

Jussie Smollett did not tell police in his first interview that his attackers yelled 'this is MAGA country' before jumping him, the original police report has revealed, and did not want to involve the authorities.

The 36-year-old actor was walking home from Subway to his apartment when he was jumped by two men who were dressed entirely in black, the report, which DailyMail.com obtained a copy of on Tuesday, reveals.

They got his attention by calling him 'Empire f****t n*****' then battered him 'about the face' and 'poured an unknown chemical substance on him.'

One of the men, described as a 'primary aggressor' was wearing a black mask, he told the cops.

Smollett's manager, Brandon Z. Moore, previously said that he was on the phone to him when the incident happened and that he heard the attackers shouting 'This is MAGA country!'.

Smollett told the police that detail in a follow-up the next day. He also declined to give his phone to police for them to verify that he and his manager were on a call when the attack took place.

The actor was left bruised and with minor injuries. After being beaten, Smollett returned to his apartment, keeping a white rope around his neck which he told the police the pair had put on him.

Forty minutes later, officers arrived at the apartment at the request of a 60-year-old man.

The 200lb man, who was previously described to DailyMail.com as an 'associate' of the actor, insisted that they call the authorities. He and one other person who was also in the apartment greeted officers in Smollett's apartment building lobby.

The report reveals that Smollett was found with minor injuries when police arrived at his apartment

These are of two people of interest who were in area at the time of the attack but police have not been able to identify them or even determine if they are homeless

They told the cops that Smollett did not want to report the incident but that they told him it was 'in his best interest to.'

Police found Smollett in his apartment with a white rope 'draped around his neck.'

It is not clear if the associate, who has not been named, was inside his apartment already when he returned or if he called him to come round after returning home.

Police have also recently found footage taken on additional security cameras which they hope may reveal who the attackers are.

They were in the process of downloading that footage on Monday night and have still not come any closer to identifying two men whose images they previously released and described as 'persons of interest.'

Smollett performed to a sold-out show at the Troubador in Los Angeles on Saturday night (shown)

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, containing a racist and homophobic threat. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

They have not even be able to determine whether the men are homeless.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S STATEMENT ON RACIST HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ” As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. 'Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor…Jussie. Advertisement

The attack took place on January 29 at around 2am, soon after Smollett had left a Subway restaurant and was heading back towards his apartment.

He was picked back up by a different camera later as he entered his apartment building with the rope around his neck and salt from the ground on his sweatshirt.

The police report also confirms that Smollett told authorities he received homophobic hate mail in the a week prior to the alleged hate crime.

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

President Trump has condemned the attack as 'horrible'.

'That I can tell you is horrible. I've seen it ... last night. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned,' the President said.

Smollett played a sold-out show at the famous Troubador in Los Angeles over the weekend, but cancelled a follow-up a meet-and-greet session because of the incident.

Addressing the incident to huge crowds on Saturday, he said: 'I'm not fully healed yet... but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.'

'I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those [expletive] win,' he said, adding that his family and friends had wanted him to cancel the entire performance.

'Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me.'"

Empire star Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined over the weekend at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

“The most important thing I can say is, ‘Thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago last Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

“I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.”

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn’t do that.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those (expletives) win,” he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on towards the end of his set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

Bruised

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

“And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,” he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically, but with a laugh, “I’m the gay Tupac.”

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked that he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did.

“It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.”

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck. Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson inEmpire, the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season.

The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album,Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs fromEmpire.

He often sits at the piano on the show, but stood front and centre at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

“To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr said. “But we realised this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing.

“He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.”"

Jussie Smollett took some convincing to report the alleged violent attack he faced one week ago.

The Chicago Police report from the night of the incident suggests that the Empire actor was hesitant to make a statement but believed it was ‘in his best interests’.

It seems that a friend called the police when Jussie admitted himself to hospital in the early hours of last Tuesday. It was then that he decided to report the incident.

The official report was obtained by ABC7 News on Monday under a Freedom of Information request and describes the account that Jussie gave on the night of the attack.

It details how attackers, concealed by black clothing and face masks, used their hands to beat the actor before throwing liquid and putting a rope around his neck.

Jussie was on the phone to his music manager Brandon Z. Moore when he was attacked by two men on the 300-block of East North Water Street around 2 am on Tuesday 29 January.

On Friday, the TV actor said he was concerned about inaccuracies in how the story has been repeated.

In a statement, he said: ‘I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.

‘Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.’

The actor went on to make his first public appearance since the attack on Saturday night.

Taking the stage to address the crowd, Smollett said: ‘The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to.

‘And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.’

Taraji P. Henson says Jussie Smollett is bouncing back from the apparent hate crime that sent him the hospital on Tuesday, January 29.

“He’s resilient,” Henson, 48, said of her Empire costar, 36, on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Monday, February 4. “When your very fiber is love and that’s all you know … You know what I mean? That’s just who he is. He’s just very resilient. Very resilient. That’s my baby.”

After cohost Kelly Ripa said that everyone at Live loves Smollett, Henson replied, “What’s not to love? And I think what was overwhelming for him was the overwhelming response from everybody. It’s like, everybody was sending him love. And I think that’s important because that was traumatic.”

The What Men Want actress also opened up about the crime during her Monday appearance on Today. “I just told him to walk in his truth, just stay the Jussie that everybody loves,” she recalled. “And you saw the outpour of love that he had, so he has touched a lot of people, in his career. So, I just told him, ‘Just walk in your truth, baby. No one can take that from you.’”

Smollett was attacked in a “possible hate crime” in Chicago on Tuesday, Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to Us Weekly. The actor was approached by two people “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs toward him” who then “began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim” and “wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck,” Guglielmi added.

The “Hurt People” singer released his first statement since the attack on Friday, February 1, the same day that police said they were “making gains” in the investigation of the attack. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger,” Smollett said. “More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

The following day, Smollett performed an emotional concert at West Hollywood’s Troubadour venue. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let [them] win,” he told the audience. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”"

Smollett told police he and the show’s executive producer used gloves to open the envelope. Inside was a sheet of white paper with a threat in cut-out letters: “You will die black fag.” There was white powder in the envelope, but it was later determined to be crushed acetaminophen, a pain reliever found in Tylenol, police said.

Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter. It was postmarked in southwest suburban Bedford Park on Jan. 18, four days earlier, and bore two American flag stamps. The letters MAGA were written, also in red ink, in the upper-left corner of the envelope.

A week later, Smollett — who is black and openly gay — said he had just left a Subway shop in the Streeterville neighborhood on the Near North Side and was walking to his apartment when two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a rope around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

A chemical — maybe bleach — was poured on him, police said.

Police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are related, and so far they are being investigated separately: the letter by the FBI and the alleged attack by Chicago police.

No progress has been reported on the letter and very little on the reported attack. Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Friday that detectives were “making gains” and he hoped there would a “successful resolution soon.” He offered no details.

Detectives have checked more than a dozen cameras in the Streeterville area but had yet to find any footage of an attack. They have been able to track stretches of Smollett’s walk between the Subway shop and his apartment building and have spotted two other people in the area at the time. But the images are dark and blurry.

Investigators are now reviewing security footage from a hotel near Smollett’s apartment they hope may have images of the attack, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. He cautioned it could take days to review the hours of videos.

Smollett has told police he was on the phone the time with his music manager, who says he heard the slurs and a scuffle. But both of them have so far declined to hand over their cellphones to detectives.

Despite skepticism voiced on social media, Johnson said police “have no reason to believe (Smollett’s) not being genuine with us.”

“Empire,” which premiered on the Fox network in 2015, is a musical drama that films in Chicago for most of the year. The series stars Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson and Bryshere Gray. Smollett plays a gay musician.

Monday morning, Henson was asked about Smollett while appearing on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” to promote her new film, “What Men Want.”

“You know, he’s resilient,” she said. “You know, when your very fiber is love, and that’s all you know. … You know what I mean? That’s just who he is, so he’s very resilient. Very resilient. That’s my baby. … Everybody was sending him love. And I think, you know, that’s important because you know that was traumatic.”"

5am – A/B/C EMBATTLED VIRGINIA GOVERNOR UNDER PRESSURE:

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam reportedly met with top aides Sunday night amid a growing chorus of Democrats calling on him to resign amid the uproar over his alleged appearance in a medical yearbook photo showing one man dressed in blackface and another in a KKK robe … The Democratic governor so far has refused to resign. He initially apologized but then denied being in the actual photo. Still, Democrats are concerned the controversy surrounding Northam could provide a distraction as they prepare for the 2020 presidential election and are skeptical that he can continue to effectively lead.

Northam calls Sunday night staff meeting as he considers resignation – The Washington Post. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called an unscheduled senior staff meeting Sunday night just before the start of the Super Bowl, as the governor considered resigning after two days of defiance amid a controversy over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook. People familiar with the meeting said the governor had not reached a decision. It was unclear who was present, but the group included senior staffers of color. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), who would become governor if Northam resigned, was not there, the people said. Calling the Sunday night meeting was a clear signal of Northam’s effort to weigh support within the administration as he evaluates his options. Although he pledged on Saturday to stand his ground, he also said he would reconsider if he thought he could no longer be effective. Just a day later, resignation is an active consideration, the people said. The meeting was emotional, according to a Democratic official. Northam scheduled a larger meeting for Monday morning for administration staff, the official said.

Northam scheduled a larger meeting for Monday morning for administration staff, the official said. CALLS FOR NORTHAM TO RESIGN Holder: Northam Should Resign, Discussion Needed About Racist Symbols. Former Attorney General Eric Holder called for Gov. Raph Northam (D-VA) to resign over an unearthed photo with racist imagery, and he said a nationwide discussion about modern-day racism is needed in America. “I have come to know Ralph Northam as a good, very decent man,” Holder’s statement shared to Twitter began. “I regretfully conclude that he does not now have the ability to effectively govern and effectively stand for the issues – moral and political – that Virginia and the nation must confront. The Governor should resign.” Holder then went on to say that while Northam’s resignation would be “correct,” it would not put an end to the matter. “We still need to have a difficult and necessary conversation about how racism and racist symbols still pervade too much of our society – and the pain they cause,” Holder said. Northam loses Doug Wilder, the former VA governor – and first African American governor in the country – who was giving him deference this morning: L. Douglas Wilder ‏ @GovernorWilder: I stated, earlier, that Gov. Northam’s continuing in office was his choice to make. It is difficult for anyone who watched the press conference today to conclude that he has any other choice … but to resign. VA Del. Kathy Tran on Facebook: I stand with my friends in the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and Virginia House Democrats in calling for Governor Northam to resign. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‏@AOC Feb 2: Northam must resign, and those who try to help him stumble past this deserve scrutiny. If you can’t understand how painful + eroding this is to American society, let alone the state of Virginia, take some time to read up this weekend. To start, try “Between the World and Me.” 2020 candidates, NAACP call for Northam’s resignation. Julian Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris, who have both announced they are running for president in 2020, denounced their fellow Democrat on Twitter and called for his resignation. President of NAACP calls for the resignation of Governor Ralph Northam: Derrick Johnson ‏@DerrickNAACP Black face in any manner is always racist and never okay. No matter the party affiliation, we can not stand for such behavior, which is why the @NAACP is calling for the resignation of Virginia Governor @RalphNortham 4:17 PM – 1 Feb 2019 Former Virginia governor McAuliffe predicts Northam will resign after racist yearbook photo.

I have no idea what was going on in the governor’s office on Friday.” Pelosi calls for resignation after reports that Northam is now saying he isn’t sure it’s him in the photo JOE BIDEN: There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now. CORY BOOKER: These images arouse centuries of anger, anguish, and racist violence and they’ve eroded all confidence in Gov. Northam’s ability to lead. We should expect more from our elected officials. He should resign COMEY: Governor Northam should resign. Our Commonwealth is better than this and deserves better than this. Elizabeth Warren says Northam should resign: “These racist images are deeply disturbing. Hatred and discrimination have no place in our country and must not be tolerated, especially from our leaders— Republican or Democrat. Northam must resign



5am – D Insider leaks Trump’s “Executive Time”-filled private schedules (Axios) — A White House source has leaked nearly every day of President Trump’s private schedule for the past three months. Why it matters: This unusually voluminous leak gives us unprecedented visibility into how this president spends his days. The schedules, which cover nearly every working day since the midterms, show that Trump has spent around 60% of his scheduled time over the past 3 months in unstructured “Executive Time.” We’ve published every page of the leaked schedules in a piece that accompanies this item. To protect our source, we retyped the schedules in the same format that West Wing staff receives them. What the schedules show: Trump, an early riser, usually spends the first 5 hours of the day in Executive Time. Each day’s schedule places Trump in “Location: Oval Office” from 8 to 11 a.m. But Trump, who often wakes before 6 a.m., is never in the Oval during those hours, according to six sources with direct knowledge. Instead, he spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers. Trump’s first meeting of the day — usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. — is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff. Since Nov. 7, the day after the midterm elections, Trump has spent around 297 hours in Executive Time, according to the 51 private schedules we’ve obtained. For those same schedules, Trump has had about 77 hours scheduled for meetings that include policy planning, legislative strategy and video recordings. Some days, Executive Time totally predominates. For instance, he had 1 hour of scheduled meetings on Jan. 18 (with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin) and 7 hours of Executive Time. The day after the midterms, Trump’s schedule had 30 minutes for a chief of staff meeting and more than 7 hours for Executive Time. Former chief of staff John Kelly introduced the concept of Executive Time because the president hated being locked into a regular schedule.

6am – E Democrat Elizabeth Warren apologizes to Cherokee Nation for DNA test. WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has apologized to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test in a widely criticized effort to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, the tribe said on Friday. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, called Bill John Baker, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, on Thursday to apologize for taking the DNA test last year, said Julie Hubbard, a Cherokee Nation spokeswoman. “It was a brief and private conversation but I understand that she did apologize for causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted,” Hubbard said in a statement. The chief and other tribal leaders appreciate that Warren “reaffirmed she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen – or a citizen of any tribal nation,” Hubbard said.

PENTAGON ANNOUNCES MORE TROOPS TO BORDER: The Pentagon announced Sunday the deployment of 3,750 more active-duty troops to the U.S. border with Mexico. The deployment will raise the total active duty forces to approximately 4,350.

The deployment will raise the total active duty forces to approximately 4,350. 2 MEMBERS OF THE BI-PARTISAN IMMIGRATION COMMITTEE TALK DIFFERENCES: Speaking exclusively to “Fox News Sunday,” a top Democrat on the bipartisan congressional committee negotiating a border security compromise indicated that his party would support “some sort of enhanced barrier” — but not a “wall” like the one President Trump has demanded. The government is currently funded through Feb. 15, and the committee is racing to reach an agreement to avert the possibility of another partial federal government shutdown over funding for a border wall. Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar insisted that local officials, instead of the head of the Border Patrol and other federal officers who have called for a wall, should make the final determination on what construction is necessary.





7am – A Tran Cancels Town Hall After Pro-Lifers Organize Rally Protesting Virginia Abortion Bill. (Washington Free Beacon) – LORTON, Virginia—State Del. Kathy Tran (D.) canceled a Saturday town hall in her local district, citing “security concerns,” but a pro-life rally protesting Tran’s abortion proposal took place there as planned. This week Tran presented a bill to drastically reduce Virginia’s state regulations on abortion but quickly drew backlash when she said the bill would allow abortions as late as the day of delivery. The bill went down in the House of Delegates and two days later she claimed she “misspoke” about legalizing abortions on the day of delivery, but pro-life Virginians turned the bill and its support among Democrats into a rallying cry. One of the Democrats who supported Tran, Gov. Ralph Northam, inadvertently gave pro-lifers a slogan when he tried to defend the bill by seeming to endorse infanticide by saying some babies born alive could be subject to a “discussion” about whether they will live. “Resist Infanticide” was printed on signs distributed by the lead organizer, Susan B. Anthony List.

“Delegate Tran, Governor Northam, [New York Gov. Andrew] Cuomo—any legislator in this nation that is considering allowing abortion up until birth, until labor, and infanticide itself, here’s one thing we want you to know: If you seek to build women’s rights on the broken bodies of America’s children, you will fail,” said Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.

In Washington Post interview CHRISTIE Says Booker Could Have What It Takes… “He was someone who was pro-voucher, he was pro-charter school, he was somebody who was tough on crime in the city of Newark. If he stays in that lane, and is the articulate, inspirational guy that he is, then I think he’s got a legitimate chance to” beat Trump

“I know him. I don’t think he has a chance,” President Trump on Sen. Cory Booker’s 2020 bid

ON CNN: Terry McAuliffe on 2020 run for president: “I’ve said I’d make a decision by March 31st. I have been talking to other candidates. I want to see what the positions are out there. I am going through the process… I’d like to do it.”

Kamala Harris learns the perils of presidential front-running (San Francisco Chronicle column by Willie Brown, published Feb 2) – “And I must admit, I was no help to Harris on the national front. “Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” I thought that little item would put the issue to rest. Not quite. Six months ago, it would have been just a chuckle among us locals. Harris’ emergence at the front of the presidential pack turned it into something that pundits from here to the Beltway parsed from every angle. Did I say that besides me helping her, she helped me? I honestly don’t think I would have made it through my first grueling run for mayor without her smarts and support. She loved me, and I loved me. It was a perfect relationship.”

7am – D Northam calls Sunday night staff meeting as he considers resignation – The Washington Post. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called an unscheduled senior staff meeting Sunday night just before the start of the Super Bowl, as the governor considered resigning after two days of defiance amid a controversy over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook. People familiar with the meeting said the governor had not reached a decision. It was unclear who was present, but the group included senior staffers of color. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), who would become governor if Northam resigned, was not there, the people said. Calling the Sunday night meeting was a clear signal of Northam’s effort to weigh support within the administration as he evaluates his options. Although he pledged on Saturday to stand his ground, he also said he would reconsider if he thought he could no longer be effective. Just a day later, resignation is an active consideration, the people said. The meeting was emotional, according to a Democratic official. Northam scheduled a larger meeting for Monday morning for administration staff, the official said.

7am – E *”Empire” actor and musician Jussie Smollett managed to KEEP HIS SANDWICH! Jussie Smollett, the gay black actor who appears on the TV show Empire, wants the world to know he’s okay. He did a concert last night during which he addressed the alleged hate-crime assault he suffered early Tuesday morning near a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. Smollett has previously said he was talking to his manager on his cellphone during the attack and still had that phone after the attack. Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel of Fox32 News tweeted that police sources had confirmed that Smollett also still had the Subway sandwich on him when he turned up at an apartment building shortly after the alleged attack. So Smollett underwent a vicious beating by two attackers that apparently lasted less than 60 seconds, since that is the reported gap in surveillance footage between an image of him without a rope around his neck and an image of him with the rope. Smollett now says he fought back, but apparently he lost neither his Subway sandwich nor his cell phone in this brawl. Also he didn’t immediately call the police on that phone to describe the suspects and inform the police which way they had gone when they suddenly ran away from him, but instead waited about 40 minutes to inform the police.

Harrowing details emerged in the Jussie Smollett case on Monday, nearly a week after the ""Empire"" actor told police that he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a possible hate crime in Chicago.

An initial incident report, released by the Chicago Police Department on Monday, revealed that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""

Once they arrived, responding officers said they found Smollett at his home with stained clothing and ""white rope draped around"" his neck, according to the report, which ABC News obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.

Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox's ""Empire,"" said the attack happened last Tuesday at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said.

They used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to the report.

""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.

Although Smollett was unable to identify his alleged attackers, he did provide officers with an approximate height and weight for one of the assailants.

The incident report goes on to detail what the 36-year-old actor and singer told officers about the alleged assault, including information about a noose being placed around his neck and an unknown chemical, possibly bleach, being poured on him.

The report also confirmed that Smollett told police that he received ""hate mail at his place of work"" on Jan. 22, a week before the alleged attack took place.

The report surfaced just hours after Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that investigators located ""additional security cameras"" that could help with the manhunt for suspects.

""Detectives continue to follow-up on investigative leads as additional security cameras have been located and footage is being downloaded and reviewed,"" Guglielmi said. ""The people of interest have not been identified (as homeless or otherwise).""

Smollett returned to the stage for the first time since reporting the attack at a performance in California over the weekend.

""I'm not fully healed yet ... but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,"" he told the cheering crowd.

He said his family and friends had urged him to cancel the performance, which was scheduled before the alleged incident, but he declined.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those [expletive] win,"" he said. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me."""
78,https://duclarion.com/2019/02/ellen-degeneres-the-untouchable-celebrity/,,Ellen DeGeneres: The “untouchable” celebrity – DU Clarion,['Emma Cohen'],,"['ellen', 'know', 'untouchable', 'hart', 'celebrity', 'im', 'homophobic', 'thats', 'du', 'love', 'degeneres', 'clarion', 'queer', 'black', 'shes']","You’ll be hard-pressed to find someone who dislikes Ellen DeGeneres. Her daytime talk show has been a constant source of laughter, joy and positivity for millions worldwide since 2003. Her first comedy special in over fifteen years, “Relatable,” tried to prove that even after she’s found massive success in rebuilding her career after she came out as gay, she’s still “just like us.”

In the special, DeGeneres noted one particularly un-relatable thing: her self-created image, hinged upon her show’s sign-off “be kind to one another,” doesn’t give her much room to do the opposite. She says, “I can never do anything unkind, ever now, ever. I’m the ‘be kind’ girl. And I’m kind, I’m a good person, I know I am, but I’m a human being and I have bad days.”

It’s no secret that celebrity status can be painfully restrictive on one’s life, despite the usual success that’s attached to it. I can sympathize with DeGeneres’s frustration over the fact that she can’t do something as simple as honking at someone while driving without the fear of making headlines. But in January, when she protected and forgave Kevin Hart, it became clear that she pushes back against such restraints to a fault.

On Dec. 4, Kevin Hart announced he’d be hosting the 91st Academy Awards, an honor he said “would be the opportunity of a lifetime… a goal on [his] list for a long time.” Immediately after his announcement, Hart faced immense backlash after numerous homophobic tweets, mostly from 2009-2011, resurfaced with many people demanding he step down as host.

In these tweets (which he finally started to delete), Hart used multiple homophobic slurs and fed into the toxic masculinity from which most homophobic comments towards gay men stem. One tweet from 2011 read, “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.’”

Soon after the tweets were exposed, Hart posted a non-apologetic video on Instagram, the caption stating, “Stop looking for reasons to be negative… Stop searching for reasons to be angry… I LOVE EVERYBODY…..ONCE AGAIN EVERYBODY. If you choose to not believe me then that’s on you.”

He dug in his heels even deeper in a later video, making it clear that he refused to apologize for his homophobia; instead, he claimed he had already apologized multiple times before, but the closest thing to an apology anyone could find was this statement from 2015: “I wouldn’t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren’t as sensitive as they are now.” There is no indication that Hart is no longer homophobic, despite his insistence that he “loves everybody.”

Not long after he posted the second video, he stepped down as host and apologized on Twitter. But he should have simply apologized without hesitation and truly proven that he has changed (which he’s had the last ten or so years to do).

Then, a month later, DeGeneres had Hart on her show in a PR stunt that proved he has no true grasp on why he should be held accountable for his actions, and DeGeneres proved that she doesn’t either. They were both too focused on repairing Hart’s tarnished reputation to worry about the hurt he caused black queer people; they exercised the relative privilege both of them have compared to black queer people without acknowledging it, all in the name of increasing said privilege.

Hart couldn’t even wait for DeGeneres’s prompting to talk about the Oscar controversy. He spoke about his character in his most recent film, a “guy that was incarcerated, and wants a second-chance life but he can’t get it, because society holds him back based on the mistake that he made.” Can you see where he’s going with this?

Yes: he’s comparing the backlash he received over his blatant homophobia to the systematic oppression of black people who have been subjected to mass incarceration in this country, saying, “It’s crazy because it coincides with my life now. You know, he’s still being held accountable for a mistake that he made when he’s trying to do the right thing, and nobody will let him move forward.”

When the two finally address the controversy directly, Hart is only concerned with the fact that he got his “moment” taken away from him, “not even a full 24 hours to glow in the glory of ‘Kevin Hart is hosting this year’s Oscars.’” He claims he doesn’t have “a homophobic bone in [his] body.” I really do have to give him credit because I have never seen somebody so steadfastly dismissive while simultaneously claiming to take responsibility for his actions: “I don’t know the perfect individual society is now looking for. It’s not me.”

But DeGeneres and Hart are friends, so he gets a free pass. That’s just how things work, I guess. DeGeneres revealed she called the Academy, advocating for Hart’s position as host to be restored. DeGeneres encouraged him to ignore the backlash, saying, “There are so many haters out there. Whatever’s going on on the internet, don’t pay attention to them. That’s a small group of people being very very loud.” She motions to the audience, “We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.”

DeGeneres’s reaction is disappointing, but not surprising. Though it cannot be denied that she made massive strides for LGBT+ people everywhere after deciding to come out, temporarily moving her career to a halt, she does not have the right to speak for all LGBT+ people. DeGeneres represents a “white, wealthy, desexualized, monogamous… neutered and relatively nonthreatening” image of the LGBT+ community. She can never know what it is like to be a black queer person, as she has lived a life insulated with more privilege than any black queer person could access.

As George Johnson, a black queer author, journalist and activist, puts it, “She[’s] basically forgiving Hart on behalf of people she doesn’t speak for, she is also using her power get him to the highest levels of the industry. She has created a situation where her whiteness will not only protect Hart but continue to give no recourse to the black queer community when we express our hurt.”

The “internet trolls” she and Hart so readily discounted were the voices of black queer people and others who know how to be good allies. In having Hart on her show, she normalized the kind of mindset that, in part, led to the hate crime perpetrated against Jussie Smollett.

Smollett, star of “Empire”, was attacked on Jan. 29 in Chicago by two individuals “who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown ‘chemical substance’ on [him] and wrapped a rope around his neck,” a flagrant act of racism and homophobia.

Both DeGeneres and Hart commented on the attack; Hart said in an Instagram post, “Sending prayers your way @jussiesmollett …. WTF is going on the world???? Why are we falling in love with hate???? God damn it people….Choose love…I repeat…Choose love. I will forever choose love and I will continue to teach my kids how to do the same. Stand strong brother.” I can only assume that he figured it would smooth over the Oscars controversy; Hart needs to understand that he cannot control who accepts his apology, and DeGeneres needs to know when it’s her place to accept someone’s apology.

DeGeneres tweeted, “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.” She’s giving herself credit where it certainly is not due. She paved the way for white, easy-to-embrace queer people 20 years ago, when queer people of color were barely a part of the conversation.

It is time for us to destroy the concept of untouchability when it comes to celebrities. Yes, Ellen has to think twice before she honks her car horn. But she’s gotten away with murder. So has Kevin Hart. For her, the injustice of “a celebrity being unfairly criticized” far surpassed the injustice of the bigoted humor Kevin Hart spewed in the past. Their wrongdoings need to be a part of a bigger conversation to demand accountability for individuals in a position of power across many different professions (actors, comedians, politicians, etc.). But I don’t expect anything of the sort to happen anytime soon."

Smollett told police that he was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two men who placed a rope around his neck and beat him with their fists. He also alleged that the two men, who he said were wearing masks, poured a chemical on him, according to ABC 7 Chicago.

In a later interview, Smollett said the men shouted ""MAGA country"" during the attack.

Police last week released surveillance footage of “potential persons of interest” in the incident. The actor said in a statement Friday that he has been ""100% truthful"" with law enforcement authorities about the alleged attack.

The statement came after police said he refused to turn over his cell phone.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Twitter on Monday that detectives are continuing to ""follow up on investigative leads"" and review additional surveillance footage.

The alleged assault continues to be investigated as a possible hate crime.

Smollett appeared at a planned performance on Saturday night in Hollywood just days after the incident, telling the crowd, “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherf---ers win."""

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features, and both offenders were dressed in black,” the report said.

Smollett did not recall any other distinguishing features or the direction the attackers fled in, the report said.

He suffered minor injuries and bruising, the report said. Smollett was sober at the time, according to the report.

Smollett told police he had received “hate mail at his place of work” on January 22, several days before the alleged attack, according to the report.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN last week that the letter Smollett received on January 22 at Cinespace Studios, where the show is filmed, prompted a response from the HAZMAT unit.

Authorities determined that a white powder accompanying the letter was aspirin, Guglielmi said last week, declining to provide details on the letter’s contents.

The police report did not offer additional details on the letter.

The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the letter, declined to comment Monday through FBI Chicago spokesman Special Agent John W. Althen.

A spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Entertainment, which produces the series, had declined to comment last week when reached by CNN.

Smollett’s family released a statement last week supporting the actor and condemning the attack, calling it a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

In his first show since the reported attack, Smollett tearfully told fans on Saturday he wasn’t fully healed but was doing okay.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all, I couldn’t let those (expletives) … win,” he said at West Hollywood’s Troubadour club, referring to his attackers. “Above all I fought … (expletive) back.”

Chicago police released photos last week of people they would like to talk to for their investigation, but no one has been arrested in the alleged attack.

Police are following up on leads and still reviewing footage, according to Guglielmi."

Star power: Her new movie What Men Want opens in theatres on Friday. And on Monday, Taraji P. Henson promoted the big screen comedy at a special screening in New York City

The film directed by Adam Shankman is set in the world of sports agents and is inspired by the 2000 film What Women Want that starred Mel Gibson.

Like Gibson before her, Henson's character suddenly develops the ability to hear what members of the opposite sex are thinking and sets out to use that gift to gain an edge over her male colleagues.

The film also stars Kellan Lutz, Richard Roundtree, Tracy Morgan, Aldis Hodge, Jason Jones and Erykah Badu.

Co-stars: The actress also posed for pics with actor Aldis Hodge who is one of her co-stars in the big screen comedy

In an interview with the New York Daily News, Henson explained that the #MeToo movement meant that Hollwyood couldn't do a straight remake of the Gibson movie but instead had to reinvent it.

'They would have got dragged for (a straight remake). A movie about a male chauvinist is not going to work in this climate. We don't care. We don't want to hear it today,' the Empire star told the publication.

'We don't need a man manipulating us like that,' she added. 'We were still asleep back then. We're woke now.'

Castmember: Former Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones also has a role to play. Taraji, who served as an executive producer, wanted to cast actors with a comedic background

Funny guy: SNL alum Tracy Morgan arrived all blinged up with some funky gold medallions

Movie night: Guests at the screening included Alysia Reiner, Robin Roberts, Caroline Gill and Aluad Anei

Henson also served as an executive producer on the film which meant she had a say in the casting of her co-stars.

Her desire, she said, was to cast people who had a comedy background.

'I wanted to have sparring partners in every scene. I wanted witty people,' she said.

Meanwhile, during an appearance on NBC's Today Monday morning, Henson revealed her message to actor Jussie Smollett who plays her son on Empire.

The actor was targeted in an apparent hate crime last week in Chicago.

'Life is spiritual warfare and we're seeing it right before our very eyes. You just have to stay close to what you know,' she said. 'Jussie is love, that's who he is. That's all he knows. In this situation, hate won't win. It will not.'

'I just told him to walk in his truth. To just stay the Jussie that everybody loves,' she said. 'I just told him, 'Walk in your truth, baby, no one can take that from you.''

Smollett, who stars in Fox's Empire as one of the most prominent black gay characters on television, told police he was attacked in the early-morning hours on Jan. 29 by two men who yelled racist and anti-gay slurs, hit him in the face, poured an unknown chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

An incident report released by the Chicago Police Department said Smollett ""did not want to report [the] offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""

The report, obtained by ABC 7 Chicago, said responding officers met with Smollett at his apartment and that the actor had a white rope draped around his neck and ""stained clothing.""

The FBI is leading the investigation into the letter, Guglielmi said.

Chicago police are continuing to investigate the Jan. 29 incident as a possible hate crime.

Guglielmi said in a statement Monday that detectives are continuing to follow-up on leads and review surveillance footage. Authorities have not yet identified two persons of interest in surveillance images the department released last week.

Smollett performed at a nightclub in West Hollywood Saturday and addressed the alleged assault, telling fans he ""fought the fuck back.""

""I'm the gay Tupac!"" Smollett said, as the crowd cheered.

Lawmakers Could Help.,['Scott Colom'],http://jacksonfreepress.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2019/02/04/Jussie-Smollett_AP_19030848594116_cred-zz_Dennis-Van-Tine_STAR-MAX_IPx-2018-5_14_18-Jussie-Smollett-at-The-2018-Fox-Network-Upfront-in-New-York-City_web.jpg,"['opinion', 'hate', 'help', 'law', 'states', 'transgender', 'problem', 'federal', 'lawmakers', 'orientation', 'crimes', 'victims', 'sexual', 'vallum']","Within the past few weeks, hate crimes have been splashed across cable news and newspaper headlines. Racist, homophobic attackers in Chicago allegedly harassed and violently attacked actor Jussie Smollett, sparking a national conversation about hate violence in the United States. Additionally, a transgender woman named Candice Elease Pinky was shot and killed in Houston allegedly for simply being transgender. Both were targeted for who they are, and they serve as a stark reminder about the danger of discrimination in our country.

As a district attorney, I regularly visit with the victims of serious, violent crimes and have to counsel them through what is often one of the most difficult experiences in their lives. I see the pain in their faces and the wounds to their spirit. And I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be for these victims and their families if the crime was an attack on the person’s freedom to be who they are. In that instance, the law should at least stand with the victims and hold the offender accountable for their hate.

Indeed, this is why in 2009, the U.S. Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, expanding the 1969 United States federal hate crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, general identity and disability. These changes passed with strong bipartisan support. Further, in many states in the South—namely Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas—lawmakers have followed this lead, updating their hate crimes laws to include sexual orientation.

Here in Mississippi, we need to catch up with these states in the South and the rest of the country, and update our hate crime laws to include disability, sexual orientation and/or gender identity.

You may not think this is an issue, but recently, Mississippi has seen a rash of this type of hateful violence, including the murders of Mercedes Williamson, Dee Whigham and Mesha Caldwell, all of whom were targeted for their gender identity. Whigham was killed in Biloxi, and Caldwell was killed in Canton.

Mercedes’ boyfriend Joshua Vallum killed her near Lucedale. Vallum brutally assaulted Williamson after he claims he discovered that she was transgender, according to his testimony during his trial. The case gained national attention when Vallum became the first person in the United States to be charged under federal hate crimes law for killing a transgender person. This was only possible because Vallum lured Williamson across state lines, from Alabama into Mississippi—creating federal jurisdiction under the federal hate crimes law. If this murder had taken place in Alabama, this option would not be available because Alabama, like Mississippi, has not updated their state hate crimes law to protect violent crime against people against violence because of disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.

We should fix that so that individuals like Mercedes can get justice they deserve. Right now in the state legislature, bills proposing this change have bipartisan support in both chambers.



These bills would bring us in line with federal law and continue the trend in the South of updating our hate-crime laws.

Here’s the bottom line: No Mississippian—or any American—should be targeted based on who they are. This should be something we can all agree on. We can remedy this injustice by adding sexual orientation, gender identity and disability to our existing hate crimes law so that all Mississippians can feel seen and protected, and so we can deter future crimes against our friends and neighbors. Maybe most importantly, these changes will send an important signal to the country about how much we value and protect individual freedom in Mississippi.

To this, I say, so what? The Bible was used to justify slavery, and in my own time, racists cited this or that biblical passage to assert that racial segregation was precisely what God intended — the “curse of Ham” or the “mark of Cain,” both used to add biblical authority to the rantings of bigots. The mark or the curse is now on the Pences, who share views that in our nation’s history have caused much suffering, including violence.

The other thing Republicans would be sure to say is that racism is different than “mere” anti-gay bias. Yes, indeed. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. Virginia is the state that once led the nation in number of slaves. The inhumanity of slavery is difficult to fathom. It’s more difficult still to comprehend that great men — Washington, Jefferson, Madison . . . you know the names — not only condoned it, but benefited from it.

Later came slavery’s progeny — the Jim Crow era. I am talking of everything from the absurdity of segregated state parks to the barbarity of lynchings. In Atlanta in 1899, a black man was mutilated and then burned, with portions of his body distributed among the crowd. The man’s name was Sam Hose. He was probably innocent of murder but not, of course, of being black.

The destructive power of blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes in that yearbook picture cannot be underestimated. But let’s ponder, too, the harm of hateful homophobia. It has taken countless lives over the years, caused huge suffering and, like racism, persists to this day.

Homophobia is a staple of the racist right — Nazis, white nationalists and other adherents of mindless goonery — and, at times, results in the murder of gay and transgender people. In 2017, 20 gay, bisexual or queer men were murdered in hate crimes, an increase of 400 percent from the previous year. The problem is hardly going away. And, infamously, in 1998, Matthew Shepard, was beaten, tortured and left to die because he was gay. Last year, his ashes were interred at Washington National Cathedral in a ceremony presided over by a gay Episcopal bishop, with music provided by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington.

And when racial hatred and homophobia are combined, the results can be particularly disturbing. Last week, singer and actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two men who allegedly yelled anti-gay and anti-black epithets.

Pence has long been criticized as being hostile toward LGBTQ issues. He has linked same-sex couples to a “societal collapse” and even once seemed to support conversion therapy, which is a form of torture. A vice president who has expressed such intolerance is a dangerous model.

In certain corners of the right-wing media, criticism of Karen Pence for recently taking a job at the Immanuel Christian School in Springfield was denounced as nothing less than religious bigotry. After all, the argument went, the school is a Christian school, ultraconservative and ultratraditional, and is entitled to teach according to its deeply held beliefs. No doubt. But while the United States has traditionally given religion wide berth — and still does — lines have been drawn. Utah was not admitted as a state until the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy.

AD

AD

No one is advocating a law requiring Immanuel Christian to practice tolerance, both in its pedagogy and its hiring practices. But the First Amendment that guarantees the school’s rights also gives us the right to criticize. It is simply wrong to foster a belief that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are immoral.

I have been torn about Northam — about whether a single yearbook photo negates a lifetime of tolerance. But I am not torn about Mike and Karen Pence. They are figures of consequence, and their bigotry — regardless of their religious justification — has to be confronted.

Smollett, the 36-year-old musician and actor who appears on “Empire,” told police that he was accosted on the street at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. ABC7 in Chicago obtained a partially redacted copy of the report through a Freedom of Information Request on Monday.

According to the report, the officers were told that Smollett “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

The report states that police found Smollett with a white rope around his neck, and that he stated the attackers threw an unknown chemical substance on him, staining his clothes. Smollett said he was accosted by two men dressed in black, one of whom was wearing a ski mask. He did not remember any other details of the suspects.

Chicago police have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage in an effort to find the attackers, but have not found video of the attack. The department released an image of two “persons of interest” in the case on Wednesday.

Eddie Johnson, the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, told reporters on Friday that progress was being made.

“He is a victim and we treat him like a victim,” Johnson said. “He’s been very cooperative.”

Smollett performed on Saturday at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, during which he sought to clarify some details of the incident.

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalized,” he said on stage. “And above all: I fought the f— back.”"

That rapper is Joe Budden, who addressed what he feels are some logical issues with Smollett's account of the event on episode 218 of The Joe Budden Podcast.

Specifically speaking, Budden has doubts that the attack on Smollett, which took place last Tuesday (Jan. 29), was a hate crime.

“You know, it’s a shame that we[‘re] in this era where I gotta think twice about if I’m allowed to think something,"" he began for one part of the podcast. ""I don’t believe that nigga was atta—it was a hate crime. I don’t believe that. Sorry! I should reserve that right is what I’m saying today.”

All told, Joe, Rory and Mal discussed the Smollett attack for just about 10 minutes, and it's clear that they didn't find the Empire star’s recollection of the attack to be a convincing one. “Fam, do y’all believe his story?” Joe asked Rory and Mal, who both seemed skeptical.

Joe then brings up Taraji P. Henson’s post about Smollett-focused Instagram post, which includes a video snippet of the singer-actor's 2017 song “F.U.W.” It appears Budden might be hinting at Henson possibly milking the press coverage Smollett's gotten since the attack. He also has problems with believing that Smollett would be so comfortable with a noose around his neck. Smollett reportedly had the rope around his neck while he was talking to authorities.

“Any Black person that tells you that they had a noose put on them and left it there for the next 45 minutes, you should ask questions,"" Joe continued. ""That’s not a normal thing, just in psychology. But okay; got it.”

In response to claims that Smollett kept the noose around his neck to “preserve the evidence,"" Joe said, “I would believe that if your next move after this attack was to call the police—it was not. You called your manager and that was uh, 40 minutes later. And then the police got a call.""

All in all, Budden thinks he's got a healthy amount of skepticism for the Smollett situation.

""There are at least 25 different reasons to be a little skeptical. It tough to believe things,"" he continued. ""I don't believe Hollywood. I don't believe actors. I don't believe police and I don't believe the government. And all of those entities are here. So pardon me if my third eye is a little attentive.""

Joe also wanted to make it clear that he's not trying to be insensitive to anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime. He says he's simply asking questions.

After Justin Timberlake grabbed Janet Jackson's costume (inadvertently or not), baring her body to the world, Jackson was blacklisted from the Super Bowl while Timberlake was... invited back. The injustice seemed especially pronounced during yesterday's Super Bowl — and what turned out to be another shirtless singer. Twitter celebrated #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay before Adam Levine's shirtless performance brought up the issue of double standards all over again.

It actually all started in 2018, as Glamour reported. Former NFL star and filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry proposed the idea of a day to honor Jackson, who, when looked at through the lens of societal progress since the early 2000s, at least in my opinion, took the fall for something that was Timberlake's fault.

""We should do a #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay this Sunday,"" Cherry tweeted in the lead up to the 2018 game, to which there were hundreds of enthusiastic replies about how Jackson's music inspired fans as they were growing up. As #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay went viral, celebrities including Jussie Smollett got into the act.

Happily, when it came time to prep for the 2019 kickoff of football's biggest day, loyal Jackson fans and appreciators of social justice hadn't forgotten, with the hashtag getting revived, as Huff Post detailed. Stars including Gabrielle Union bowed to the Queen of Pop yesterday.

""I didn't think I looked cool enough to meet my hero,"" Union shared yesterday on Twitter. ""Y'all, she got up, hugged me, & told me she was proud of me. I. Died. # Janetjacksonappreciationday.""

And the difference in the treatment of a black woman versus a white man in the wake of a controversy was brought up all over again when Timberlake was invited back to the Super Bowl last year, as Glamour reported in an additional article.

Many fans noticed the hypocrisy, the magazine reported, recalling that Jackson, besides being banned from the NFL for life after the infamous so-called ""wardrobe malfunction,"" was also uninvited from that year's Grammy Awards. In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell admitted that, looking back, Jackson had been unfairly targeted for the incident as opposed to Timberlake, Glamour added.

Many Jackson supporters noted last year that Timblerlake has never publicly apologized to Jackson for letting her shoulder the blame, USA Today reported, launching yet another hashtag, #JusticeforJanet. The paper, however, noted that Timberlake implied he has personally made his amends to the singer.

Ironically, yesterday's game brought up the old wound yet again when Adam Levine took off his shirt during his halftime performance, revealing a tattoo-filled torso, as Us Weekly reported. The singer's bare chest, which didn't seem to shock the crowd at all, reminded some Twitter fans that there is still a gigantic double standard.

I don't have a shred of doubt that the double standard is still pretty big and that both racism and sexism played into Jackson's fate post-2004, when her career seemed to stall, as website Toofab noted.

But class and talent will always out in the end: E! News reported that the Rhythm Nation songstress, who is currently touring, will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in March. About time."

In the photo, Bialik and Parsons do a bit of twinning, sporting similar eyeglasses as they pose for the camera, with the famously out-of-order elevator from the hit CBS sitcom behind them.

“We’re a bespectacled spectacle,” Bialik wrote of the image, including an emoji of a pair of glasses.

The image drew a number of reactions, ranging from amusement to admiration to, somehow, sadness.

“Say that five times fast,” urged one commenter, who apparently found Bialik’s message to be quite the tongue-twister.

“This is the perfect picture of you both!” enthused another fan.

And then there was another commenter, who despite the whimsical nature of Bialik’s post, noted, “Every photo reminds us that the end is near.”

That last response was punctuated by a trio of crying-face emojis.
