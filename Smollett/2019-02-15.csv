One of the suspects in the alleged attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was previously arrested in Chicago for attempted murder, a report said Friday.

The man was busted in 2011 for a stabbing in the north Chicago neighborhood near where authorities raided a house Wednesday night and confiscated items related to the Smollett case, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.

He struck a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment for the 2011 attack, the paper said.

The sentence was two years probation and the man was ordered to pay a $674 fine, the paper said.

The suspect and his brother were arrested on Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport for the Smollett attack after returning from Nigeria. At least one of them worked on “Empire,” reports said.

Their involvement in the attack was not immediately clear, but detectives were questioning them Friday.

Smollett says he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, and walking home from a Subway restaurant in Chicago at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was accosted by two people who shouted racial slurs, tied a noose around his neck and doused him with a “chemical substance” resembling bleach."

Both are Nigerians, and one appeared on Empire in the past. Police had questioned them earlier this week. While police told PJ Media they have yet to find any video documenting the alleged attack, they insisted there is no evidence it is a hoax.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer at the Chicago Police Department, told PJ Media.

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added. Smollett claimed that on January 29, masked white attackers wearing MAGA hats had screamed “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-smelling liquid on him.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records to police, and Guglielmi said those records “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” ABC7 Chicago reported. Even so, it appears police have not discovered conclusive evidence that Smollett was lying.

This week, The New York Post discovered a suspicious hot sauce bottle with bleach-smelling liquid that may have been planted at the scene to corroborate Smollett’s story, which might be a hoax.

On Wednesday, CPD confirmed to PJ Media that even though the hot sauce bottle was not found at the scene during the initial police canvases and the video footage did not capture the attack, they still consider Smollett a victim.

As for the men arrested, Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and his brother Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo are Nigerian bodybuilders and aspiring actors On February 1, Abel Osundairo posted a video to Instagram showing him in Nigeria. In January 2019, Abel posted a video to Instagram using Smollett’s song “Ha Ha (I Love You)” as a backing track. Ola Osundairo appeared in Empire playing Chris Rock’s bodyguard.

“For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects,” Chicago Police told PJ Media. “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Police arrested the Osundairos on Wednesday. “No charges have been issued,” Guglielmi told PJ Media.

It seems increasingly likely the Jussie Smollett story — MAGA hat-wearing whites assaulting a black gay actor — is a hoax. If these Nigerian suspects carried out the alleged attack, that does not fit Smollett’s narrative. If they conspired with Smollett to fabricate the story, that’s even worse.

They had been held over the attack on Jussie, 36, who was allegedly beaten, doused in acid and had a noose put around his neck in an attack last month in Chicago.

The brothers appeared as extras in Jussie’s hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym, according to reports.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said.

Cops previously said that the pair were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

NEW EVIDENCE FROM INTERROGATIONS

The development comes after Jussie hit back at claims he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Jussie, 36, told how he was punched and kicked by white attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, said the men also called him a “f***ot”.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

“It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said.

“So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has been hit by claims that the attack was faked.

'NO SIGNS ATTACK WAS A HOAX'

The police spokesman said that there is ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say local media reports that allege the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced late Thursday as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is Black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two were arrested for “probable cause” of committing assault and battery on the Empire star but had not been charged.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on January 29.

The two suspects — whom police identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on Empire.

Mr Guglielmi said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about exactly what police found.

His comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed.

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous”.

Mr Guglielmi reiterated on Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect”.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off.

Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Mr Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence.

He said police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Trending News: Police Arrest 2 Suspects in Connection to Attack on Jussie Smollett

Police have arrested two men in connection with the alleged attack against “Empire” star Jussie Smollett on January 29. The two suspects, said to be Nigerian brothers, have not yet been charged with a crime, CNN reports.

Smollett, an openly gay and African-American man, told police he was assaulted by two attackers who berated him with racial and homophobic slurs. The 36-year-old said he was left with a noose around his neck, covered in bleach on the street. At the time, police called the attack a “possible hate crime.”

Immediately following the attack, allegations were made that stated Smollett’s story was untrue, but police have since put out there that there’s “no evidence” the actor was lying.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, according to the Chicago Tribune. ""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Guglielmi added that police are ""working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.""

The names of the alleged attackers have not been released, but police say at least one of them already knew Smollett from the set of “Empire,” reports CNN. The brothers are also said to have police records, with one sentenced to two years probation after an aggravated battery charge in 2012. The other is said to have a DUI from 2015, according to the Chicago Tribune.

On February 14, Smollett appeared on “Good Morning America” to clear up what had happened to him, expressing his frustration about not being believed.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said on the show. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Smollett also said that while the attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” they weren’t wearing the red and white hats characteristic of Donald Trump’s supporters.

""I never said that,"" he said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.""

But the man, Landberto Quintero, remains a mystery to authorities.

Norwalk police on Feb. 15 released Quintero’s name and hoped the move would prompt relatives to come forward. Authorities haven’t been able to identify any of his family members.

“We don’t really know much about him,” Lt. Art Weisgerber said. “He had no known address. He was not in any missing person database, so he was never reported missing to any agencies.”

Quintero was 24 years old and was born in Mexico, according to records of a 1993 arrest for trespassing in Norwalk. Those records included the fingerprints that ended up in a national database run by the FBI. Weisgerber believes Quintero may have been homeless.

Quintero’s body was discovered on city-owned Shea Island in Long Island Sound on April 18, 1996. There were no obvious signs of trauma, police said.

The chief medical examiner’s office concluded he had been dead for eight to 10 months but was not able to determine the cause or manner of death.

Previous searches of the national fingerprint database and a 2016 DNA test were unsuccessful. But after the database was updated, Weisgerber recently asked the state crime lab to re-examine the fingerprints from the body. A crime lab expert called him Thursday to say a positive identification had been made.

All that is known about Quintero is that he likely lived in the Norwalk area for at least three years, judging from his 1993 arrest and his body being discovered in 1996.

The autopsy showed he was about 5-foot-2 and 110 pounds. In his 1993 booking photo, Quintero sports what appears to be a “mullet” hairstyle—short in the front and long in the back.

Police Have Identified Two Potential Suspects Arrested in Jussie Smollett Attack Case: Reports

Identifying victims can be just as difficult as identifying perpetrators, even when a surveillance camera has captured them.

Two men have been arrested as “potential suspects” in connection with the Jussie Smollett case, CNN reported.

The men, identified as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were taken in for questioning, but now Chicago police officials are calling them “potential suspects” in the attack, TMZ reported on Feb. 15.

Their home was raided by police on Feb. 13, and they seized evidence, including bottles of bleach that were allegedly used in the assault against Smollett, who appeared on the show “Empire,” according to the report.

ARRESTS made in Jussie Smollett attack. Gepostet von TMZ am Freitag, 15. Februar 2019

A law enforcement official said that they will be placed in a lineup in which Smollett will be asked to identify suspects in the attack.

Smollett said that his attackers were white and yelled “this is MAGA country” in a late-night incident, apparently in reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Smollett also alleged his two attackers shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him last month before wrapping a rope around his neck, according to previous reports.

But the Osundairo brothers, who are originally from Nigeria, don’t fit the description the actor had gave to police.

One of the brothers told TMZ that he worked on “Empire.” Smollett played a prison inmate on season two of the show.

Police sources have told a number of news outlets, including the Chicago Tribune, that they are investigating the possibility that the attack was staged with the help of the two brothers.

Their attorney also told the Tribune that they knew the actor and spent time with him at the gym.

Reports said they were arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, but details were scant.

Smollett released a statement Feb. 14, which said, “Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” ABC7 reported.

There was speculation that Smollett’s character was being booted from “Empire,” which prompted his representatives to issue a statement on the matter.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment also attempted to clarify the rumor. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” it said, the ABC affiliate reported.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that detectives “haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack,” but he said there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” the Tribune report said.

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he said.

Chicago police investigators are “working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” the spokesman said.

In an interview with ABC News, Smollett also said that “I respect too much the people who—I am now one of those people—who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

Two brothers of Nigerian descent, one of whom appeared as an extra on Empire, had their home raided by Chicago police Wednesday night as part of an investigation into the potentially staged attack.

CBS 2 investigative journalist Brad Edwards, citing a source with intimate knowledge of the Chicago Police Department’s investigation into the matter, claims the attack on Smollett was “potentially orchestrated” by the actor and the two men, who are persons of interest in the case.

Information Liberation reports: Both men reportedly left for Nigeria on the day of the attack, according to Charlie De Mar of CBS Chicago.

From CWBChicago:

Chicago police today are questioning two persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett hate crime investigation, according to a department spokesperson. Both are African-American. Smollett, who police say “has been questioned throughout” their investigation is also being interrogated.

The persons of interest were arrested at O’Hare airport on Wednesday night, police said.

Smollett said in an interview aired on Good Morning America today that he believed the two persons of interest seen in the CPD images were the persons who attacked him. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

TMZ reported that the persons of interest are an actor who has appeared with Smollett on Fox television’s Empire and a person who was traveling with the second actor. These individuals are believed to be the “potential persons of interest” who were seen in low-quality images released by Chicago police days after the alleged attack, according to a police spokesperson.

TMZ also reported that police used “rideshare and/or taxicab records” to identify the “persons of interest” and to track their movements on the night of the purported attack.

CWBChicago shared this tip they got last week:

They suspect police had these suspects in their sight all along and used the “heavily redacted” phone records Smollett handed over to nail them because he removed their calls from the list.

As CWBChicago reported: “Investigators already received Smollett’s complete phone records via a subpoena served on his service provider, according to a source close quoted by CWBChicago on Feb. 4.”

“A source familiar with the records provided by the Empire star states that Smollett downloaded his phone activity into a spreadsheet and then deleted certain phone calls before handing over the records. ‘He did the [detectives’] job for them because then they only had to focus on the numbers he deleted.'”

Chicago PD are denying the report:

Though a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said that claim is “unconfirmed,” two suspects have been arrested who were reportedly close with Smollett — appearing on the set of “Empire” with Smollett as well as recently working out at a gym with the openly-gay, African American star who claims that two men attacked him and screamed, “This is MAGA country!”

If the attack turns out to have been staged, it will be the biggest racially-motivated hoax since the Tawana Brawley case in the late 1980s.

A Fox Nation documentary titled, “Scandalous: The Mysterious Case of Tawana Brawley” chronicled an alleged racially-motivated attack against an African-American teen in New York in 1987. The teen claimed that she had been raped by a group of white men and was left with “racial slurs” scrawled all over her body. Brawley showed up at an emergency room with text written on her body including the words “KKK,” “n**ger” and “b**ch.”

The case served as a “springboard” for a young civil rights activist by the name of Reverend Al Sharpton, who led the charge of riling up the African-American community and assisting the teen and her family with the claims. The activism included marching in the streets of New York to demand “justice” for the alleged racially-motivated attack and high-profile press conferences to accuse members of the New York law enforcement community perpetrating the vile acts.

The story rocked New York and fanned the flames of racial tensions even beyond the Empire State.

Like the Smollett case, the attack caught the attention of Hollywood stars including Bill Cosby who donated $25,000 as a reward for information on the case and boxing promoter Don King who pledged $100,000 toward Brawley’s college education.

The Nation of Islam’s Louis Farrakhan also joined Rev. Sharpton as nearly 1,000 people from the African-American community marched in the streets chanting, “No justice, no peace.”

However, as details emerged the African-American teen’s story begin to fall apart and Fox News reported that “after an extensive investigation filled with twists and turns, a grand jury found the allegations to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax.” The grand jury found that not only had she not been the victim of forcible sexual assault, but that she likely had concocted the story as a ruse. It is believed that Brawley had simply run away from home for the weekend and — fearing her step-father’s punishment — had created an elaborate tale of an attack.

Although the grand jury ultimately cleared the accused men, severe damage had been done — one of the officers committed suicide from the stress of the case and a race war was incited throughout New York by Sharpton and his allies.

The Fox documentary called the Brawley case “the lie that made Al Sharpton famous.”

Could the Smollett case fall into the same category?

It is unthinkable, but it is possible that this is “Tawana Brawley 2.0.”

The African-American TV star has thus far refused to hand over complete cell phone records from the night of the attack, which Chicago police state has made it difficult for law enforcement to get to the bottom of the case. He also failed to show up for further questioning with police on Thursday, though his representative claimed he made himself available later in the day for a conversation. (It isn’t clear if the availability was in person or over the phone.)

If Smollett staged his own attack, it could be the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people since the Brawley case, which took place 31 years ago this winter.

Unlike the Brawley case, the penalties for falsely reporting a crime ought to be swift and fierce in order to deliver a message that false claims are not only a waste of precious law enforcement resources, but an affront to every true victim of crime, bigotry and racism in America.

Inside Edition asked experts in behavioral science to analyze and provide opinion about the actor's demeanor when he spoke with Robin Roberts Thursday on “Good Morning America,"" his first TV interview since he was allegedly attacked in Chicago.

Smollett's smile at the beginning of the interview was the first thing that struck prosecutor Wendy Patrick as slightly odd, she said.

""We call it counterintuition, sometimes the mannerisms don’t match the message, but that is not often due to dishonesty, it is also due to nervousness,"" she told Inside Edition.

Patrick added, in her opinion, that she found Smollett more focused on his feelings than the actual facts of his case.

""In the moment, adrenaline is flowing, our attention is divided, particularly if it is a traumatic incident – we may not remember the exact details but we sure remember how we felt during the incident,"" she explained.

Former special agent Roger Strecker, who has more than 30 years of experience in law enforcement, told Inside Edition, in his opinion, he found it strange that Smollett shared so many details.

""A lot of times, a person that is not being truthful will create extraneous information that is not necessary or is not part of the predicate question,"" he said.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the alleged attack. Both men have links the 36-year-old actor and have appeared as extras on “Empire,"" after some published reports questioned whether Smollett’s claims we’re a hoax. However, police said Friday there is no evidence that ""this is a hoax.""

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Los Angeles Times in a statement. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Chicago police have released two men arrested in connection with an alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

The US TV star needed hospital treatment last month after a suspected racist and homophobic attack.

A police spokesperson said on Friday the men were released without charge and were no longer being classified as suspects.

Jussie Smollett said he'd been ""forever changed"" by the alleged attack, which took place on 29 January.

The 36-year-old actor has said two white men hurling racial and homophobic insults punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck.

Earlier, police had dismissed local media reports that the alleged attack was a hoax, and said Mr Smollett continued to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.

Who are the men arrested?

Two men, Nigerian brothers, were arrested in connection with the incident on Wednesday.

They had worked as Empire extras, sometimes going to the gym with the actor, their lawyer said.

They had been picked up at Chicago's O'Hare airport, returning from a trip to Nigeria, their lawyer told US media.

""When they first learned about what happened to [Jussie] they were horrified,"" Gloria Schmidt told CBS Chicago. ""This is someone they've worked with, so they don't want to see somebody go through that.""

A police spokesman initially said they were treating the unidentified men as ""potential suspects"" as there was ""probable cause"" that they may have engaged in a crime. No further details were given.

On Thursday, police had searched their home.

At least one of the brothers worked on Empire, police confirmed.

What does Jussie Smollett say?

Representatives for Smollett have not yet commented on the latest developments in the case.

But recounting the night publicly for the first time, he told US network ABC he had hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride.

""We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.""

When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach.

""I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened.""

The actor said he had just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He said he had ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food - something people have questioned as strange.

He told Good Morning America it was ""ridiculous"" that people thought he would lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures.

""Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to Subway,"" he said.

He said he thought he would've been doubted less if he had said his alleged attacker ""was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black"".

""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

There were claims he had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump.

""I never said that. I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

But the attackers did say ""This is MAGA country"", he said.

The actor said he thought he had been targeted because he was outspoken about President Trump - who when asked about the attack said ""That's horrible, it doesn't get worse"".

""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,"" Mr Smollett said of Mr Trump's comments.

Writers of Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack - and after reports that plans to write him off the show had led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

The two men have not been charged nor have the police said what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

Smollett reported to Chicago police on January 29th that he had been physically attacked by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the 36-year old actor. He also said that the alleged suspects wore MAGA(Make America Great Again) baseball caps.

Police have arrested two suspects over the “racially-charged assault” of Empire star Jussie Smollett in Chicago.

Two men have been detained in relation to the attack of Smollett on January 29, during which he was subjected to homophobic slurs and had a chemical substance poured on him, reported NBC on Friday (February 15).

The pair, who are brothers, are “under arrest and being questioned as suspects but have not been charged,” according to police as reported by NBC.

A Chicago police spokesperson told NBC: “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

The 36-year-old actor, who came out as gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, was attacked at approximately 2am in E. North Lower Water Street last month.

Smollett has since been discharged from hospital and returned to the Empire set earlier this month.

Police treating Jussie Smollett attack as a hate crime

Detectives are treating the assault as a potential hate crime.

It was recently reported that the FBI are searching for the people responsible for sending Empire star Jussie Smollett hate mail days before he was assaulted in a suspected homophobic and racist attack in Chicago.

According to TMZ, the FBI is working with the Empire crew to hunt down the person or people behind a threatening letter sent to Smollett in the days leading up to his assault.

Sources told TMZ that Empire hired a private security company to set up a system of screening all mail received by the cast with the FBI.

FBI screen all mail sent to Jussie Smollett and Empire set

One hateful letter sent to Smollett calls him a “black fag,” reports TMZ.

Smollett and other members of the Empire cast have reportedly been sent hate mail previously.

However, security are on high alert following Smollett’s assault.

Following the attack, the cast of Empire took to social media to show their support for Smollett.

“In terms of what happened the other day to Jussie… this is what happens.” —Ellen Page

Other celebrities, including Ellen Page, also spoke out in solidarity with Smollett.

On a recent episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Page condemned US Vice President Mike Pence’s anti-LGBT+ views before telling the studio audience to “connect the dots.”

She said: “In terms of what happened the other day to Jussie… this is what happens.”

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering—what do you think is going to happen?” asked the Gaycation star.

“Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”"

At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of this afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi said police also searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

The police spokesman’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax.

Police said those reports were unconfirmed. And the producers of “Empire” disputed as “patently ridiculous” news reports that Smollett’s character was being written out of the show before the attack.

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Police have identified the pair only as Nigerian brothers, the station said. Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told WGN they were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport Wednesday and taken into custody upon their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one of them worked on ""Empire.""

Police told WLS-TV they have a relationship with Smollett but no charges have yet been filed against them.

Ben Bradley of WGN went further Thursday, reporting that the two men police were questioning are black:

Guglielmi added to the station that he didn't know in what capacity the one suspect worked on the show but confirmed a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived; he didn't have information on what police found, WGN said.

But Charlie De Mar of Chicago's WMAQ-TV said police ""took bleach, shoes, electronics, and more"" in the raid:

Staged attack?

WLS also said — citing multiple sources — that police are investigating if Smollett and the two men staged the incident allegedly because Smollett was being written off ""Empire.""

But Guglielmi denied that report:

And Smollett's reps denied he was being written off the show, WLS said, and added a statement from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment saying likewise: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""



'White' attackers?

TMZ initially reported — citing ""sources directly connected to Jussie"" — that he was attacked by two ""white"" men ""wearing ski masks.""

Problem is, neither Smollett nor police revealed the alleged attackers' skin color. In addition, Smollett never mentioned his alleged attackers' race during his lengthy interview this week with ABC's Robin Roberts, noting, ""I can't tell you what color their eyes were, and I did not see anything except the second person I saw running away. And the first person, I saw his stature. I gave the description as best as I could ... You have to understand also that it's Chicago, in winter. People can wear ski masks, and nobody's going to question that.""

Yet TMZ still ran with a story Friday saying it ""broke many of the details of Jussie's story just hours after the attack,"" including that ""his 2 attackers were white.""



Anything else?

Neighbors of the men now under arrest told WLS they believe the suspects are Nigerian brothers who grew up in that apartment, and have lived there for years. Neighbors added to the station that they appeared to be friendly and possibly body builders who long have wanted to be actors.

Smollett said in his interview with Roberts that he believes the figures seen in a dark, grainy surveillance image released by Chicago police are the individuals who he said victimized him in a racist, homophobic attack at 2 a.m. Jan. 29.

CPD public information officer Sally Bown added to TheBlaze Thursday that she wasn't sure if the two suspects who had at that point only been brought in for questioning as ""persons of interest"" are the same individuals in the surveillance photo.



Image source: Chicago police

On Thursday Guglielmi said in a statement, ""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case.""

Smollett, 36, also told Roberts he's "" pissed off"" at assertions his claims are a hoax:

It's like, you know at first it was a thing of like, ""Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cuz it's the truth."" Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth."" And then it became a thing of like, ""Ohhh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,"" he added to Roberts, according to ABC News. ""And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""



He also disputed a claim that he said his alleged attackers ""were wearing MAGA hats"" — the iconic red caps with President Donald Trump's 2016 ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan: ""I never said that.""

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett added, ABC News said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f***ot, they called me a [N-word]. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

While at least one outlet, Forbes, reported the alleged attackers wore MAGA hats, numerous outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the Smollett was beaten up by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollet, who's openly gay, also said he was angered by claims the incident was ""a date gone bad, which I so resent ... I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive. Yes, there's Grinder, yes, there's Jack'd, yes there's all of these things, which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I'm sayin'? But I haven't been on that in years.""

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Moore, during the alleged incident. But Chicago police said the ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records Smollett turned over detectives ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation"" as cops continue looking into Smollett's claims, WBBM-TV reported.

Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Other curious details:

Police told ABC News that Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building. CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

UPDATE (2/16/2019): The two Nigerian brothers who were arrested and considered to be suspects in the alleged attack on actor-singer Jussie Smollett have been released by the Chicago Police Department according to a spokesperson. ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the department, tweeted. There have been no other reports of additional suspects in the case.

ORIGINAL (2/15/2019): Two men who were questioned about the alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett are now considered suspects in the case, NBC News reports. Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielimi said that the men were arrested based on probable cause of their involvement in the crime. They have not yet been charged.

The two men have been identified as Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked on Empire, though the CDP did not specify in what capacity. An attorney for the suspects told the Chicago Tribune that her clients know Smollett from working on the show and that they had also spent time at the gym with him.

On Thursday, the CPD debunked circulating media rumors that Smollett was involved in the attack. CPD called the theory that the attack was a hoax “unconfirmed by case detectives” and that supposed CPD sources were “uninformed and inaccurate.” The rumors, which were first reported by ABC7 Chicago, alleged that Smollett helped to plan the attack because his character was being written off of Empire.

20th Century Fox stepped in to debunk those rumors, as well.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the studio said in statement to Deadline. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett told investigators that his attackers yelled “this is MAGA country” during the attack, which occurred in Chicago in the early hours of January 29. TMZ’s original report of the incident noted that the actor had received intimidating mail at the Fox studio where Empire shoots that said “Die black fag.”

Police currently have a video of Smollett with a rope around his neck after the attack, but say they will not release it until the investigation is over.

Police must charge the men involved with a crime by Friday evening or release them, according to NBC News.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,"" Guglielmi said. ""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

Richard Shotwell/AP Police have denied reports alleging the attack was a hoax and said Jussie Smollett is being treated as a victim.

Police have been questioning the men since they were picked up by officers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria, the Associated Press reported. Police served a search warrant at their home on Thursday.

At least one of the men worked on Empire, but Guglielmi did not know in what capacity, the AP said.

Smollett recounted his ordeal on US breakfast show Good Morning America on Thursday and again said that his attackers yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical on him.

He also said an image Chicago police released showing persons of interest did indeed show his attackers.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said. ""Never did.""

The musician, an openly gay LGBTQ advocate who plays an openly gay musician on the Fox musical drama, said he spoke up because ""people need to hear the truth"".

""Everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young, black children, to know how strong that they are,"" he said.

Representatives for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing US President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Star Wars Episode 9 has wrapped and we can’t stop crying about it.

And it looks like we aren’t the only emotional ones as director JJ Abrams and star John Boyega took to Twitter to say goodbye – with John giving a heartfelt display of gratitude to the director for helping ‘make his dreams come true.’

JJ marked the last day of shooting the final film in the Skywalker saga by sharing an emotional photo of cast members Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac hugging it out on set.

The director tweeted: ‘It feels impossible, but today wrapped photography on Episode IX. There is no adequate way to thank this truly magical crew and cast. I’m forever indebted to you all.’

John shared the exact same photo, and his message left us trying to convince everyone around us that we weren’t crying – it was just raining on our faces.

The 26-year-old star said to his 1.6 million Instagram followers: ‘That’s a wrap on Star Wars episode 9 and the end to a chapter of my life that I couldn’t be more thankful for.

‘What a process! It really has been a joy to be in these movies surrounded by amazing people. I personally want to thank @jjabrams for giving me a chance to make my dreams come true.’

The movie is yet to receive an official title – the first two films from the trilogy had title reveals not long after the wrap – but that has not stopped fans from throwing about theories for the title.

According to one dedicated Star Wars Redditer, a ‘reliable source’ has touted the next film is called Son Of Darkness.

But what does it all mean? And let us remind you that this is all a rumour for now.

Some say it might have something to do with Luke Skywalker, you know, being Darth Vader’s son and all. So Kylo Ren may not be the only factor that you could consider.

The title theory comes from Supreme Leader Snoke during a conversation with Kylo Ren in The Last Jedi, in which he said: ‘My worthy apprentice, Son of Darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader, where there was conflict I now sense resolved, where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training and fulfil your destiny.’

While many fans were chuffed at the little theory for what’s the come, as some believe a trailer will be upon us very soon, it’s got others a little confused and ‘meh’ about the whole thing.

One keen bean wrote on Twitter: ‘Star wars: son of darkness as the final installment of the sequel trilogy’s tittle sounds awful [sic].’

Another, alongside a gif of Gordon Ramsay, wasn’t liking it: ‘There’s a rumour that @starwars #episode9 will be title “son of darkness”….we’re now dipping into B grade horror titles now.’

We have a while to wait until we get the news, let alone the movie itself which isn’t out until December.

At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Guglielmi said police also searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

The police spokesman’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax.

Police said those reports were unconfirmed. And the producers of “Empire” disputed as “patently ridiculous” news reports that Smollett’s character was being written out of the show before the attack.

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

A Chicago police spokesperson confirmed to ETOnline that the men seen in the January 29 surveillance images were the same men they interviewed as persons of interest prior to their arrests. The spokesperson said the two men and their attorney met with detectives Thursday and plan to do the same today.

WBBM reported that the two suspects—Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo–were identified by their attorney, Gloria Schmidt. Police reportedly raided the brothers’ home Wednesday, the same day they met them at O’Hare International Airport, as they returned from Nigeria.

While authorities haven’t disclosed a motive, WLS-TV reporter Rob Elgas tweeted that multiple sources claimed the men were “Empire” extras and carried out the attack because Smollet’s character was expected to be written off the show.

Smollett, 35, was reportedly exiting a Chicago Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. January 29 when one of two men in ski masks asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” before they both allegedly attacked the openly gay, black actor. Reports indicated that the men also allegedly tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid, possibly bleach, on him before fleeing the scene.

News of the men’s arrests come a day after police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi debunked reports that they were investigating whether Smollett orchestrated the assault.

Joining the previously announced Joshua Bassett (Stuck in the Middle) are Olivia Rodrigo (Bizaardvark), Kate Reinders (Modern Family), Sofia Wylie (Andi Mack), Matt Cornett (Bella and the Bulldogs), Dara Renee (Freaky Friday), Julia Lester (Mom), Frankie Rodriguez (Modern Family), Larry Saperstein (Fan Girl), and Mark St. Cyr (Doomsday).

The 10-episode series centers around a group of East High students counting down to opening night of their school’s first-ever production of ‘High School Musical.’ Per its synopsis:

Show-mances blossom; friendships are tested while new ones are made; rivalries flare; and lives are changed forever as these young people discover the transformative power that only a high school drama club can provide.

Complete cast and character breakdowns as released by Disney+:

Joshua Bassett (Ricky) – Basset is an 18 year-old actor and songwriter from Oceanside, California. He had a recurring role on Disney Channel's ""Stuck in the Middle,"" recently guest starred on ""Dirty John"" and can currently be seen in a recurring role on ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy."" Bassett plays Ricky, a sarcastic yet charismatic skate rat and high school junior, who launches a bold plan to prove himself to his ex-girlfriend Nini — by auditioning to star opposite her in the school's first-ever production of ""High School Musical: the Musical.""

Olivia Rodrigo (Nini) – Born and raised in Temecula, California, Rodrigo has been singing, playing music and acting since she was age six. She most recently starred in Disney Channel's comedy ""Bizaardvark."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodrigo plays Nini, who just returned from summer theater camp after finding her voice, her confidence — and her new boyfriend. Fiercely loyal to her two moms, Nini is a star — if she can just believe in herself long enough to stay put in the spotlight.

Kate Reinders (Miss Jenn) – A stage, film and television actress, Reinders was a series regular on ABC's ""Work It"" and Lifetime's ""Sherri"" and guest starred on ""Modern Family"" and ""Ugly Betty."" Her theatre roles include Broadway productions of ""Meteor Shower,"" ""Something Rotten!,"" ""Wicked,"" Sam Mendes' revival of ""Gypsy"" and ""Beautiful, the Carole King Musical."" Her ""High School Musical: The Musical"" character, Miss Jenn, is the school's new high-energy, low-reality drama teacher, who believes musicals can save lives. She may suffer from serious imposter syndrome, but she would do anything for her students, even if it means fudging a few credits on her C.V.

Sofia Wylie (Gina) – Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Wylie has a starring role in Disney Channel's critically-acclaimed series ""Andi Mack"" and most recently made her musical debut with ""Side by Side,"" part of the ""Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts"" special. She is recording her debut single which should be out late 2019. Wylie is also the voice of Riri Williams in the ""Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron"" animation series and just made her big screen debut with a leading title in Marvista's ""Back of the Net."" Her character, Gina, is a recent transfer student and a diehard theater kid with as many skeletons in the closet as she has credits on her résumé. She is both ambitious and entitled, and dead set on showing Miss Jenn that she made a huge mistake in casting her as the understudy.

Matt Cornett (E.J.) – Born in Rogers, Arkansas, Cornett had a recurring role on ""Bella and The Bulldogs"" and guest starred on ""The Middle,"" ""Southland"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" among others. He will play E.J., Nini's new love interest, the supremely confident son of two corporate lawyers, who secretly battles the pressure of living up to his picture-perfect Instagram account. Co-captain of the water polo team, senior class treasurer, and trust fund baby...it's not a good idea to cross E.J. if you get something he wants — like the lead in the musical.

Dara Renee (Kourtney) – Los Angeles-born and Baltimore-raised, Renee' has entertainment in her genes. Since the age of 11, Renee' has studied at her and her mom's performing arts studio, ""Encouraging Youth to Dream."" She recently starred as Savannah in Disney Channel's Original Movie ""Freaky Friday,"" has guest starred on ABC's ""The Kids Are Alright"" and recently landed the recurring role of Stunts on the hit ABC show ""black-ish."" Renee' plays the role of Kourtney, Nini's ride-or-die best friend who's obsessed with makeup tutorials and feminism in equal measure. Kourtney works on the costume crew of ""High School Musical,"" pulling together runway-ready fashion on a high school budget.

Julia Lester (Ashlyn) – Los Angeles native Julia Lester has been working professionally since the age of five. Some of her television credits include recurring roles on the comedy ""Mom,"" ""Prince of Peoria"" and ""Mr. Student Body President."" She has performed in dozens of local and regional musical productions including ""Carrie: The Musical"" and ""Next to Normal."" Lester plays E.J.'s cousin, Ashlyn, an ""old soul"" who worships Sara Bareilles and is an aspiring songwriter on the sly.

Frankie A. Rodriguez (Carlos) – Rodriguez has worked in television and film for the last four years and can be seen in the guest-starring role of Eduardo on ABC's ""Modern Family."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodriguez plays Carlos — captain of the color guard and the student choreographer for the show. Carlos thinks of Miss Jenn as a peer. He eats lunch in her office, has been drinking espresso since the 3rd grade and already has his Tony Awards speech memorized.

Larry Saperstein (Big Red) – Born and raised in Long Island, New York, Saperstein acted opposite Kiernan Shipka in the film ""Fan Girl"" and will guest star in an upcoming episode of BET's ""The First Wives Club."" A skater boy through and through, Big Red is the spiritual cousin of both Bill and Ted: always fuzzy and he's been sleep-deprived since preschool. Big Red is weirdly devastated by Ricky and Nini's breakup — his surest role is as their wisecracking third wheel.

Mark St. Cyr (Mr. Mazzara) – A Louisiana native and an alumna of the ABC Diversity Showcase, St. Cyr's credits include the film ""Marshall"" opposite Chadwick Boseman and Jussie Smollett, and the critically acclaimed ""Doomsday."" He also guest starred on ""Chicago P.D."" and ""After After Party."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" St. Cyr plays Mr. Mazzara, East High's somewhat robotic S.T.E.M. teacher. His belief in preparing students for the future often leads him to butt heads with Miss Jenn, who would rather sing about life than live in the real world.

Now in production in Salt Lake City, Utah, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series is developed and executive produced by Tim Federle (Ferdinand) with showrunner and executive producer Oliver Goldstick (Pretty Little Liars). Also on board as executive producers are original High School Musical trilogy producers Bill Borden and Barry Rosenbush.

Other talent on the series include choreographer Zach Woodlee (Glee) and film, television and music video director Tamra Davis (Empire, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend).

High School Musical: The Musical: The Series will feature brand new songs and acoustic “rehearsal-room” reinterpretations of songs from the original Disney Channel Original Movie.

“The challenge we handed the creative team was Herculean. How do you recapture the joy and the magic of the original High School Musical movie… and simultaneously reimagine it completely?” said Gary Marsh, president and chief creative officer, Disney Channels Worldwide, in a press release.

“That’s like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded. And Tim and Oliver — and this amazingly talented and diverse cast and crew – have done exactly that!”

“We are truly excited about this extremely talented cast and the fresh and contemporary take on this globally beloved franchise,” said Agnes Chu, senior vice president of content, Disney+.

“From the music and dance, to the characters and hilarious meta references, there is something here for fans of the originals, as well as people who are new to East High. It’s going to be an unforgettable viewing experience for Disney+ subscribers.”

Disney+ is due to launch late 2019.

The investigation into actor Jussie Smollett’s account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack has taken another twist after Chicago police said two men arrested over the case are also black.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two were arrested for “probable cause” of committing assault and battery on the Empire star but had not been charged.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about exactly what police found.

His comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off.

Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Mr Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence.

He said police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he did not want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he did not remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see”.

He also said he did not initially want to give police his mobile phone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

The series is developed and executive produced by Tim Federle (""Ferdinand""), alongside showrunner and executive producer Oliver Goldstick (""Pretty Little Liars,"" ""Ugly Betty""). Bill Borden and BARRY Rosenbush (the original ""High School Musical"" trilogy) are also executive producers. Sundance Film Festival-nominated film, television and music video director Tamra Davis (""Empire,"" ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"") is directing the first three episodes. The choreographer is Zach Woodlee (""Glee,"" ""Dumplin'"").

The 10-episode series picks up nearly 15 years after the original movie aired at the real-life location where it all began: East High. It follows a group of students as they countdown to the opening night of their school's first-ever production of ""High School Musical."" Showmances blossom; friendships are tested while new ones are made; rivalries flare and lives are changed forever as these young people discover the transformative power that only a high school drama club can provide.

Brand-new songs and acoustic ""rehearsal room"" reinterpretations of songs from the original ""High School Musical"" provide the soundtrack for an unlikely group of theater kids who learn ""we're all in this together"" when it comes to pulling off an against-all-odds opening night.

""The challenge we handed the creative team was Herculean. How do you recapture the joy and the magic of the original 'High School Musical' movie ... and simultaneously reimagine it completely?"" said Gary Marsh, president and chief creative officer, Disney Channels Worldwide. ""That's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. And Tim and Oliver-and this amazingly talented and diverse cast and crew-have done exactly that!""

""We are truly excited about this extremely talented cast and the fresh and contemporary take on this globally-beloved franchise,"" said Agnes Chu, senior vice president of content, Disney+. ""From the music and dance to the characters and hilarious meta references, there is something here for fans of the originals, as well as people who are new to East High. It's going to be an unforgettable viewing experience for Disney+ subscribers.""

Joining Joshua Bassett (previously announced), the multitalented cast includes Olivia Rodrigo (""Bizaardvark""), Kate Reinders (""Modern Family,"" Broadway's ""Beautiful: The Carole King Musical""), Sofia Wylie (""Andi Mack""), Matt Cornett (""Bella and the Bulldogs""), Dara Reneé (""Freaky Friday""), Julia Lester (""Mom""), Frankie Rodriguez (""Modern Family""), Larry Saperstein (""Fan Girl""), and Mark St. Cyr (""Doomsday"").

""High School Musical: The Musical: The Series"" cast includes the following:

Joshua Bassett (Ricky) - Basset is an 18-year-old actor and songwriter from Oceanside, California. He had a recurring role on Disney Channel's ""Stuck in the Middle,"" recently guest starred on ""Dirty John"" and can currently be seen in a recurring role on ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy."" Bassett plays Ricky, a sarcastic yet charismatic skate rat and high school junior who launches a bold plan to prove himself to his ex-girlfriend Nini-by auditioning to star opposite her in the school's first-ever production of ""High School Musical: the Musical.""

Olivia Rodrigo (Nini) - Born and raised in Temecula, California, Rodrigo has been singing, playing music and acting since she was age six. She most recently starred in Disney Channel's comedy ""Bizaardvark."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodrigo plays Nini, just returned from summer theater camp where she found her voice, her confidence-and her new boyfriend. Fiercely loyal to her two moms, Nini is a star ... if she can just believe in herself long enough to stay put in the spotlight.

Kate Reinders (Miss Jenn) - A stage, film and television actress, Reinders was a series regular on ABC's ""Work It"" and Lifetime's ""Sherri."" She guest starred on ABC's ""Modern Family"" and ""Ugly Betty."" Her theatre roles include Broadway productions of ""Meteor Shower,"" ""Something Rotten!,"" ""Wicked,"" Sam Mendes' revival of ""Gypsy"" and ""Beautiful, the Carole King Musical."" Her ""High School Musical: The Musical"" character, Miss Jenn, is the school's new high-energy, low-reality drama teacher, who believes musicals can save lives. She may suffer from serious imposter syndrome, but she would do anything for her students, even if it means fudging a few credits on her C.V.

Sofia Wylie (Gina) - Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Wylie has a starring role in Disney Channel's critically acclaimed series ""Andi Mack,"" and most recently made her musical debut with ""Side by Side,"" part of the ""Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts"" special. She is recording her debut single, which should be out in late 2019. Wylie is also THE VOICE of Riri Williams in the ""Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron"" animation series and just made her big screen debut with a leading title in Marvista's ""Back of the Net."" Her character, Gina, is a recent transfer student and a diehard theater kid with as many skeletons in the closet as she has credits on her résumé. She is both ambitious and entitled, and dead set on showing Miss Jenn that she made a huge mistake in casting her as the understudy.

Matt Cornett (E.J.) - Born in Rogers, Arkansas, Cornett had a recurring role on ""Bella and The Bulldogs"" and guest starred on ABC's ""The Middle,"" ""Southland"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" among others. He will play E.J., Nini's new love interest and the supremely confident son of two CORPORATE lawyers, who secretly battle the pressures of living up to his picture-perfect Instagram account. Co-captain of the water polo team, senior class treasurer, and TRUST fund baby ... it's not a good idea to cross E.J. if you get something he wants-like the lead in the musical.

Dara Reneé (Kourtney) - Los Angeles-born and Baltimore-raised, Reneé has entertainment in her genes. Since the age of 11, Reneé has studied at her and her mom's performing arts studio, ""Encouraging Youth to Dream."" She recently starred as Savannah in Disney Channel's Original Movie ""Freaky Friday,"" has guest starred on ABC's ""The Kids Are Alright"" and recently landed the recurring role of Stunts on the hit ABC show ""black-ish."" Reneé plays the role of Kourtney, Nini's ride-or-die best friend who's obsessed with makeup tutorials and feminism in equal measure. Kourtney works on the costume crew of ""High School Musical,"" pulling together runway-ready fashion on a high school budget.

Julia Lester (Ashlyn) - Los Angeles native Julia Lester has been working professionally since the age of five. Some of her television credits include recurring roles on the comedies ""Mom,"" ""Prince of Peoria"" and ""Mr. Student Body President."" She has performed in dozens of local and regional musical productions including ""Carrie: The Musical"" and ""Next to Normal."" Lester plays E.J.'s cousin Ashlyn, an ""old soul"" who worships Sara Bareilles and is an aspiring songwriter on the sly.

Frankie A. Rodriguez (Carlos) - Rodriguez has worked in television and film for the last four years and can be seen in the guest-starring role of Eduardo on ABC's ""Modern Family."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodriguez plays Carlos, captain of the color guard and the student choreographer for the show. Carlos thinks of Miss Jenn as a peer. He eats lunch in her office, has been drinking espresso since the 3rd grade and already has his Tony Awards® speech memorized.

Larry Saperstein (Big Red) - Born and raised in Long Island, New York, Saperstein acted opposite Kiernan Shipka in the film ""Fan Girl"" and will guest star in an upcoming episode of BET's ""The First Wives Club."" A skater boy through and through, Big Red is the spiritual cousin of both Bill and Ted-always fuzzy and he's been sleep-deprived since preschool. Big Red is weirdly devastated by Ricky and Nini's breakup. His surest role is as their wisecracking third wheel.

Mark St. Cyr (Mr. Mazzara) - A Louisiana native and an alumna of the ABC Diversity Showcase, St. Cyr's credits include the film ""Marshall,"" opposite Chadwick Boseman and Jussie Smollett, and the critically acclaimed ""Doomsday."" He also guest starred on ""Chicago P.D."" and ""After After Party."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" St. Cyr plays Mr. Mazzara, East High's somewhat robotic S.T.E.M. teacher. His belief in preparing students for the future often leads him to butt heads with Miss Jenn, who would rather sing about life than live in the real world.

Two potential suspects in the alleged racial attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett have been arrested, Chicago police said Friday.



Police clarified that the two men were placed under arrest Wednesday night after police met them at the airport.

They have not yet been charged, police said.



""Police can detain the potential suspects for an additional 24 hours past the 48 hour holding period under special circumstances, but it must go through the prosecutors office and has to be clear process,"" police added to ABC News.



Police also confirmed that “they have a relationship with [Jussie].”



This news comes hours after police told ABC News they were classifying them as potential suspects.



""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police said.



They also shut down any reports that there was evidence to classify the alleged attack as a hoax.



""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,"" police added. ""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

Chicago PD had confirmed Thursday that they identified and were questioning the two ""persons of interest"" in the alleged racial attack. One of them has previously appeared on ""Empire,"" according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.



Police say they were tracking the two suspects and were aware of who they were ""for a while,"" and that investigators learned that the two individuals were returning to Chicago on Wednesday from Nigeria.



The two suspects are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, they added.

Two men have been arrested in connection to a hate crime attack reported by actor Jussie Smollett.

The Chicago Police department said Friday that the men arrested were the same men that police previously said were being viewed as ‘potential suspects.

The men, who police said were arrested Wednesday, have not been charged.

Earlier on Friday, a spokesperson for the police said two Nigerian brothers were being treated as ‘potential suspects’ and that detectives had ‘probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime’.

Authorities have not indicated exactly what the brothers are accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

Reports later claimed the two men in question ‘beat the actor up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.’

‘Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,’ the spokesperson said in Friday’s statement. ‘While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.’

‘The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,’ they added.

TMZ previous reported that Jussie is being questioned by Chicago police again, as well as a man, an actor who also appeared on Empire,

Sources connected to the case told the publication that the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD on Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport.

The website reports that Jussie was brought in on Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare is also reported to have been taken in for questioning.

The two individuals are being questioned as ‘persons of interest’.

A rep for Jussie told Metro.co.uk: ‘Jussie answered routine questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to be cooperative.’

Jussie, meanwhile, said he is ‘pissed off’ in his first TV interview since the attack took place.

He appeared on Good Morning America and vented his frustration at those doubting his attack and claiming details of his ordeal have been ‘fabricated’.

‘I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.

‘You know, at first it was a thing of, “Listen if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

‘And then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”‘

US authorities had previously said only that the two men, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on January 29th.

“Detectives have probable cause that they [the two men] may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay black American who plays a gay character on hip-hop drama Empire, caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men questioned by police know Smollett from working on Empire and were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

But Porterfield, in fact, joined a long legacy of right-wing evangelicals who have conflated legal protections for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people with white supremacy and domestic terrorism.

The Southern Baptist Convention in 2012 resolved that “homosexual rights activists” had “misappropriated the rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement” in advocating for marriage equality and other legal protections.

Bryan Fischer, former director of issues analysis for the American Family Association, has compared LGBT people to Nazis numerous times, arguing in a 2010 column that “homosexuality gave us Adolph [sic] Hitler.”

And Tony Perkins, president of the Christian conservative lobbying group the Family Research Council, argued in a 2018 column on the organization’s website that marriage equality was really “about obliterating every moral and cultural boundary humans have ever known.”

“The LGBTQ is suppressing the freedom of people that disagree with them and forcing their ideology,” Porterfield told Rachel Anderson, a reporter and weekend anchor with the Bluefield, West Virginia, TV station WVVA, in a separate interview.

“If they do not get their way, they cause chaos, apply pressure, intimidate, internet stalk,” he added. “They’re the most evil-spreading and hate-filled group in this country.”

Porterfield’s comments came after a controversial rant in a legislative committee meeting, during which lawmakers were debating a bill to add protections to the state’s housing and employment nondiscrimination law for sexual orientation and gender identity.

His broader claim that “the LGBTQ” are harming America by lobbying for equal protections under the law is not new either. It’s right out of the right-wing evangelical playbook, according to Randall Balmer, an Episcopal priest and historian whose work studying the religious right has been recognized with numerous accolades, including an Emmy nomination for script-writing and hosting the PBS documentary based on his book, “Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory.”

Balmer said that right-wing evangelical leaders often rely on a “rhetoric of victimization” to make themselves seem persecuted in the face of changing social norms.

“That, by the way, is one of the reasons that they embrace Trump…he’s very good at this rhetoric of victimization,” Balmer said. “What this guy in West Virginia is saying is just a variant on this. ‘We’re the ones who are under siege, we’re the ones who have some sort of grievance that needs to be redressed.’”

But even given this context, Porterfield’s comparison of LGBT people with the KKK is a strange one, given the religious right’s origins. Although many believe abortion had a central role in pushing evangelical leaders toward politics, pro-life rhetoric did not become important in those circles until well past the 1970s.

In a Politico Magazine piece, Balmer traces the beginnings of the evangelical right’s political efforts to a court case in the late 1960s, when a group of Black parents in Holmes, Mississippi, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department in hopes of preventing segregated private K-12 schools from receiving full tax-exempt status. As the Internal Revenue Status targeted the tax exempt status of private, segregated primary and secondary schools, leaders like the late Jerry Falwell became involved in the fight. “In some states it’s easier to open a massage parlor than to open a Christian school,” Falwell is quoted as saying at the time in an article in The Nation exploring the preacher’s racist roots.

The racism exhibited by leaders of the evangelical right at the time was not limited to their efforts to preserve whites-only Christian academies. Tony Perkins, the aforementioned president of the Family Research Council, had no problem associating with the KKK when he served in Louisiana’s House of Representatives. He even spent time with David Duke, a former grand wizard for the white supremacist hate group.

“The religious right has its roots in racism, I’m sorry to say,” Balmer said. “So for this guy to kind of call on that trope is both ironic, but also fully compatible with the history of this movement.”

Heather Warren, a University of Virginia religion professor who studies American religious history, agreed with Balmer, adding that racism and Christianity were intertwined not just in evangelical movements, but in “hardcore KKK ideology.” Warren, who is also an Episcopal priest, said that in the 1950s and ‘60s, leaders in the religious right were fighting not to make America great again, but “to keep America Christian.”

“And Christian and white and democracy all went together,” she said. “They were all interchangeable. There was this way that it all added up to a white supremacy.”

So laws and ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are a direct affront to democracy, Warren said, and an attack on democracy is synonymous with an attack on white Christianity and America, under this belief system.

“When Falwell was alive and writing, usually in his catalogue of phenomena and types of people who were eroding America and eroding American democracy, he’d often start off with homosexuals at the top of his list,” Warren said. “Feminists were close behind.”

It’s a convenient leap to make if you want to demonize the continued push for increased LGBT rights, which Porterfield seems to think are somehow wholly separate from the gay community. He clarified in his interview with Anderson that his original statement was an “anti-LGBTQ sentiment,” not an “anti-gay sentiment.”

Even before taking office, Porterfield made his positions on issues that directly impact the LGBT community clear. In a December interview, Porter condemned efforts to outlaw conversion therapy in West Virginia, a practice opposed by every major credible psychology or psychiatry organization. Porterfield called efforts to ban the practice “bigoted and discriminatory” and that the counseling practice should be protected as free speech.

Historically, conversion therapy methods have relied on tactics like castration, induced vomiting and electroshock therapy to “cure” LGBT people. While the unscientific and unethical therapeutic method has been banned or condemned in a number of states, including California and Washington State, New York is the only Appalachian state so far to outlaw it.

Porterfield’s comments, both before taking office and since, make it clear that he believes being criticized for bigotry is on par with a legacy of racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic violence rooted in white supremacy and white Christianity. By making this comparison, he’s dismissing that Black and LGBT Americans have faced far worse than a few mean comments online.

The KKK was infamous for carrying out lynchings against Black Americans, a hate crime that often involves hanging but often also can include being burned alive or shot multiple times. The 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard’s, a gay college student from Wyoming who was beaten and left to die tied to a fencepost,is sometimes considered a lynching, and the history of lynching was painfully brought up for many Black LGBT Americans recently when Jussie Smollett, a Black gay actor, was assaulted by two men in Chicago who put a noose around his neck.

There’s hope, however, for Balmer in the form of younger white evangelicals who might not share Porterfield’s extreme beliefs.

“Not that his views are unique, and not that his vitriol is unique,” Balmer said. “But I think it’s changing, and much of it is generational.”

Balmer says young evangelicals are already showing they’re more concerned about issues like ending widespread hunger and poverty than whether someone is trans or attracted to a person of the same gender. Hopefully, he says, one day these young people will refuse to back other politicians like Porterfield and focus their efforts on finding solutions for struggling communities.

Police in Chicago have arrested two men in connection with the alleged Jan. 29 attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, according to media reports.

TMZ reports that the men — who have connections to the Fox drama series — have been booked for battery, although at the time of the report they apparently had yet to be formally charged.

“The men are brothers from Nigeria named Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, and Chicago cops are now calling them ‘potential suspects’ … as opposed to persons of interest,” TMZ reports. “We know it was their home cops raided Wednesday and seized a long list of potential evidence … including several bottles of bleach.”

The men, who go by the nicknames Ola and Abel, have come up as figures in the story of the Smollett attack since they were picked up for questioning Wednesday night at O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria. According to The New York Post, police revealed today that the brothers were arrested at that time and have been held since then.

“The beefy brothers, who describe themselves as actors and models, have links to ‘Empire’ — Ola played a prison inmate on season 2 of the hit Fox series, while Abel says he’s also worked on the show,” The Post reports.

It is unclear how well the brothers and Smollett know each other. Ola reportedly also recently had a part on “Chicago PD.”

Police have not confirmed that the Osundairo brothers are the same men seen in a grainy photo released from surveillance footage. Smollett has said he believes the men in the photo are his attackers. You can click here to see that photo.

“A Chicago law enforcement source tells us the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits,” TMZ reports. “This raises a potential problem because … Jussie initially said his attackers were white and yelled ‘MAGA country.'” The report adds that the Osundairos “just don’t fit that profile.”

The Post report notes that authorities have 48 hours from the time of the arrests to issue charges against the men being held, which means if it’s going to happen it can be expected to take place sometime today.

Feb 15 (Reuters) - Suspects arrested in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago were released on Friday, police said.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

Chicago Police officers arrested two brothers in conjunction with the alleged assault on Empire star, Jussie Smollett.

According to reports, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were picked up by Chicago Polic Department officers, who had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.” Though initial reports identified Smollett’s attackers as two white men, the Abimbola brothers are Nigerian.

The men were arrested by local police at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, and are being held for questioning. They have yet to be charged.

On Jan. 29, Chicago Police released a statement saying Smollett had been assaulted by two men, who put a rope around his neck, and threw a chemical substance in his face. Afterwards, reports claimed the men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who once appeared on Empire as extras, have denied the allegations, but police are continuing to investigate.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

A lawyer for the brothers told CBS 2 that her clients could be charged on Friday. “They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m.,” lawyer Gloria Schmidt said. “They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then.”

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” she continued.

Schmidt confirmed to CBS 2 that the brothers were extras on Empire and went to the gym with Smollett.

“They are really baffled why they are people of interest,” the lawyer said. “They really don’t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they are not guilty of it.”

Chicago police Anthony Guglielmi on Thursday said detectives were questioning the two individuals — but said neither of them were “considered suspects at this time.”

According to Guglielmi, the brothers were seen on surveillance cameras in the neighborhood where the alleged incident took place.

The developments come as law enforcement continues to investigate the case, which began with Smollett telling police two masked individuals shouted racist and homophobic insults at him and sprayed him with an unknown chemical substance on January 29. The 36-year-old also told law enforcement the alleged assailants looped a rope around his neck and shouted “This is MAGA country” before fleeing the scene."

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. Department policy prohibited him from naming the victim, he said, but he nonetheless confirmed that a pair of Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case involving the Empire cast member.

Smollett is an actor on the television drama and has claimed last month's attack was ""racist and homophobic"".

Mr Guglielmi added at least one of the men in custody worked on Empire, but he does not know in what capacity.

The pair were picked them at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after they flew from Nigeria earlier this week. Police served a search warrant at their Chicago apartment.

Authorities said earlier that the men were being questioned as potential suspects.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” Mr Guglielmi told The Independent.

Interrogations were set to resume today with the two men and their attorney.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Mr Guglielmi said. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

He added that police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

Smollett alleged that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country”, referencing Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, but he told ABC News eaelier this week that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing MAGA hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see”.

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

CHICAGO — The investigation into “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took another turn Friday when Chicago police said two men who had been questioned about the attack have been arrested on suspicion of a crime.

Police did not say what crime they may have committed, and they have not been charged, but spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police consider them to be suspects in the attack.

The two men — whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria when police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not give any information about what exactly police found.

Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while getting food at a restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence.

The two Nigerian brothers being questioned over the Jussie Smollett attack are actors Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal.

The pair were picked up by police at Chicago O’Hare Airport on Wednesday as they arrived back in America after visiting family in Nigeria to be questioned over the January 29 attack involving the star.

Family say they went to Africa on January 29, hours after the Smollett attack. Ola appeared on Empire in 2015 and both brothers have had minor roles on Chicago PD.

Smollett follows their joint Instagram account and, according to their lawyer, sometimes goes to the gym with them.

DailyMail.com has identified photographs of one of the brothers inside the gym in Smollett’s apartment building in June. The gym is private to residents of the luxury condominium building.

On Thursday night, the star was accused by anonymous police sources cited by local networks of staging the attack.

The sources accused Smollett of orchestrating the hoax because he was being written out of the show and wanted to drum up publicity to save his role — a claim that has been strenuously denied by the show and uncorroborated by the police department.

In his reports to police, Smollett says he was attacked by two assailants whose facial features he could not make out but that it was a racist, homophobic ambush during which they called him ‘Empire f****t n****r’ and shouted: ‘This is MAGA country!’

The brothers’ names are also included on a list of evidence that was left at their home after Chicago PD officers ransacked it on Thursday and the pair are listed in public records as the tenants of that house.

They have not been charged and are their lawyer insists they are not the people who attacked Jussie, revealing that the three are friends who sometimes work out together.

Police on Friday however said they were now being treated as ‘potential suspects’ instead of ‘persons of interest’.

‘The two individuals interviewed are classfied (sic) as potential suspects.

‘Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,’ Anthony Guglielmi, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, said in a statement.

Before returning to the US on Wednesday, they shared photographs and videos on Instagram of their time in Nigeria.

Neither has been charged and Chicago Police Department has until 5.45pm on Friday to arrest them or release them.

The brothers’ lawyer Gloria Schmidt spoke out on Thursday to say they were ‘baffled’ by the allegations against them and that they are innocent.

‘They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m.

‘They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then,’ Gloria Schmidt, the pair’s lawyer, told CBS Chicago on Thursday night.

‘When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified.

‘This is someone they know.

‘This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.

‘They are really baffled why they are people of interest.

‘They really don’t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they are not guilty of it,’ she said.

TMZ reported that detectives found the men by looking at ride-sharing history records from the night of the attack.

Smollett, 36, says he was attacked by two men on January 29 as he walked home from a Subway at 2am.

He has since said he believes he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of President Trump and that he would have had more public support if he had said his attackers were ‘black, Muslim or Mexican’.

While Chicago PD will not confirm on the record that the two men being questioned are the two black actors, they did tell DailyMail.com on Thursday that they are the men who were seen in surveillance camera footage walking near the area of the attack at around the same time.

Smollett said on Thursday that he had ‘no doubt’ the people in the video were who punched him, tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

He said the attack, which only lasted around 30 seconds, included them saying: ‘This is MAGA country!’ and calling him ‘Empire f****t n****r’.

On Thursday, the show issued a statement to deny that Jussie was being written out of the show.

‘The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous.

‘He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,’ it said.

Chicago police also would not confirm that it was a hoax.

‘Interviews will resume today with the two people of interest and their attorney.

‘While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack.

‘There is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as the victim, not a suspect.

‘The investigation continues,’ Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago PD spokesman, said on Friday.

Police seized a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items from the home where the brothers live.

The relative, who was home when the raid happened on Wednesday night, described hearing loud banging on the door before police flooded into the home and announced that they had a search warrant.

The woman, who is in her 20s, told CBS Chicago she was ‘so scared’ and thought she was going to die. She said she was patted down by an officer and asked by detectives if she knew Smollett.

She said that she thinks the brothers are being question because of their loose Empire connection to Smollett and the fact that they left for Nigeria on the same day of the attack.

In his hour-long interview with Good Morning America that was aired in part on Thursday, Smollett, wearing a collection of badges to show his support of Freedom and Pride among other causes, revealed his frustration at some of the public disbelief surrounding his version of events.

He said he does not think he would have been met with the same cynicism if his attackers weren’t Trump supporters and revealed his belief that he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of the president.

Smollett also went into detail about why he did not immediately hand over his phone to the police to verify parts of his story and said he was trying to protect private photographs, videos, songs and phone numbers of high profile people and his partner.

He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: ‘There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.’

Describing the chain of events once police arrived at his apartment at the request of 60-year-old Frank Gatson, his friend who was at the apartment when the attack took place.

‘I told them what happened. I asked them to turn their body cameras off. I was like, “Please just come in.

‘I don’t want a big scene with my neighbors,”‘ he said, adding that he had left the rope around his neck and his bleach-doused clothes on for them to see.

He said that while he left the rope around his neck, it was not ‘wrapped’ tightly.

After the police had come into his apartment, he took them down to where the attack happened to walk them through it and became excited when he noticed a camera overlooking the exact spot where it took place.

‘I looked up and saw there was a camera, directly on the post on the intersection.

‘Then the detective told me that the camera was facing north so they didn’t have it and that was disappointing.’

Later, he added how desperate he was for them to find footage of the attack.

‘I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons.

‘Number one, I want them to find the people that did it.

‘Number two, I want them to stop being able to say “alleged” attack.

‘Number three, I want them to see that I fought back,’ he continued, welling-up.

‘I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,’ I didn’t,’ he said.

He was overcome with emotion when presented with the prospect that his attackers might not be found.

‘Let’s just hope that they are found.

‘Let’s not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said,”I just hope they find them.” And she said, “Sweetie, they’re not going to find them.”"

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that the men were taken into custody as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett's story was subject to intense scrutiny as widespread reports suggested he had misled police, though officials denied any wrongdoing by the actor.

Two men were arrested in connection to a reported hate attack on ""Empire"" Jussie Smollett that occurred last month in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that two brothers of Nigerian descent were taken into custody at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men. No charges have been brought against the suspects at this time.

Chicago Police said in a statement January 30 that it was investigating a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" involving an ""Empire"" cast member, but didn't name Smollett at that time.

According to TMZ, Smollett arrived in Chicago late Monday and went to a Subway for something to eat early on Tuesday morning. As he was leaving the restaurant, two men approached him and one yelled, ""Aren't you that f----- Empire n-----?,"" sources connected to Smollett told TMZ.

The source also reportedly told TMZ that the two men were white and wearing ski masks, and after pouring bleach on Smollett, one of them yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck, according to police.

The two suspects mark a significant development in the case.

Confusion surrounding the case

Since the reported attack, multiple outlets reported that police were considering charging Smollett with making a false report if the case proves to be a hoax.

However, officer Carroll Michael denied that the police department is treating Smollett as anything but a victim, and said reports to the contrary were false.

""False report charges, huh?"" Michael told INSIDER. ""We said multiple times, he is still considered a victim.""

The case grew more confusing when a report by WLS-TV claimed that police were investigating whether or not Smollett, an openly gay actor and musician, who plays Jamal Joseph Lyon on the hit television show, staged the attack because he was being written off the television show.

In a statement sent to INSIDER, Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied the report, calling it ""patently ridiculous.""

ABC News

(CHICAGO) — Two potential suspects in the alleged racial attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have been arrested, Chicago police said Friday.

Police clarified that the two men were placed under arrest Wednesday night after police met them at the airport.

They have not yet been charged yet, police said.

“Police can detain the potential suspects for an additional 24 hours past the 48 hour holding period under special circumstances, but it must go through the prosecutor’s office and has to be clear process,” police added to ABC News.

Police also confirmed that “they have a relationship with [Jussie].”

This news comes hours after police told ABC News they were classifying them as potential suspects.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police said.

They also shut down any reports that there was evidence to classify the alleged attack as a hoax.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” police added. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Chicago PD had confirmed Thursday that they identified and were questioning the two “persons of interest” in the alleged racial attack. One of them has previously appeared on “Empire,” according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Police say they were tracking the two suspects and were aware of who they were “for a while,” and that investigators learned that the two individuals were returning to Chicago on Wednesday from Nigeria.

The two suspects are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, they added.

Detectives also questioned Smollett Thursday, the official said.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt, who is representing the two persons of interest, told Chicago CBS station WBBM that her clients were detained at O’Hare Airport Wednesday evening and were unaware of the attack on Smollett.

“When they first learned what happened to him, they were horrified,” Schmidt said. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that … They really don’t understand how [police] even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they’re not guilty of it.”

Late last month, Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s “Empire,” told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to police. Smollett said the attackers also yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said on “Good Morning America” that he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

Despite the speculation, police are not caving into reports suggesting Smollett might have staged the attack.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said in a statement to The Times on Friday. Guglielmi again denied reports alleging that the attack was a hoax and reiterated that Smollett is being treated as a victim. “While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi said. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.” (Los Angeles Times)

This week, reports emerged about Chi-Town police raiding the home of two persons of interest connected to Smollett’s attack.

Both men are Nigerian and were extras on “Empire.” Based on what the cops have already said, it appears these are the same men who were captured on the surveillance video. According to the report, police seized 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops and other items. (TMZ)

Despite speculation about Smollett possibly staging the attack, Chicago Police have not confirmed a set-up.

The station and a CBS affiliate both reported that cops suspect Smollett orchestrated the attack and enlisted the men’s help. A spokesman for the Chicago Police cast doubt on that narrative. “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said. “We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” he wrote, though the reports don’t specify the sources are law enforcement.

On Friday (Feb. 15), Chicago P.D. spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they are talking to two men and “detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

“We are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” added Guglielmi.

According to TMZ, the men are brothers from Nigeria named Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who have ties to “Empire.” Cops raided their home on Wednesday and seized potential evidence including several bottles of bleach. Ola played a prison inmate on the second season of “Empire,” while Abel also says he worked on the Fox show.

Police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the Chicago attack last month because the actor is being written off the series. However, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment have denied the report.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

On Thursday night (Feb. 14), Guglielmi said the hoax reports were “unconfirmed by case detectives,” adding that there is “no evidence to support” the claims.

Smollett told police he was attacked in the early hours of Jan. 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs. They tied a rope around his neck and doused him with a chemical substance, possibly bleach, while yelling, “This is MAGA country.”

On Thursday, Smollett appeared on “Good Morning America,” where he spoke for the first time about the alleged attack. “At first, it was like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,'” an emotional Smollett told Robin Roberts. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.'”

He also explained why he was initially hesitant to go to police. “There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,” he said. “And I’m not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.”

UPDATE: The two men arrested in connection with the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett were released without charge on Friday. They are no longer considered potential suspects.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the ‘Empire’ case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department spokesman, said in a statement."

Gregory T. Angelo, who led the LGBTQ Republican group from 2013 to 2018, argues that Pence has received a raw deal when it comes to news coverage surrounding his views on LGBTQ issues, which have cast the vice president as some kind of anti-gay zealot who is so blinded by his religious beliefs that he is eager to promote anti-LGBTQ policies.

But, Angelo writes: “There is absolutely nothing — nothing at all — in Mike Pence’s record to indicate he sees himself as a culture warrior who believes LGBT Americans are the enemy.”

Focusing on comments made by lesbian actress Ellen Page during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Angelo asserts that the vice president has been maligned in the media for his beliefs.

In the interview with Colbert, Page alleged that: Pence is opposed to gay marriage and attempted to ban it in Indiana; Pence believes in, or at least supports conversion therapy; and Pence “hurt LGBTQ people” when he was governor, an apparent allusion to his support for Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law in 2015.

But Angelo argues that all of Page’s assertions are false.

“At the root of the vice president’s erroneous mislabeling as an anti-gay extremist is Pence’s admittedly poor handling of the passage of Indiana’s version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act…” Angelo writes. “The legislation asserted that government ‘may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion’ — a rather specific law with narrow applications.

“Although similar legislation was passed at the federal level in 1993 after it was approved 97-3 in the U.S. Senate and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, liberals pounced with declarations that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would open a door to rampant discrimination,” he continues. “Opponents of the law claimed it would allow any business in Indiana to refuse service to members of the LGBT community simply by citing ‘deeply held beliefs.’ Of course, that wasn’t the case, but the false narrative spread across the nation, sparking outrage.”

Rather, Angelo says, Pence argued that the law wasn’t intended to discriminate against LGBTQ people, and eventually signed a bill clarifying that the law should not be interpreted as permitting anti-LGBTQ discrimination.

“Pence then became the first governor in Indiana history to sign protections into law based on ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity’ — hardly the actions of an anti-LGBT crusader,” writes Angelo.

As for Pence’s purported support for conversion therapy, Angelo says such charges have been exaggerated, and are based on flimsy evidence — using a misstatement by Pulse nightclub shooting survivor Brandon Wolf in which Wolf claimed Pence wanted to round up gay people and put them in “concentration camps” (he later said he had intended to say “conversion camps”) as one of the more extreme examples of how the vice president is being slandered.

In 2000, Pence’s congressional campaign website states that he supported reauthorizing Ryan White HIV/AIDS funding only if resources were “directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”

But Angelo says people have made a huge assumption from a rather benign statement issued almost two decades ago.

“Changing one’s ‘sexual behavior’ is far different than changing one’s ‘sexual orientation,'” Angelo writes. “In fact, at the time of Pence’s proclamation, LGBT advocates were working to promote safer sexual behaviors themselves with condom distribution programs and public education campaigns about HIV transmission.”

Angelo also points to Pence’s enthusiastic reaction to President Trump’s call to eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States by 2030, and his support of openly gay Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, as further evidence that the vice president is being unfairly maligned.

“Despite the continued wails of liberals intent on keeping the lie alive about his supposed homophobia, Mike Pence has acted with grace, a spirit of inclusion, and a commitment to be a vice president for all Americans,” Angelo concludes.

But Drew Anderson, a spokesman for GLAAD and a native Hoosier who previously worked for the Indiana Democratic Party, says that Angelo’s praise of Pence’s record is nothing but spin.

“The one thing you need to know about Mike Pence is his ideology will trump common sense, and any sort of PR crisis, any time,” Anderson says. “It appears that Angelo is cherry-picking what he wants people to see.”

Specifically, Anderson points to Pence’s refusal to allow clean needle exchanges — a stance he later reversed, but which exacerbated the HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users in rural Indiana — as a time when ideology trumped public health concerns.

But Anderson also cites the same statement from Pence’s 2000 campaign website — which Angelo used to defend the vice president from charges he is anti-gay — as evidence of his rigid ideology, as Pence was not in favor of renewing Ryan White HIV/AIDS funding unless money was also spent on efforts to curb certain sexual behaviors.

While Anderson concedes that “sexual behavior” and “sexual orientation” are not synonymous, he argues that many on the right end of the political spectrum have failed to make such a distinction over the years.

Therefore, based on historical context, at the time when the statement was issued, therapy to curbing or change “sexual behavior” was often interpreted as changing “sexual orientation.”

Anderson notes that Pence’s record in Congress is available for anyone to access. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Pence voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, voted against the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages.

“I’m a little baffled how [Angelo] comes up with this idea that Mike Pence is not anti-LGBTQ,” he says. “And that’s just in Congress. We’re not even talking about the fact that Mike Pence supported RFRA. We’re not talking about HJR 3, an amendment in 2014 that would have added a ban on marriage equality into Indiana’s constitution. Mike Pence not only supported it, he went to events that promoted that amendment.”

With regard to Angelo’s argument that Indiana’s RFRA law was narrowly tailored, Anderson contends that it was overly broad, and went far beyond the scope of the 1993 federal RFRA, which was intended to protect religious minorities.

He points to the controversy over Memories Pizza, the since-shuttered pizza shop in Walkerton, Ind., whose owners claimed that the RFRA law permitted them to refuse service to same-sex couples, as an example of how the law was much more aggressive in what it interprets as “religious freedom” than the federal law.

“The argument that Gregory tries to make, comparing Indiana’s RFRA to the one signed by Bill Clinton, is so out-of-touch and outdated, that I wish he had done more digging to find the truth,” Anderson says.

Additionally, he notes, while Pence and Republicans in the legislature eventually passed a “fix” to the RFRA law to clarify that it shouldn’t be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people, the language in the bill is not binding.

To this day, there is no law in Indiana that explicitly prohibits anti-LGBTQ discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodations.

“The only reason the clause was added to the ‘fix’ was to stop the PR crisis that Mike Pence and Republicans were having in that state,” says Anderson. “It’s a clause that cannot be backed up in court because the state’s [civil rights law] does not include sexual orientation or gender identity.”

Angelo did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking a response to Anderson’s assertions."

The men arrested were the same men that police previously said were being viewed as ""potential suspects,"" according to Tom Ahern, Chicago police communications deputy director.

Earlier Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said two Nigerian brothers were being treated as ""potential suspects"" and that detectives had ""probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

Police did not say at that time precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

Smollett, one of the stars of Empire, told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who lobbed ""racial and homophobic slurs"" at him.

After a brief struggle, both men ran away, and Smollett told police that one attacker had allegedly put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

""Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,"" Guglielmi said in Saturday's statement. ""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.""

""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" he added.

Police said Friday they were questioning the two men after meeting them at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, but they were not considered suspects at that time. Their apartment was searched by police earlier this week.

One of the brothers has appeared on the show Empire, according to police.

Authorities previously released surveillance images of two silhouetted figures in the area of the attack, who they said were wanted for questioning.

Smollett shared his detailed account of the alleged attack in a Friday morning interview on Good Morning America, in which he rejected reports that he said he told police the attackers wore Make America Great Again hats.

So this Jussie Smollett hate crime attack story just got a little more interesting.

Chicago police reportedly identified the two Nigerian men who were detained this week as persons of interest in the alleged attack as brothers Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo.

Abel and Ola were reportedly taken into custody on Wednesday (Feb. 13) at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport not long after they arrived on a flight from Nigeria, where they had recently been “vacationing” since the attack. Coincidentally, they hopped on a plane to Nigeria the same day of the incident.

Police are now calling the brothers “potential suspects” and they both were arrested Friday in connection with the alleged hate attack. They haven’t been charged yet, but it’s likely they’ll be booked for some form of assault/battery.

According to online reports, the Osundairo brothers—who are both actors—worked as extras on the Chicago set of Empire.

Police sources said cops linked the brothers to Smollett and the show’s creator Lee Daniels through online phone records. One of the brothers even appeared in a photo shared by Daniels on social media in 2015 on the set of an Empire episode.

On top of that, Jussie Smollett follows at least one of the brothers on Instagram, and, according to their lawyer, Smollett sometimes goes to the gym with them.

The video below appears to show one of the brothers walking upside down on a treadmill in the gym at Smollett’s building.

We reported last night that some Chicago police officials were suggesting that the actor/singer staged his highly publicized hate crime attack because he was being written off “Empire.”

A spokesman for Chicago police said those reports weren’t true and they will continue to treat Jussie Smollett as a victim in the investigation.

Reps for Smollett also denied the reports that he was being written off Empire, and Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Police, however, now say they have “probable cause” that the Osundairo brothers were involved in the January 29th attack, in which Smollett claims he was punched and called racist and gay slurs by two masked men who shouted “This is MAGA country!” The Empire star also said the men poured an unknown “chemical substance,” possibly beach, on him and put a noose around his neck.

The brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, insists they had nothing to do with Jussie’s alleged attack.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” she told CBS News on Friday. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She added: “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with. So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Chicago police raided the Abel and Ola Osundairo’s house Wednesday night, and a relative who was at the home said police took bleach, a “black facemask hat,” an “Empire” script, shoes, electronics, receipts, and other items.

The woman, who was patted down by an officer and asked if she knows Smollett personally, said she thinks police picked the two brothers up for questioning because of their loose connection to Smollett, and the fact that they left for Nigeria the same day of the attack. Their attorney said they were visiting family and the timing is simply a coincidence.

Good Morning America aired an interview with Jussie Smollett Sunday in which the actor called the rumors he’s heard about the night, like speculation that his attack was a homosexual date gone wrong, “offensive.”

Smollett also said he was “pissed off” because he didn’t understand why some people don’t believe he was really attacked.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

He added: “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

When GMA host Robin Roberts asked Smollett how he would feel is attackers were never caught, he got very emotional and said he hopes footage showing the attack in detail is found and released so that people can stop using the word “alleged” to describe the incident."

Production is underway in Salt Lake City, Utah on Disney+'s upcoming TV series, High School Musical: The Musical, inspired by the movie phenom.

""The 10-episode series picks up nearly 15 years after the original movie aired, at the real-life location where it all began: East High,"" according to a presser for Disney's new streaming service.

The movie follows ""a group of students as they count down to opening night of their school's first-ever production of High School Musical. Show-mances blossom; friendships are tested while new ones are made; rivalries flare; and lives are changed forever as these young people discover the transformative power that only a high school drama club can provide.""

Expect to hear brand-new songs and reinterpretations of the classics fans fell in love with from the Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens-starring films.

""We are truly excited about this extremely talented cast and the fresh and contemporary take on this globally beloved franchise,” said Agnes Chu, senior vice president of content, Disney+. ""From the music and dance, to the characters and hilarious meta references, there is something here for fans of the originals, as well as people who are new to East High. It’s going to be an unforgettable viewing experience for Disney+ subscribers.""

Meet the cast below:

Joshua Bassett (Ricky) – Basset is an 18 year-old actor and songwriter from Oceanside, California. He had a recurring role on Disney Channel's ""Stuck in the Middle,"" recently guest starred on ""Dirty John"" and can currently be seen in a recurring role on ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy."" Bassett plays Ricky, a sarcastic yet charismatic skate rat and high school junior, who launches a bold plan to prove himself to his ex-girlfriend Nini — by auditioning to star opposite her in the school's first-ever production of ""High School Musical: the Musical.""

Olivia Rodrigo (Nini) – Born and raised in Temecula, California, Rodrigo has been singing, playing music and acting since she was age six. She most recently starred in Disney Channel's comedy ""Bizaardvark."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodrigo plays Nini, who just returned from summer theater camp after finding her voice, her confidence — and her new boyfriend. Fiercely loyal to her two moms, Nini is a star — if she can just believe in herself long enough to stay put in the spotlight.

Kate Reinders (Miss Jenn) – A stage, film and television actress, Reinders was a series regular on ABC's ""Work It"" and Lifetime's ""Sherri"" and guest starred on ""Modern Family"" and ""Ugly Betty."" Her theatre roles include Broadway productions of ""Meteor Shower,"" ""Something Rotten!,"" ""Wicked,"" Sam Mendes' revival of ""Gypsy"" and ""Beautiful, the Carole King Musical."" Her ""High School Musical: The Musical"" character, Miss Jenn, is the school's new high-energy, low-reality drama teacher, who believes musicals can save lives. She may suffer from serious imposter syndrome, but she would do anything for her students, even if it means fudging a few credits on her C.V.

Sofia Wylie (Gina) – Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Wylie has a starring role in Disney Channel's critically-acclaimed series ""Andi Mack"" and most recently made her musical debut with ""Side by Side,"" part of the ""Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts"" special. She is recording her debut single which should be out late 2019. Wylie is also the voice of Riri Williams in the ""Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron"" animation series and just made her big screen debut with a leading title in Marvista's ""Back of the Net."" Her character, Gina, is a recent transfer student and a diehard theater kid with as many skeletons in the closet as she has credits on her résumé. She is both ambitious and entitled, and dead set on showing Miss Jenn that she made a huge mistake in casting her as the understudy.

Matt Cornett (E.J.) – Born in Rogers, Arkansas, Cornett had a recurring role on ""Bella and The Bulldogs"" and guest starred on ""The Middle,"" ""Southland"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" among others. He will play E.J., Nini's new love interest, the supremely confident son of two corporate lawyers, who secretly battles the pressure of living up to his picture-perfect Instagram account. Co-captain of the water polo team, senior class treasurer, and trust fund baby...it's not a good idea to cross E.J. if you get something he wants — like the lead in the musical.

Dara Renee' (Kourtney) – Los Angeles-born and Baltimore-raised, Renee' has entertainment in her genes. Since the age of 11, Renee' has studied at her and her mom's performing arts studio, ""Encouraging Youth to Dream."" She recently starred as Savannah in Disney Channel's Original Movie ""Freaky Friday,"" has guest starred on ABC's ""The Kids Are Alright"" and recently landed the recurring role of Stunts on the hit ABC show ""black-ish."" Renee' plays the role of Kourtney, Nini's ride-or-die best friend who's obsessed with makeup tutorials and feminism in equal measure. Kourtney works on the costume crew of ""High School Musical,"" pulling together runway-ready fashion on a high school budget.

Julia Lester (Ashlyn) – Los Angeles native Julia Lester has been working professionally since the age of five. Some of her television credits include recurring roles on the comedy ""Mom,"" ""Prince of Peoria"" and ""Mr. Student Body President."" She has performed in dozens of local and regional musical productions including ""Carrie: The Musical"" and ""Next to Normal."" Lester plays E.J.'s cousin, Ashlyn, an ""old soul"" who worships Sara Bareilles and is an aspiring songwriter on the sly.

See Also Are These TV Parodies of High School Musical Better Than the Real Thing? To celebrate 10 years of the Disney phenomenon, we rounded up some of our favorite HSM references that captured the musical's spirit (and cultural impact).

Frankie A. Rodriguez (Carlos) – Rodriguez has worked in television and film for the last four years and can be seen in the guest-starring role of Eduardo on ABC's ""Modern Family."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" Rodriguez plays Carlos — captain of the color guard and the student choreographer for the show. Carlos thinks of Miss Jenn as a peer. He eats lunch in her office, has been drinking espresso since the 3rd grade and already has his Tony Awards speech memorized.

Larry Saperstein (Big Red) – Born and raised in Long Island, New York, Saperstein acted opposite Kiernan Shipka in the film ""Fan Girl"" and will guest star in an upcoming episode of BET's ""The First Wives Club."" A skater boy through and through, Big Red is the spiritual cousin of both Bill and Ted: always fuzzy and he's been sleep-deprived since preschool. Big Red is weirdly devastated by Ricky and Nini's breakup — his surest role is as their wisecracking third wheel.

Mark St. Cyr (Mr. Mazzara) – A Louisiana native and an alumna of the ABC Diversity Showcase, St. Cyr's credits include the film ""Marshall"" opposite Chadwick Boseman and Jussie Smollett, and the critically acclaimed ""Doomsday."" He also guest starred on ""Chicago P.D."" and ""After After Party."" In ""High School Musical: The Musical,"" St. Cyr plays Mr. Mazzara, East High's somewhat robotic S.T.E.M. teacher. His belief in preparing students for the future often leads him to butt heads with Miss Jenn, who would rather sing about life than live in the real world.

The series was developed and executive produced by Tim Federle alongside showrunner and executive producer Oliver Goldstick.

This latest development arrives more than two weeks after the assault and one day after Smollett’s emotional GMA interview, in which he declared being “pissed off” at those who doubt his account of events. The arrests were first reported by CBS Chicago and confirmed by CNN, which received word from Chicago PD Communications Deputy Director Tom Ahern.

The two suspects are the same Nigerian brothers who were previously described as “potential suspects” on Thursday by Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. No charges have been filed yet, nor have police elaborated upon what crimes the men have been accused of. Guglielmi further sought to dampen “hoax” rumors that surfaced on Thursday in a statement via CNN:

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” Guglielmi said in Friday’s statement. “While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.” “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added.

In addition, FOX has denied reports (that fueled the hoax rumors) that Smollett was about to be written off Empire prior to the attack. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” 20th Century Fox TV relayed to E! Online. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago PD also previously stated that they had “no reason to doubt” any statements about the attack made by Smollett and his manager. The actor and singer also explained on GMA why he declined to turn over his phone (privacy reasons) for “three or four hours” to a police tech. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my cast mate’s number, my friends’ numbers,” he explained. “My private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Smollett has accused two ski mask-wearing assailants of hitting him over the head while yelling homophobic and racial slurs, along with placing a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him. He insists that he’s remained “100% factual and consistent” in his statements to law enforcement.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that the men were taken into custody as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett's story was subject to intense scrutiny as widespread reports suggested he had misled police, though officials denied any wrongdoing by the actor.

Two men were arrested in connection to a reported hate attack on ""Empire"" Jussie Smollett that occurred last month in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that two brothers of Nigerian descent were taken into custody at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men. No charges have been brought against the suspects at this time.

Chicago Police said in a statement January 30 that it was investigating a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" involving an ""Empire"" cast member, but didn't name Smollett at that time.

According to TMZ, Smollett arrived in Chicago late Monday and went to a Subway for something to eat early on Tuesday morning. As he was leaving the restaurant, two men approached him and one yelled, ""Aren't you that f----- Empire n-----?,"" sources connected to Smollett told TMZ.

The source also reportedly told TMZ that the two men were white and wearing ski masks, and after pouring bleach on Smollett, one of them yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck, according to police.

The two suspects mark a significant development in the case.

Confusion surrounding the case

Since the reported attack, multiple outlets reported that police were considering charging Smollett with making a false report if the case proves to be a hoax.

However, officer Carroll Michael denied that the police department is treating Smollett as anything but a victim, and said reports to the contrary were false.

""False report charges, huh?"" Michael told INSIDER. ""We said multiple times, he is still considered a victim.""

The case grew more confusing when a report by WLS-TV claimed that police were investigating whether or not Smollett, an openly gay actor and musician, who plays Jamal Joseph Lyon on the hit television show, staged the attack because he was being written off the television show.

In a statement sent to INSIDER, Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied the report, calling it ""patently ridiculous.""

Two men characterized by police as ""persons of interest"" in the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett are now considered suspects and have been arrested on ""probable cause that they may have committed a crime,"" a Chicago police spokesman said Friday. Associated Press/May 20, 2016

Chicago police said Friday that they had arrested two ""potential suspects"" in the alleged assault against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

In a statement, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that ""detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

""We are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Guglielmi added.

Police have not identified the two men, who have not been charged.

Amid recent news reports that Smollett had staged his own attack in the city last month, Guglielmi reiterated in the statement that the actor ""is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

Chicago police have said they're investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. Smollett told police he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance, which he believes to be bleach, on him. According to Smollett, at least one assailant told him ""this is MAGA country"" during the attack.

The Associated Press reported that the two men, previously seen in a surveillance image released last month, were identified by police as Nigerian brothers who were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday. According to the AP, the police learned that at least one of the men worked on ""Empire.""

The police have not confirmed to The Washington Post whether the men have a direct connection with Smollett.

Two reports published Thursday evening questioned the veracity of Smollett's allegations. CBS Chicago -- citing an unnamed ""source with intimate knowledge of the investigation"" -- reported that investigators believe Smollett and two ""non-cooperating witnesses"" had staged the attack. ABC 7, meanwhile, published a report citing ""multiple sources"" who told the ABC affiliate that police were investigating whether the actor and the ""two persons of interest"" had ""staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off 'Empire.' ""

But in a tweet Thursday night, Guglielmi said the hoax reports were ""unconfirmed by case detectives."" He noted that police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who told ABC 7 earlier this month that Smollett ""had been cooperative"" in the investigation, had followed up with them ""to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment also responded to the reports in a strongly worded statement: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Several of Smollett's ""Empire"" colleagues, including co-creator Danny Strong, also denied the show had considered writing off the actor's character, Jamal Lyon, an openly gay R&B artist.

The hoax reports surfaced on the same day ""Good Morning America"" aired an interview with Smollett, who talked in detail for the first time about the alleged attack. Smollett appeared emotional as he spoke to ABC's Robin Roberts. He said he was angry about the attack and critics doubting his account.

""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

The actor said he believed some doubted his story because his attackers referenced President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett also said some media reports about his alleged assault were inaccurate. He said, for example, he never told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats. ""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

He explained some of the more scrutinized details of the case, including why he didn't change his clothes or remove the rope from his neck after the attack (""I wanted [the police] to see what this was,"" he told Roberts.) Smollett also explained his initial hesitation, referenced in the police report, to go to police.

""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,"" he said. ""And I'm not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.""

Smollett has established himself as an activist, working alongside organizations dedicated to HIV/AIDS awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy -- a background he referenced while addressing the skepticism surrounding his claims.

""I'm an advocate. I respect too much the people -- who I am now one of those people -- who have been attacked in any way,"" he told Roberts. ""You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.""

According to the Associated Press, Chicago P.D. spokesman Anthony Guglielmi revealed exclusively to the news outlet that authorities had taken two Nigerian brothers into custody for questioning related to suspicions they may have been connected to the assault.

The outlet also went on to note that police were informed that one of the brothers worked on Empire. Police obtained a search warrant for the men's apartment, but have not divulged what they discovered.

Additionally, Guglielmi also recently spoke out about claims that Smollett's attack never actually happened, stating that detectives have not determined that to be accurate.

Smollet provided a statement to Essence and addressed the attack, as well as his state of mind and physical health after the fact.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” the actor said. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" Smollett added.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he also said. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett concluded his statement, ""With Love, respect & honor... Jussie."""

Meanwhile, a lawyer for two Nigerian brothers who were questioned in the case (and who police believed may have been seen in surveillance video on the night of the alleged attack) said Thursday that her clients had been extras on Empire and had been on ""cordial"" terms with Smollett.

And that update is this:

Two men have been arrested in conjunction with Empire actor Jussie Smollett getting savagely beaten in Chicago last month.

According to TMZ, a pair of brothers from Nigeria named Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo have been taken into custody by the Chicago police department.

(UPDATE: ""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Friday evening.)

They have been labeled ""potential suspects"" in this beating, as opposed to mere ""persons of interests,"" which is a key distinction.

As previously reported on The Hollywood Gossip and via other outlets, the siblings were picked up at O'Hare Airport on Wednesday night and subsequent had their home raided.

Police reportedly found shoes, a laptop and other possible pieces of evidence there that may link them to the Smollett investigation.

But here's where it gets interesting and sort of troubling...

Smollett had previously told the cops that his attackers were white.

He claimed they screamed that he was in ""MAGA Country"" at the time of the incident, while also screaming racial and anti-gay epithets in his direction.

Now... is it possible that two African-Americans could have uttered these words? Sure. Anything is possible.

But the brothers had also previously worked as extras on Empire. Their attorney has confirmed to a CBS affiliate in Chicago that they knew Smollett pretty well.

Now... is it possible they therefore knew where he lived and knew his whereabouts on the night of the alleged attack? Sure.

However, there's been rather serious talk that Smollett actually staged this assault and both the skin color of these suspects - and their connection to the actor definitely gives us reason to consider this theory.

Why would Smollett do such a thing?

We really don't wish to speculate too much on such a sensitive and seemingly wild/horrible possibility, but the ABC affiliate in Chicago alleges that he was about to be written off Empire.

Presumably, turning himself into a victim of a hate crime that received national attention would have made Smollett into far too much of a sympathetic figure for producers to follow through with this plan.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, however, released a statement in response to the rumor that Smollett was being fired, dismissing the rumor out of hand:

The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous.

He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand by him.

To review, Smollett has claimed two men verbally berated him with racist and homophobic slurs early in the morning of January 29.

He says they poured a substance, believed to be bleach all over him; and tied a rope around his neck.

Speaking to Good Morning America on Thursday after the beating, Smollett challenged his critics and insisted he's telling the truth.

""I'm pissed off,"" he told Robin Roberts early in their chat, citing the criticism he's received from doubters of the attack.

“They called me a f—-t, they called me a n–ga. There’s no which way you cut it,” Smollett said, adding:

""I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative. I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.""

As for why he waited a short while before calling the police to report what happened?

He cited the idea of ""pride"" and explained:

""We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow, to be weak, and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as a people, are not weak.""

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that the men were taken into custody as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett’s story was subject to intense scrutiny as widespread reports suggested he had misled police, though officials denied any wrongdoing by the actor.

Two men were arrested in connection to a reported hate attack on “Empire” Jussie Smollett that occurred last month in Chicago.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to INSIDER that two brothers of Nigerian descent were taken into custody at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as suspects in connection to the attack, in which Smollett told police he was beaten by two men. No charges have been brought against the suspects at this time.

Chicago Police said in a statement January 30 that it was investigating a “possible racially charged assault and battery” involving an “Empire” cast member, but didn’t name Smollett at that time.

According to TMZ, Smollett arrived in Chicago late Monday and went to a Subway for something to eat early on Tuesday morning. As he was leaving the restaurant, two men approached him and one yelled, “Aren’t you that f—– Empire n—–?,” sources connected to Smollett told TMZ.

The source also reportedly told TMZ that the two men were white and wearing ski masks, and after pouring bleach on Smollett, one of them yelled, “This is MAGA country,” before the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck, according to police.

The two suspects mark a significant development in the case.

Confusion surrounding the case

Since the reported attack, multipleoutlets reported that police were considering charging Smollett with making a false report if the case proves to be a hoax.

However, officer Carroll Michael denied that the police department is treating Smollett as anything but a victim, and said reports to the contrary were false.

“False report charges, huh?” Michael told INSIDER. “We said multiple times, he is still considered a victim.”

The case grew more confusing when a report by WLS-TV claimed that police were investigating whether or not Smollett, an openly gay actor and musician, who plays Jamal Joseph Lyon on the hit television show, staged the attack because he was being written off the television show.

In a statement sent to INSIDER, Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied the report, calling it “patently ridiculous.”

Two Potential Suspects Arrested in Jussie Smollett Attack Case: Reports

Two men have been arrested as “potential suspects” in connection with the Jussie Smollett case, CNN reported.

The men, identified as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were taken in for questioning, but now Chicago police officials are calling them “potential suspects” in the attack, TMZ reported on Feb. 15.

Their home was raided by police on Feb. 13, and they seized evidence, including bottles of bleach that were allegedly used in the assault against Smollett, who appeared on the show “Empire,” according to the report.

ARRESTS made in Jussie Smollett attack. Gepostet von TMZ am Freitag, 15. Februar 2019

A law enforcement official said that they will be placed in a lineup in which Smollett will be asked to identify suspects in the attack.

Smollett said that his attackers were white and yelled “this is MAGA country” in a late-night incident, apparently in reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Smollett also alleged his two attackers shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him last month before wrapping a rope around his neck, according to previous reports.

But the Osundairo brothers, who are originally from Nigeria, don’t fit the description the actor had gave to police.

One of the brothers told TMZ that he worked on “Empire.” Smollett played a prison inmate on season two of the show.

Police sources have told a number of news outlets, including the Chicago Tribune, that they are investigating the possibility that the attack was staged with the help of the two brothers.

Their attorney also told the Tribune that they knew the actor and spent time with him at the gym.

Reports said they were arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, but details were scant.

Smollett released a statement Feb. 14, which said, “Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” ABC7 reported.

There was speculation that Smollett’s character was being booted from “Empire,” which prompted his representatives to issue a statement on the matter.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment also attempted to clarify the rumor. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” it said, the ABC affiliate reported.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that detectives “haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack,” but he said there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” the Tribune report said.

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he said.

Chicago police investigators are “working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” the spokesman said.

In an interview with ABC News, Smollett also said that “I respect too much the people who—I am now one of those people—who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”"

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

The brothers from Nigeria, Olabinjo “Ola” and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo were picked up at O’Hare International Airport, as they were returning from a trip to Nigeria.

Olabinjo has appeared on “Empire” and Abimbola said he’s worked on the show before.

CBS Chicago reports that the two men have now been arrested and TMZ says they were booked for battery.

This development is amidst reports that Jussie allegedly orchestrated the attack so he wouldn’t be written off the show.

Fox had stated that he wasn’t being written off the show and police has said there’s “no evidence” the actor staged the attack.

Jussie described his attackers as white but the Osundairo brothers are black.

Jussie has also been discovered to be following Abel on Instagram.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” Gloria Schmidt, their attorney told CBS Chicago.

A Chicago law enforcement source told TMZ that the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two were arrested for “probable cause” of committing assault and battery on the “‘Empire’ cast member” but had not been charged as of Friday afternoon. Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

The two suspects — whom police previously had identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation ."

The men arrested have been identified as 25-year-old Abel Osundairo and brother Ola Osundairo, 27, who hail from Nigeria.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said in a statement Friday.

Police say the two brothers are the shadowy figures caught on surveillance cameras shortly before the alleged attack. They have denied any wrongdoing.

Smollett says he's certain the two men in the photograph are the men who attacked him.

“I don't have any doubt in my mind that's them. Never did,” he told ABC News.

Both men have links the 36-year-old actor and have appeared as extras on “Empire.” Ola appeared in a scene with Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard.

The brothers flew to Nigeria hours after the alleged attack. Video on social media shows one of them giving money to an injured teenager there.

They returned to Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday at 5:45 pm, where detectives were waiting for them.

Police searched their apartment in Chicago hours later. A handwritten inventory shows they took away bleach, black face mask, a red hat, an “Empire” script, a laptop and receipts.

Questions have been raised about whether the reported attack actually happened.

Thursday morning Smollett talked about the attack on “Good Morning America” with Robin Roberts. At 7:42 a.m., while the show was still on the air, police revealed they were questioning two ""persons of interest.""

A blizzard of apparently conflicting information followed.

At 7 p.m., police said they were ""investigating ... whether an attack happened at all.""

On Friday at 8 a.m., police said, ""There is no evidence to say this is a hoax.""

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi told the Los Angeles Times in a statement. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox slammed media reports that Smollett was being written out of the hit show.

“The idea is patently ridiculous he remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand by him,” they said in a statement.

Two people have been arrested in connection with the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, Chicago police confirmed Friday.

The men, who police have identified as Nigerian brothers, were in custody after being picked up at O’Hare Airport on Wednesday.

Their names have not been released, as the men have not yet been charged.

Police confirmed earlier Friday that the two people being questioned in the investigation were being classified as potential suspects.

They were initially described as persons of interest when police announced they were talking to them on Thursday.

“For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classfied (sic) as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” reads the statement put out Friday by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

He also said the “interrogations” with the two people and their attorney will resume Friday.

Police said last month that Smollett — an actor on the Fox series “Empire” — was allegedly attacked in Chicago by two people who put a rope around his neck, poured an unidentified substance on him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Officials said they were investigating the case as a possible hate crime.

The new developments comes a day after a media report sparked speculation that Smollett was potentially involved in staging the attack because his character on “Empire” was being written off.

Authorities refuted that report and said they have no reason to believe Smollett’s story is a hoax.

Police have not seen footage of the confrontation itself but have obtained security video showing Smollett with a rope draped around his neck.

A rep for 20th Century Fox, the studio behind “Empire,” denied that Smollett might be written off the show, calling him a “core player on this very successful series.”

Smollett said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that one of the attackers told him it was “MAGA country” before punching him in the face. (“MAGA” refers to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make American Great Again.”)

“So I punched his ass back,” Smollett told Robin Roberts in the interview. “And then we started tussling. It was very icy, and we ended up tussling by the stairs, fighting, fighting, fighting. There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back, and then it just stopped and they ran off.”"

The two men are brothers—Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo—and are in police custody following their questioning Thursday.

“We can confirm that they have been arrested, but they have not been charged,” Chicago P.D. P.I.O. news-affairs official Sally Born told Deadline, which reports that at least one of the men once appeared on Empire as an extra. A statement from Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, given to V.F., read: “Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Discussion surrounding the Smollett case has grown increasingly messy since the incident first occurred in late January. Skeptics have emerged, questioning Smollett’s account of events, with some going as far as to suggest the entire thing was a hoax aimed at saving Smollett from being written off the Fox drama on which he stars. Later on Thursday, Chicago police said there is “no evidence” to suggest that was the case. Fox, meanwhile, issued a statement of its own: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett has said he initially did not want to report his attack to police. As the actor told Robin Roberts on Good Morning America Thursday, “There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.” Almost immediately after news of his attack broke, there was an outpouring of support for Smollett, from celebrities across entertainment and politics. In his first statement following the attack, Smollett wrote, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words . . . during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”"

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him."

After that incident, Smollett refused extra security.

The veracity of the story has been in question as more details have emerged, however. In spite of the fact that the alleged attack occurred in one of the most heavily surveilled areas of Chicago, no video exists of the attack.

Smollett claims that he was on the phone with his manager when the attack occurred, but neither he nor his manager were willing to turn over their phone or records of their calls. When the actor turned over records two weeks after the attack, they were heavily redacted and in a document format that could be easily manipulated.

The “Empire” star didn’t call police from the scene and asked them to turn off their body cameras when they arrived. Also, the Subway sandwich he was getting at the time of the alleged assault remained perfectly intact.

Now comes news that Chicago Police have carried out a raid and arrested two “persons of interest” and potential suspects in the alleged attack — and the reason why they happen to be of interest isn’t good for Smollett’s case.

According to WBBM-TV, the Wednesday raid was aimed at two brothers of Nigerian descent who know Smollett and at least one of them appeared on “Empire” as an extra.

“They do know Jussie,” their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said. “They have worked with him on ‘Empire.’ My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

WBBM’s Charlie Del Mar reported that the mens’ family says the two left for Nigeria the day of the attack. Perhaps most importantly, electronics and bleach — the chemical that was thrown on Smollett by the alleged attackers — were seized by police.

The two men were picked up by police Wednesday at O’Hare Airport upon their return.

We’ve seen plenty of high-profile fake hate-crime stories that have allegedly had something to do with Trump from the moment he was elected to now. Even when we’re not dealing specifically with the arena of hate crimes, we have stuff like the Covington Catholic incident where Nathan Phillips claims that he heard the students chanting “build the wall,” even as reams of video seem to disprove this.

Of course, we simply don’t know whether or not we’re dealing with a fake hate crime here, but some of pieces haven’t added up for quite some time. Smollett isn’t helping matters, saying he’s “pissed” at anyone who doesn’t believe his story.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told ABC News. “A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

This evidence is significant because Smollett reported that his attackers put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him during the incident. However, in his account, the 36-year old actor and singer said that the two masked men were white and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him as they repeatedly punched him.

As this situation continues to get more confusing, Smollett will now be forced to identify the men in an official police lineup. Earlier this week, he appeared on Good Morning America for his first sit down interview where he told Robin Roberts that part of what’s been so painful is dealing with the critics who don’t want to believe the details of his assault.

TMZ first broke the news that the popular actor and singer was hospitalized after being attacked. According to Variety, the officers were informed that the actor “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

Smollett also said he believes that the men featured in the surveillance tape released after the attack are indeed the individuals the police are looking for, however, the police have yet to confirm that the Osundairo brothers are the men in that photo.

Both brothers are active on social media and describe themselves as actors and models.

The men were identified as two Nigerian brothers, according to The Associated Press.

CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said both were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery, but not charged, for possibly being involved in the alleged attack. One of the men worked on “Empire,” but it is not clear how much this person was involved, The AP reported.

The arrest comes after multiple media outlets and journalists reported on various allegations surrounding the incident.

Sources claimed the attack was allegedly planned by Smollett and the “persons of interest” could have been co-conspirators after learning that Smollett’s character was allegedly “being written out of the show ‘Empire.'”

“TOP SOURCE: ‘…indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event….'” CBS Chicago’s Brad Edwards tweeted.

“Empire” writers countered the allegation about writing off Smollett’s character, however.

“The writers of Empire have never planned or even discussed writing @JussieSmollett off of the show,” the Empire Writers tweeted Thursday.

Guglielmi also said that media reports about whether the attack was a hoax were not confirmed.

“Media reports about [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Smollett claimed two men beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs and threw an unidentified chemical substance on him on Jan. 29, according to The AP. He reported that the attackers said “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country,” in a follow-up interview with CPD.

The “Empire” star disputed that he ever said the attackers wore MAGA hats in a Good Morning America interview Thursday.

CPD did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

“Police can detain the potential suspects for an additional 24 hours past the 48 hour holding period under special circumstances, but it must go through the prosecutors office and has to be clear process,” police told ABC News.

Rumors have swirled that Smollett might have faked the attack that drew national attention. He strongly disputed those claims in an interview with ABC News that aired Thursday morning.

Police Friday “shut down any reports that there was evidence to classify the alleged attack as a hoax.”

Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

EARLIER: More than two weeks after an apparent racial and homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, two men have been arrested, the Chicago PD confirmed to EW, adding that no charges have yet been filed.

While police tell EW they can’t confirm the identities of the men until charges are approved, TMZ reports they are Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, whose house was raided by Chicago PD on Wednesday.

The arrest of the men comes the day after two Chicago media outlets reported that police believed Smollett wasn’t the victim of a recent attack, but that he and his two supposed attackers staged the incident because the actor was being written off of Empire. The Chicago PD quickly struck those reports down as “uninformed and inaccurate,” while Fox and the Empire team strongly denied any possibility that Smollett, who has starred as Jamal Lyon for all five seasons, would be killed off the show.

On Jan. 29, Smollett, who is gay and plays a gay character on Empire, was walking to get food in Chicago, where the series films, when he says two unknown offenders approached him, yelling racial and homophobic slurs. They then attacked him, he claims, pouring an unknown chemical substance on him and even wrapping a rope around his neck. The offenders fled the scene, while Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital.

“I went to the Subway, got my order,” Smollett said on Thursday’s Good Morning America, his first interview since the attack. “During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia…I said, ‘Call me when you can.’ He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, ‘Empire!’ And I don’t answer to Empire, my name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ”f— Empire n—.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘What the f– did you just say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n–,’ and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his a— back and then we started tussling.” He added: “There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.”"

The men arrested, who had previously been called persons of interest in the case, are a pair of brothers from Nigeria. These men have been neither identified nor charged, according to the report.

Meanwhile, according to ABC News, police have said both that the two suspects know Smollett, and issued a statement indicating that Smollett was, in fact, attacked.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” police said in a statement Friday. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

The news of the arrest follows a whirlwind of news in the case in recent days. On Thursday, Smollett appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America to deny accusations that he had staged the attack.

That night, per the Inquisitr, a local TV station in Chicago cited police sources — alleging that police believed that Smollett had faked the attack, with the assistance of the two men who were considered persons of interest. The accusation was that Smollett had staged the attack with the help of the two men in order to gain sympathy because he had learned that he was being written off of the TV show.

However, within 30 minutes of the report from ABC 7 Chicago, a spokesman from the Chicago Police Department issued a statement that the report about the incident being a hoax was “unconfirmed by case detectives.” Meanwhile, both the Fox Network and a Twitter account for the Empire writers’ room strongly denied the charge that Smollett was ever going to be dropped from the show.

The two men arrested had seen their residence searched by police earlier this week, and they had been referred to earlier as “potential suspects.”

Smollett, who is also a singer, said he was attacked on January 29 — a cold night in Chicago — as he was leaving a Subway sandwhich location. He said at the time that the attackers made racial and homophobic slurs, and had even shouted MAGA slogans. He also claimed they had thrown an unknown liquid on him, and had even placed a rope around his neck.

As some quarters have raised doubts about whether the attack happened the way Smollett said it did, the actor has continued to maintain that he has told the truth throughout."

The investigation into black actor Jussie Smollett's account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took a sharp turn Friday when police announced the arrest of two black men they believe assaulted the ""Empire"" cast member.

At least one of the men worked on the TV show, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said authorities had probable cause to believe the suspects committed assault and battery against Smollett. But they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Guglielmi would not comment on a possible motive.

Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

The police spokesman said that there is ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

The two suspects, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi said police also searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

The police spokesman's comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax.

Police said those reports were unconfirmed. And the producers of ""Empire"" disputed as ""patently ridiculous"" news reports that Smollett's character was being written out of the show before the attack.

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

Exact charges are pending, but TMZ has identified the individuals as Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, two brothers who were first detained by police on Wednesday after authorities raided their home and recovered items that included a black face mask, an Empire script, and bleach.

The arrests follow multiple anonymously sourced reports from last night that police are investigating whether the apparent hate crime—during which Smollett said his assailants placed a noose around his neck, poured a chemical that appeared to be bleach over his head, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs—was potentially staged. In response to these reports, a CPD spokesperson denied that Smollett is considered a suspect rather than a victim and said there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

Both Osundario brothers are actors and TMZ has reported Olabinjo appeared as an extra in Empire’s second season. Their attorney Gloria Schmidt has said they knew Smollett and were horrified to learn he was attacked. “When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know,” Schmidt told CBS Chicago. “This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Police did not identify the two men because they had not been charged as of Friday afternoon.

Chicago police said Thursday that they had identified two ""persons of interest"" who were in the area where Smollett said he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. Smollett, who is openly gay, told police two men yelled racist and anti-gay slurs, hit him in the face, poured a bleachlike chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Police questioned both men and on Friday morning classified them as ""potential suspects."" They were arrested a few hours later and continue to be questioned by police.

The case took a new turn Thursday night after two local Chicago news stations reported that Smollett, along with the two men, may have staged the attack out of fear that he was being written off of Empire.

But Chicago police pushed back on the reports, saying that while they had not been able to find any video documenting the alleged attack, there was no evidence to indicate it was a hoax, and that Smollett was still being treated as the ""alleged victim.""

Fox and 20th Century Fox also refuted the local reports.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the studios said in a statement.

The two men in custody are brothers who worked as extras on Empire and occasionally went to the gym with Smollett, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago on Thursday.

Schmidt, who could not immediately be reached on Friday, said the brothers were returning from a trip to Nigeria when police detained them at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday.

Authorities also raided the brothers' home and found ""a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, a red hat, and bleach,"" CBS Chicago reported."

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him."

Two Nigerian brothers have been arrested in connection to the attack on Jussie Smollett, Chicago police confirmed Friday.

In an earlier statement, police said they had “probable cause” that the two men may have been involved.

On January 29, the “Empire” star says he was attacked by men who hurled racist and antigay slurs at him, shouted, “This is MAGA country!”, poured an unknown substance, possibly bleach, on him, and put a noose around his neck.

The two men are being represented by attorney Gloria Schmidt, who told CBS News:

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest. It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She said that the men, who have not yet been publicly identified, worked on the set of Smollett’s Fox TV show “Empire” and even worked out with him at the gym.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she added. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

The news comes after two Chicago news affiliates for ABC and CBS reported Thursday that police were investigating whether the men helped Smollett fake the attack, citing as a motive that he was being written off the hit show.

Those reports were quickly shot down by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

For what it’s worth (and it’s worth quite a lot in our view), 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment strongly denied there were plans to write off Smollett’s character, the out musician “Jamal Lyon,” drawing into further question the legitimacy of the two news reports.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” the network’s statement said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

According to CBS News, the brothers left for Nigeria the same day as the attack and were detained upon their return by police at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago Wednesday.

A police raid at the brothers’ Chicago home uncovered bleach, a “black facemask hat,” a red hat, an “Empire” script, and other items.

In his first interview since the attack, the 36-year-old actor told ABC’s Robin Roberts:

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

BYU ushered in Black History Month with an Instagram story series calling for change in daily campus exchanges. The stories were posted Jan. 29 and are now featured as a highlight titled “Respect” on the university’s official page.

Since then, the posts have sparked discussions on campus and in the comments online, with many praising the openness of the story’s conversation. BYU’s Instagram initiative offered a platform to African-American students who feel the university’s discussion on diversity has a long way to go.

BYU sociology professor Jacob Rugh praised the initiative as a necessary step in the right direction and a perfect segue into Black History Month’s purpose of promoting cultural acceptance.

“I thought it exceeded expectations,” Rugh said. “There’s a line in (the Instagram story) that talks about respect. Respect isn’t just about not offending — it’s also being proactive about how we honor others.”

Kira Nielsen, a public relations major and representative of the Black Student Union at BYU, insisted the end of the Civil Rights movement does not equate the end of white supremacy, nor does it mean its relevance does not reach the banks of the Great Salt Lake.

“Just because Martin Luther King gave a speech and Rosa sat on a bus doesn’t mean it’s over and everything is solved,” Nielsen said.

Nielsen lamented that even in 2019, racist symbols continue to permeate the community. Yet differing opinions suggest the connotation of many of these symbols is rarely clear cut.

According to the Daily Herald, the Confederate flag made an appearance at the Harvest Days Parade in Midvale in August, sparking outrage from some and support from others. The dispute led Midvale Councilman Dustin Gettel to question whether the flag has any place in the public sphere.

BYU student Virginia Jones is from Memphis, Tennessee. She said her ancestors fought in the Civil War to defend their homes and that she is proud to be from a place “where people will go to war to protect their way of life.”

That, she said, is why she owns a Confederate flag.

“I don’t necessarily think it’s good or bad,” Jones said. “I think the flag itself represents an organization that no longer exists.”

In her own experience with racial insensitivity, Nielsen said that despite the original intention of the Confederate symbol, its association with 150 years worth of terrorism inevitably taints it.

“When I see someone with the Confederate flag, I feel terrified,” Nielsen said. “I immediately think of all of our people who were lynched and murdered and killed and enslaved. It is not right to use it as a pride symbol.”

Alexandria Gamble owns a Confederate flag as a memento of her Latter-day Saint mission in Tennessee. She said it signifies to her, as it does to many southerners, one’s pride in heritage and home.

In the debate about the flag’s place in American society, if any, Gamble proposed the flag may be historically revered while modestly displayed. She says that while the back of a truck may not be appropriate, the flag belongs in a museum or cultural center.

“Although it represents a somewhat un-American thing like secession,” Gamble said, “it’s a historical piece. There’s too much trying to erase the past. If we (remove it), we won’t learn from it.”

Nielsen said the consistent presence of Confederate flags in hate crimes condemns their place in public, even if other owners’ intentions innocently seek to honor their heritage.

After the Charlottesville attacks in 2017, Confederate flag sales quadrupled in Civil War memorabilia stores in Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia, with one Georgia store owner claiming to still sell as many as 15,000 flags a year, according to Reuters.

A report from the Anti-Defamation League signifies that hate crimes on racial basis have gone up 18 percent in 2017. Nielsen credited the rise to Trump’s inauguration. She further said the consistent presence of “Make America Great Again” hats from Trump’s campaign mark them as another symbol of racism.

African American actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by two unidentified men on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago, according to reports from CBS News. Smollett reported they held nooses in their hands and shouted racial slurs as they beat him and poured acid on his body. Smollett reported hearing them shout the words “MAGA country” until eventually, they ran away. His claim is under investigation.

According to a Wall Street Journal Article, Chicago police are now preparing to take the case to a grand jury with evidence that Smollett’s attack claim was actually a false report.

BYU sociology major and Black Student Union member Andra Johnson claimed when he sees a group of white people wearing MAGA hats, it is enough to make him feel unsafe and go out of his way to avoid them.

Nielsen echoed these sentiments when she said that even for people who feel the hat is an article of political support, its presence in prejudice crimes marks it as a blatant symbol of hate.

“You have to be aware of the symbol it has become,” Nielsen said. “If communities of supremacists who are emboldened by racism are wearing those hats, then they’re going to start being connected by wearing that symbol — just like the KKK.”

BYU student Chase Fowers grew up in the heart of the South in Augusta, Georgia. Majoring in political science, Fowers said a distinction needs to be made between extremism and freedom of speech. Just as Fowers said the Confederate flag should be left to individual discretion, he said that protecting the MAGA hat takes a stand for protecting all individuals’ freedom to express themselves.

“Personally I would take off my hat if it caused another person to experience fear,” Fowers said. “Ultimately, I think it’s an issue with freedom of speech. We can’t be selective — even if it’s offensive.”

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in Utah, a state of over three million registered residents, African Americans constitute just 1.4 percent of the population. Students like Kira Nielsen and Andra Johnson said they have felt singled out, stared at and discriminated against, even if most offenders have had innocent if ignorant, intentions.

Growing up as a black member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Johnson described having to confront racist symbols at scouting activities. Perhaps unknowingly placing Johnson in an uncomfortable situation, a few of the boys would tie nooses when they practiced knots.

“Being one of the only black people in the Church, it always made me feel weird,” Johnson said. “Their ancestors might have used that same knot to hang my ancestors from a tree. I don’t see any uses nowadays for that kind of knot.”

Johnson reminisced that when it came time to go to college, he expected BYU to be a good Church school where everyone was kind and generally like-minded.

“I thought it would be heaven,” he said. “Then I got here, and I’m like, ‘Did you just call me cursed?'”

Sitting in one of his first religion classes talking about priesthood privileges, Johnson said he was shocked to hear his peers so bluntly talk about the “Curse of Cain.” Despite repeated discouragement from Church leaders, the “Curse of Cain” is a theory suggesting that African Americans were forbidden the priesthood until 1979 because of their ancestry. As Cain was given a mark to signify his banishment from God’s favor, some members suggest this mark manifests itself in one’s blackness.



Johnson said one of the worst weeks to be black at BYU is homecoming week. When older generations return to their alma mater, Johnson said he and his friends often receive unwarranted comments in public.

“This last homecoming, an old guy came up to me and my friend and said, ‘Hey there, darkies. I served my mission in Africa, and I just love you darkies,'” Johnson said. “I didn’t know how to respond to him.”

Another time, an elderly man and his wife went out of their way to approach Johnson and eight of his black friends while they were eating lunch to say, “A lot has changed since I’ve been here.”

“We didn’t know how to take that,” Johnson said. “How do you take that?”

For Nielsen, racism at BYU “manifests itself in the various micro-aggressions that occur daily” — in the little moments of “the looks and the faces, the open mouths and the gaping” whenever she and her friends meet as a group.

Just recently, Nielsen said she was standing by the BYU Store with four other black girls. As they stood there, a group of white women passing by stopped in their tracks and stared with their mouths open. They whispered to each other before they walked away, all in front of Nielsen and her companions.

“You would think we were robbing a bank,” Nielsen said, adding that people even hide their kids when they walk by. “It constantly happens.”

Johnson and Nielsen urged BYU students to recognize their part in breaking down racial barriers, even if they feel they have no personal experience with racism. One of the most validating experiences, they said, was when President Kevin Worthen and his wife attended a meeting with the Black Student Union this year.

Rugh praised President Worthen’s presence in the Instagram initiative, which they said demonstrated his desire to welcome greater diversity at the university. Rugh said he felt it was an example for all students that a white man, as president of the university, endorsed everything that was said. He insists this is just the kind of support the black community needs.

“We need allies,” Nielsen said. “We need allies who’ve never really experienced what we have, but can say, ‘I’m listening, I validate your experience and I want to help.'”

*The Jussie Smollett situation took another turn today when Chicago police confirmed they are talking to two persons of interest in connection with the alleged attack on the “Empire” actor.

Here’s the interesting part. Multiple sources say police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.”

Yes, you read that right. It sounds crazy, but that’s what police are saying.

ABC7 in Chicago says Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday, but police confirm that they are continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing.

Meanwhile, Smollett released a statement Thursday evening, saying:

“Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate.”

And as far as Smollett being written off of “Empire,” the actor’s rep denied the report.

Even Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement saying the actor wasn’t being written off.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Here’s more via ABC7:

A source briefed on the Smollett investigation confirmed to ABC News that Chicago police are questioning the two persons of interest — one of whom has appeared on “Empire.”

The law enforcement official also told ABC News that the homes of the persons of interest were raided Wednesday night. Police removed shoes, electronic devices and other items they believe could help them determine if the two people played any role in the assault.

Chicago police said they “cannot confirm any of those reports.” No charges have been filed.

Earlier, police said the two persons of interest are not suspects and have not been charged. Investigators are only talking with them at this time. The two were picked up Wednesday night at O’Hare International Airport, police said.

Smollett said he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 in the 300-block of East North Water Street in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. He told police two masked men shouted homophobic slurs at him, attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured a liquid on him that smelled like bleach.

Smollett, 36, is black and openly gay."

UPDATE: Nigerian brothers released. Get full story here.

*Earlier we said it could happen. Now, it’s has happened. In the Jussie Smollet investigation, police have now arrested those 2 men who are brothers with ties to “Empire.” Specifically, they were booked for battery.

The two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are from Nigeria and Chicago cops are now calling them “potential suspects” … as opposed to persons of interest. As was reported earlier, their home was raided on Thursday and police seized a long list of potential evidence … including several bottles of bleach (see the video above).

A Chicago law enforcement source tells TMZ that the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits.

Earlier, we reported …

*There’s movement in the Jussie Smollett alleged hate crime story. Two brothers from Nigeria, identified earlier as “persons of interest,” could face charges in the case, according to their attorney.

On the other hand, it’s not clear what the men could be charged with, their legal rep, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News. By the way, Chicago police have until 5:45pm today to charge them, otherwise they will have to be freed from custody.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt said. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She said the men, identified by CWBChicago.com, as Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and his brother Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show “Empire” and worked out with him at the gym.

CWBChicago tweeted an undated photo of director Lee Daniels posing with the muscular brothers on the Empire set.

Schmidt went on to say that her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on Jan. 29 in Chicago — in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beating.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS on Thursday that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being written off the Fox show.

But the reports were disputed by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Two men being questioned in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago are potential suspects in the alleged crime, the city’s police department said on Friday.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.""

Smollett says he was attacked in Chicago late last month, and police earlier this week announced they had two persons of interest in the case.

Police have been investigating the incident as a possible hate crime after Smollett said two men beat him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and placed a rope around his neck.

Authorities said Thursday that they were questioning two persons of interest and that one had previously also appeared on “Empire.” The suspects are brothers and U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, according to reports, and were arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport upon returning from a trip to Nigeria.

Also on Thursday, police shut down rumors that the attack was a hoax, saying they “have no evidence” to support accusations that Smollett fabricated the story.

Police had said initially that phone records they requested provided by Smollett from during the investigation were “not sufficient,” as they were heavily redacted. The actor said that he was on the phone with his manager before the attack and was aiming to protect his privacy.

The actor said in an interview this week that he was “pissed off” that people did not believe his story.

Gloria Schimdt, the attorney representing the two persons of interest, told a Chicago CBS affiliate that the men were “horrified” to hear of the attack on Smollett.

""This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don't want to see somebody go through that,” Schmidt told WBBM. “They really don’t understand how [police] even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they’re not guilty of it."""

According to Chicago Sun-Times, detectives said the men arrested are the same people shown in surveillance images released by police after the alleged attack.

The suspects’ location was reportedly tracked through detective work, including tracing their location through ride-hailing and taxi records in the area of the reported attack.

The men were picked up at O’Hare Airport on Wednesday night and have been questioned by police ever since.

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

UPDATE: Chicago Police Department announced Friday evening, Feb. 15, that it has released the two suspects in the Jussie Smollett case without filing charges. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that detectives had discovered new information through their interviews with the suspects. “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

ORIGINAL STORY: Chicago police have arrested two Nigerian brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, in connection to the Jussie Smollett case based on probable cause that the two may have been involved in an alleged crime, according to TMZ and AP News. While the brothers, whom TMZ claims were both extras on EMPIRE at one point, were previously treated as persons of interest, they are now officially suspects. However, police have yet to charge them.

Jussie Smollett’s team and Chicago police previously quelled a report by ABC 7 in Chicago that claimed the attack was allegedly staged and that it was orchestrated because Smollett was being written off the show. Reps for Smollett told Variety that claims that the attack had been staged were “ridiculous rumors.” In response to the report’s claims that Jussie was being written off the show, 20th Century Fox and Fox Entertainment released a joint statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett also opened up about feeling frustrated that people doubted his story on Good Morning America. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told Robin Roberts. “A lot more.” Smollett was attacked on Jan. 29 around 2 A.M. Two men reportedly yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him up, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

CHICAGO — Jussie Smollett on Tuesday said he redacted some information from his phone before giving it to Chicago police investigating a reported attack on the “Empire” actor in order to protect the privacy of contacts and people who are not relevant to the attack.

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is Black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope."

Smollett, 36, who is gay, has said his attackers were white and that his story would not have been doubted if an attacker had been ""a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black"". He stated that they had punched and kicked him, abused him with homophobic epithets and shouted: ""This is MAGA country.""

Several media outlets have reported that the suspects are Nigerian and TMZ confirmed they are black. It has also emerged that the brothers were extras on the ""Empire"" show in which Smollett stars.

Smollett claimed that the men placed a rope around his neck and threw bleach at him from a hot sauce bottle. Police seized bottles of bleach, a red hat, laptops and an Empire script from the home of the brothers.

On Thursday, Chicago media reported that police were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack. Chicago police officials said this was ""unconfirmed,"" adding that there was “no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Chicago police confirmed Friday that the two men have a “relationship” with Smollett.

Smollett’s representatives have declined to say whether he has identified the men as his attackers.

An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago on Thursday that the men know Smollett from working on the Fox show. She denied that they had assaulted Smollett.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that he was beaten by two men at 2 a.m. in the 300 block of E. North Water Street. He said his attackers yelled racial and homophobic epithets, doused him with bleach, and put a rope around his neck.

Chicago police said Thursday that reports that the event was a hoax are unconfirmed, and were based on incorrect information.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi said. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”"

The feds have been trying to get to the bottom of Jussie Smollet’s brutal attack case and it looks like they finally got somewhere. Two men who happen to be brothers were just arrested and booked for battery, TMZ reports.

Their home was raided by cops on Thursday and seized a long list of potential evidence including several bottles of bleach. Cop picked up Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, on Wednesday night at O’Hare Airport.

According to reports by The Blast, they were recently brought in for questioning. It was revealed that one of the men wasn’t just an acquaintance of the “Empire” star, he was apparently a big fan of Smollett and his music! Just days before the incident in Chicago, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo posted a video of himself listening and flexing in his underwear to Smollett’s hit song, “Ha Ha (I Love You).” On top of that, it was said that Abimbola and his brother Olabinjo were both extras on “Empire.”

Now, this definitely is shocking given the first reports which stated that the suspects where white men and MAGA supporters. These two suspects that police have are Nigerian men.

So what happens next, well, Chicago law enforcement source tells TMZ that the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits.

Police provided no further details, including specific charges or whether the men were the same two men who were taken into custody as “persons of interest” by Chicago police on Wednesday night.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Wednesday those men — reportedly two brothers of Nigerian descent who appeared as extras on “Empire” — were not considered suspects at the time. Their attorney Gloria Schmidt did not immediately respond to calls for comment.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, saying two men approached him on the streets of Chicago and beat him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that the two alleged attackers “batter[ed] the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance” on him. Smollett also said the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.

The alleged attack itself was not captured on video, but police later shared surveillance footage of two men they identified as “persons of interest,” saying they were wanted for questioning in connection to the investigation.

CBS Chicago later reported that police raided the home of the two men on Wednesday night and seized, among other things, “a black face mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.” According to the report, police took the men into custody at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from a trip to Nigeria.

“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,” Gugliemi, the Chicago Police Department spokesperson, said at the time. “They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

In his first public interview since the incident, a sit-down with Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” on Wednesday, Smollett said he was certain the two men in the surveillance footage were the men who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he said. “Never did.”

Smollett also pushed back on those who have questioned his account of the incident, saying that he was “pissed off” at what he called “attacks” from those who may have doubted his account. “Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth,” he told Roberts.

Police have said that Smollett continues to be considered a victim in relation to the investigation, contesting two recent news reports saying investigators have raised the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.

Chicago police released a statement Friday clarifying the latest developments of the ongoing investigation into the alleged hate crime attack on actor and singer Jussie Smollett, best known for his role on the hit series “Empire.” The two men who were taken in for questioning on Wednesday night, police say, are now considered “potential suspects,” while Smollett “continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” Chicago Police Department chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement emailed to CBS Chicago Friday morning. “While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect. For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

The statement comes amid a series of rapidly changing and at times conflicting reports from local Chicago news outlets. On Thursday, multiple outlets including The Chicago Tribune reported that police confirmed that on Wednesday night they detained two “persons of interest” at O’Hare International Airport.

The attorney representing the two potential suspects — whom CBS Chicago says are brothers from Nigeria and worked with Smollett on “Empire” — told the outlet that they have been in custody at Area Central detective headquarters since they were detained Wednesday night at customs at O’Hare after returning from a trip to Nigeria.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified,” Schimdt told CBS. “This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

CBS reports that the two men allegedly left town hours after the reported attack on Smollet on January 29.

Police revealed to reporters that they raided the home of the two men Wednesday night. Images posted online by CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar show the front door apparently kicked in and the apartment strewn with items, including clothing. One photo shows an inventory CBS says was left behind by police. “Some of the items seized include a black face mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach,” the outlet reports.

Below are some of De Mar’s posts on the raid and the two men:

Guglielmi told reporters earlier this week that the “heavily redacted” phone records from the night of the attack provided by Smollett were not sufficient to meet the burden of a criminal investigation. However, according to CWB Chicago, investigators were able to obtain Smollett’s complete phone records “via a subpoena served on his service provider.” Police reportedly used surveillance footage along with phone records to identify the two suspects.

Smollett, who is an openly gay African American, told police that he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. on January 29 while walking home from Subway in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. He says the men assaulted him, calling him “n***er” and “f***ot” and throwing an unknown chemical at him (believed to be bleach). He also says they put a rope around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

(Reuters) - Suspects arrested in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago were released on Friday, police said.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him.

The two men, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are brothers from Nigeria. They were booked for battery, according to TMZ on Friday (February 15).

The internet went wild Thursday as two Chicago media outlets reported that police believed Jussie Smollett wasn’t the victim of a recent attack, but instead, that he and his two supposed attackers staged the incident because the actor was being written off of Empire. The Chicago PD quickly struck those down as “uninformed and inaccurate” reports, while Fox and the Empire team strongly denied any possibility that Smollett, who has starred as Jamal Lyon for all five seasons, would be killed off the show. And while producers insist Smollett isn’t going anywhere, someone is being killed on Empire.

The Fox hit series, which returns for its spring run on March 13, has spent all of season 5 teasing a major death after the premiere ended with a flash forward of Lucious (Terrence Howard) standing over a casket. Speaking with EW after the episode, Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney revealed that the mystery death wouldn’t be solved until the end of the season, but it was an “impactful” one.

The flash forward device has continued to be used throughout the season, but hasn’t shed much light on the identity of the victim, until the winter finale provided a possible answer: eldest Lyon son Andre (Trai Byers) was rushed to the ER and the episode ended with him flatlining. Again speaking to EW, Mahoney wouldn’t confirm that Andre was the person in the coffin, but there have long been rumors that Byers has been looking to leave the show.

Back to Smollett, with the reports about him being written off Empire, co-creator Danny Strong flatly denied those suggestions, writing on social media, “There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed.”

The sentiment was backed up by the Empire writers’ Twitter account and a statement from 20th Century Fox Television: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Talking to EW ahead of the season, Smollett was excited about the “new energy” of the show and an upcoming “groundbreaking” story line, which turned out to be Jamal’s fiancé Kai (Toby Onwumere) being HIV-positive. When asked if he thought Empire was hitting the end of its run, he suggested that it was far from it.

“Let’s get this straight, I’m in it with Jamal for the long run,” declared Smollett. “Obviously it would be up to the network, but I still do feel like we have good wattage in us, because it ain’t been that damn long. But I do think that our stories are firm and grounded. And I definitely would say that I want us to dip out while we’re still telling great stories. My whole thing is this: as long as we’re telling great stories and we’re able to entertain the fans and as long as we’re still excited about doing it then we’ll go. But I think all of us are smart and all of us are artists and all of us will know when the time is right to be, ‘Alright y’all, it’s time for the Lyons to sleep.’ But that time is not now, not with season 5 on the horizon.”

In terms of what is to come with Smollett’s character when Empire returns, Mahoney previously told EW that Jamal will be dealing with Kai asking him to choose between him and his family.

“That is sort of Jamal’s challenge in the past, and it still is,” said the showrunner. “Kai is basically asking, ‘What do you want to be, Jamal? Do you want to be Lucious and Cookie’s son, or do you want to be my husband?’ And Jamal is saying, ‘Listen, I can love you and be a Lyon at the same time. I can’t run away from my family responsibilities.’ That’s a challenge for Jamal and how he defines himself, and something he will have to deal with moving forward.”

According to TMZ, the two men are brothers of Nigerian decent, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo who have also worked as extras on the set of Smollett’s hit show, “Empire.”

The police has reportedly arrested them for battery and are now considering them “potential suspects” in the case. This is a change from the today’s earlier depiction of them as “persons of interest.”

TMZ reports that several bottles of bleach as well as other pieces of potential evidence were found in the Osundairo brothers’ home after a police raid on Thursday. The brothers had just returned from Nigeria and were first picked upon their return to the States on Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.

This evidence is significant because Smollett reported that his attackers put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him during the incident. However, in his account, the 36-year old actor and singer said that the two masked men were white and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him as they repeatedly punched him.

As this situation continues to get more confusing, Smollett will now be forced to identify the men in an official police lineup.

Both men have had guest roles on Chicago television shows and run businesses together. Abel is focused on bodybuilding and fitness. According to the Chicago Tribune, both Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who run a company together, have appeared on “Empire” as extras, which connects them directly to Smollett.

Earlier this week, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America for his first sit down interview where he told Robin Roberts that part of what’s been so painful is dealing with the critics who don’t want to believe the details of his assault.

TMZ first broke the news that the popular actor and singer was hospitalized after being attacked. According to Variety, the officers were informed that the actor “did not want to report the offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.”

Smollett also said he believes that the men featured in the surveillance tape released after the attack are indeed the individuals the police are looking for, however, the police have yet to confirm that the Osundairo brothers are the men in that photo.

Both brothers are active on social media and describe themselves as actors and models.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O’Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was “patently ridiculous,” and that they continue to stand behind him."

Smollett also told the police at the time that the assailants had tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.

But the two people who were arrested are acquaintances of Smollett, a lawyer for the men said. At least one had appeared on “Empire,” a fact that had fueled social media speculation that at least parts of Smollett’s story were not true."

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police “sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two “persons of interest” in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

Hope for Representation: Black Jewish luminaries Tracee Ellis Ross, Rashida Jones, and Jussie Smollett were all nominated for image awards by the NAACP, the JTA reports. Ross, glamorous progeny of Diana Ross and Robert Ellis Silberstein, plays matriarch “Rainbow” on “Blackish,” while Jones is nominated for her documentary on her father, Quincy Jones. Smollett’s who recently survived a horrific attack, stars on “Empire.” Kol hakavod on these honors, you brilliant, beautiful tribe members!

Hope for Remembering: A bill has been reintroduced in the House that would provide funding for Holocaust education in private and public schools. Representative Caroline Maloney, a Democrat hailing from Manhattan’s Upper East Side, reintroduced her “Never Again Education Act,” which would provide an annual $2 million grant from the US treasury to implement and improve Holocaust education in schools, including paying for teachers to attend classes on Holocaust education, the Jewish Week reports. The bill has bi-partisan support.

Hope for Freedom: 16 couples got married in a massive Jewish wedding at the historic Patranato Synagogue in Havana, Cuba. Since the 1959 Marxist revolution, Cubans have suffered a lack of religious freedom. But Jewish life in Cuba has experienced a rebirth ever since Castro loosened religious strictures in the 90’s, and this December, 32 Jewish Cubans celebrated Jewish weddings in one mega-ceremony, through the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. The couples — all of whom were legally married under Cuban law — finally had the opportunity to kiss under one enormous Chuppah. The JDC released the photos of the joyous event in honor of Valentines Day. Mazal tov!

Hope for Knowledge: Berkeley Institute for Jewish Law and Israel Studies received a massive grant for Israel education — so far, events and classes at the Institute have ranged from topics like the Israeli-Arab water crisis to the Jewish response to #MeToo, the JWeekly reports.

Hope for Health:Ruth Bader Ginsburgreturned to the Supreme Court today, after recovering from surgery on nodules in her lungs.

Torah: We break from our regularly scheduled Torah-teaching programming to announce that it is now the Hebrew month of Adar (it has been for a while, in fact) which is the official Jewish month of happiness. This is a very special year because we get two months of Adar — Adar I and Adar II, sort of like a Jewish leap year — which means two time the reminder from the rabbis of the Talmud who said, “Mishenichnas Adar marbin besimchah — When the month of Adar enters, we increase joy.”

The artist, whose real name is Michael Tyler, was freed Wednesday from a Shreveport area correctional complex, local news outlets report.

Tyler, 48, of New Orleans, surrendered in August 2017 when he learned there was a warrant out for his arrest. Tyler was accused of a sexual assault at a Shreveport casino in October 2016 and was indicted on charges of first-degree rape and second-degree kidnapping.

Tyler said he’s pleased to be out. He is best known for his 2000 hit, Shake (it Fast). His 2000 album Let’s Get Ready went multiplatinum.

“It’s a test of faith, you know, walk of faith,” Tyler said after being released. “Sometimes you have to open up the circumstances and it’ll be a walk of faith. This thing here, it could be a tomb where you’re sitting in there deteriorating or it could be a cocoon where you can come out of that thing, I don’t want to say a butterfly, but you could be a hero when you come out of there.”

His lawyer, Joel Pearce, said Tyler’s trial is scheduled for May and that he looks forward to clearing the rapper’s name.

He said that “ultimately whenever the district attorney begins looking at what the facts of the case actually are it’s ultimately gonna be a dismissal.”

“I mean this never happened,” Pearce added.

His lawyers told KTBS-TV they believe they have enough evidence, including video footage, to show Tyler did not commit the alleged crimes.

Jail officials said Tyler’s release was delayed somewhat this week because the bonding agency he used was not initially approved to bond Tyler out, and then there were issues with completing the paperwork.

Rick Farris with the Caddo Correctional Center where Tyler was held said such delays can happen.

“It’s not uncommon that bondsmen come here and is not approved to bond people out and have to go downtown and get all the right paperwork filed with the clerk’s office,” Farris said.

Two other people indicted on other charges arising from the case are still being held at the correctional center, according to jail records.

Smollett: ‘I Just Want Them to Find Them’

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Jan. 29, Smollett went to a doctor after he said he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the statement continued. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Early Thursday morning, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America for his first in-depth, televised interview since the incident occurred.

After detailing what occurred and hitting back at critics who have questioned the accuracy of his account, Smollett got emotional, confessing his fears that his assailants won’t be found.

The Chicago Police Department had confirmed that Smollett, who is gay, was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“I want that [surveillance] video found so badly for four reasons,” Smollett said in the interview. “Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ‘alleged attack.’ Number three, I want them to see that I fought back. And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back. It does not take anything away from people who are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn’t.”

“Learn to fight. Learn to be a fighter,” he continued, addressing young gay men. “I am not advocating violence at all, so let’s be clear about that. If you’re going to die, fight until you do. If you don’t fight, you have no chance. I have fought for love. I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way.”

After being asked if one can heal if their attackers are never found, Smollett broke down.

“I don’t know. Let’s just hope that they are, you know what I’m saying? Let’s not go there yet,” he said, crying.

“I was talking to a friend and I said, ‘I just want them to find them.’ And she said, ‘Sweetie, they’re not going to find them,’ ” he said. “That just made me so angry. So I’m just going to be left here like this? I’m just going to be left here? They get to go free, go about their life, and possibly attack someone else. And I’m here left with the aftermath? That’s not cool to me. That’s not okay.”"

The Latest: 2 questioned in Smollett attack now suspects

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects. Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not been charged in the Jan. 29 attack. Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home. Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity. Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

So…they’ve arrested two black guys who live in the gayest neighborhood in Chicago, one of whom actually worked on Smollett’s tv show, Empire, and who know Smollett personally, Ubered over in the middle of a cold, dark night to pretend to be white guys in order to attack him?

Pull the other one.

They’ve been arrested for complicity in Jussie’s false flag hoax, and the pols are desperately trying to figure out what next.

The issue is what to do about Smollett. They can do nothing, and bring these two guys to court on charges of the hoax. I don’t see how that flies, but, hey, it’s Chicago.

They can get a confession out of Jussie. It would be along the lines of, “Oh, I was driven insane by the evil of BadManOrange, and felt I had to do something, anything to stop the man from hurting mah peeples.” Followed by a slap on the wrist, some therapy, and back to being a big hero.

They can arrest him, bring him to court, and try to convict him. I think the court/convict part of that is somewhat less probable.

UPDATE: TMZ is reporting both men have been booked on charges of “battery.” It’s TMS, and it makes almost no sense, but what the hell? It’s Chicage SJW crazy."

The men have not been charged with a crime, and spokesman Anthony Guglielmi did not say what charges they might face. The two men — whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on ""Empire,"" according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man's job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi's comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett's neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

After being questioned at length yesterday, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo are now in custody.

“We can confirm that they have been arrested but they have not been charged,” Chicago PD PIO News Affairs official Sally Born told Deadline today.The two have been brought in formally on suspicion of assault and battery.

At least one of the brothers, who were picked up returning to Chicago at O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday, has appeared as an extra on the Windy City-filmed Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime,” said Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi Friday of the arrested duo.

“Victim” Smollett is “continuing to cooperate” with the investigation, a police source told Deadline, adding that the brothers did know the actor, though how well is unclear at present. Smollett is expected to be asked later today to identify the duo at some point, whether in a line-up or in some other manner.

This latest twist in the attack on the Empire star also comes one day after local media were scolded by police for “unconfirmed” and “inaccurate” reports that the alleged assault on Smollett more than two weeks ago in the Windy City was staged as a career move. Almost simultaneously, Empire broadcaster Fox soundly pushed back against suggestions that the actor who plays openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hip hop drama was being written off the series, a reason given in reports earlier in the day claiming the attack was staged.

At around 2 AM on the morning of January 29 two men began screaming derogatory slurs at Smollet on the street near where he lives when Empire is in production in the MidWest metropolis. The two men then started hitting the actor over and over with their fists. They are also said to have poured an unknown chemical substance over him now thought to have been bleach.

Additionally, the duo were said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before leaving the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital to be seen by doctors. Bruised but not admitted to the facility, the facially cut and bruised actor returned to his local apartment a few hours later and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Soon afterwards, the Chicago PD said they were treating the incident as a “possible hate crime.” On January 31, one day after local law enforcement released photos of “persons of interest” in the matter, Guglielmi referred to the matter as an “assault and battery case.”

On the day of the attack, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement they were “deeply saddened and outraged” by the assault.

A few days later, in the opening minutes of a gig at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on February 2, Smollett directly addressed the attack As the FBI-assisted investigation continued back in Chicago, the performer told the packed club: “I had to be here tonight!”

“I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win!”

In more recent days, Smollett gave an emotional sit-down interview to Good Morning America, his first since the January 29 attack. Earlier this week Smollett handed over phone records from within the hour of the 2 AM incident. GMA‘s Robin Roberts noted in the interview segment that Chicago police said the records were “limited and heavily redacted.”

Asked about the doubts and rumors that have sprung up on social media and elsewhere since the attack, Smollett said, “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

Following the GMA interview, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis released a statement saying that Smollett has been “doubly victimized” by the doubt and speculation in the media “and broader culture.”"

The brothers, who are from Nigeria but played high school athletics in Illinois, were named by TMZ, which alleges they were booked “for battery.” Their first names appear in a search warrant published by a Chicago television reporter.

On February 20, 2019, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct and accused of filing a false report.

“Case Update: Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” the Chicago police spokesman wrote on the evening of February 15, 2019. However, Chicago police later told Entertainment Weekly: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

This, and other reporting that alleged police were investigating whether Smollett paid the brothers to stage the attack, led to a furious denial from Smollett, who told EW: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” His lawyers told the entertainment site that one of the brothers was his personal trainer for a music video.

Police took bleach, shoes electronics and more.Officers asked family if they knew #Jussiesmollett. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/PDSFtf5jwb — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 14, 2019

Both men have had guest roles on Chicago television shows and run businesses together. Abel is focused on bodybuilding and fitness. According to the Chicago Tribune, police, after first labeling the brothers persons of interest, are now calling them “potential suspects” and say that detectives have “probable cause” that they may have committed a crime. They have not been criminally charged, and authorities have said little else. The men are under arrest, per Charlie De Mar, a reporter for Chicago CBS. In what now comes across as unintentional irony, Abel’s YouTube Channel even contains a YouTube video that is labeled as Ola’s “interrogation scene.”

“When they first learned about what happened to him (Smollett) they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” the attorney for the brothers told CBS Chicago. The lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, also told CBS Chicago that her clients “are baffled about why they are people of interest. It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys

Since Jussie Smollett alleged to Chicago police that he was attacked, numerous questions have been raised about his story. Chicago police previously released a grainy surveillance video that they said contained the images of two people who were in the area at the time. Smollett previously told ABC that the persons of interest in the grainy video were his alleged attackers: “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.” It’s not clear whether police think the brothers are the people in the grainy POI photos, though.

Yet even his own attorney acknowledges that Smollett knows Abimbola Osundairo and his brother through the Empire television program. TMZ is reporting that Smollett may be asked to identify his attackers in a line-up but notes that Smollett said his attackers were white. The Osundairo brothers are black.

The development came after Smollett went on television and reiterated that he was attacked, saying, “I want to believe, with everything that has happened, that there is something called justice.”

However, Charlie DeMar, CBS Chicago reporter, wrote, “UPDATE: Attorney for two men in custody says she spoke with CPD detectives and charges (at least against the two brothers In custody) are expected before 5:45pm Friday. That is when the 48-Hour hold expires.”

Here’s what you need to know:

1. The Osundairo Brothers Sold ‘Winter Face Masks’ & Run a Chicago-area Party Supply Store

On Facebook, Abel Osundairo and his brother sold winter face masks. (Smollett had claimed his alleged attackers wore masks). “Winter face masks $20 + free shipping,” an advertisement on Facebook says. They also advertised black hoodies. The men, who are from Nigeria, registered an LLC called “PARTY TIME. THE B’S OSUNDAIRO, LLC.” They have a limited business license to sell retail merchandise through the Chicago-based store.

One reviewer on Yelp for the Party Time store wrote, “Had to put together a last minute party and needed something close and reasonably priced. This place was awesome, it’s in the strip mall on Kimball and Irving. I was able to get all the balloons and favors I needed etc. They also have Trump piñatas!” You can see photos of their store here.

On Instagram, Abel Osundairo also posted a picture in traditional Nigerian clothing, writing, “Happy Nigerian ?? Independence Day.”

Some of his posts are religious in nature. “TEAM ABEL…ABEL to do any and all things through our lord and savior Jesus Christ. We are undefined. There are no limits to what we can do and to what we will accomplish. And all of this is through the Grace of G-D,” he wrote on Instagram. “We glorify YOU and will continue to do so by our works and by being stewards of the universe InshaAllah.”

On Instagram, Jussie Smollett is listed as following 616 pages. Osundairo’s Team Abel page is one of them.

Anthony Guglieli, the Chicago police spokesman, revealed on February 14, 2019 that authorities had determined the identities of the two persons of interest. However, he stressed that police were not calling them suspects. However, he also confirmed (without naming the brothers) that they were being questioned. That statement was later updated via email, per the Chicago Tribune, to call the brothers potential suspects.

“To safeguard the investigation, details about the case including timelines & backgrounds of those being questioned by police will not be released or commented on while detectives question persons of interest. Media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time,” the police spokesman previously wrote on Twitter.

He added: “Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

He also wrote, “Through a meticulous investigation, #ChicagoPolice detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.” Again, that was before the “potential suspects” police update came out, though.

When authorities first released the grainy POI photos, they wrote, “Photos of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member. While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed.”

2. A Chicago Reporter Alleges the Attack May Have Been Staged But Police Have Not Confirmed This Accusation & Say They Don’t Have Evidence of a ‘Hoax’

Rob Elgas, a reporter for ABC 7 in Chicago, has been tweeting numerous questions and alleged discrepancies in Smollett’s accounts. Keep in mind that authorities have confirmed none of this information, and these contentions remain unconfirmed accusations. Elgas wrote that police were investigating whether the attack was staged.

Chicago police said, though, that they have “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect. For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” Guglielmi wrote in an email to CBS Chicago.

The Empire Writers and police pushed back on Twitter at earlier reports that police were investigating whether the attack was staged because Smollett was allegedly going to be written off the show, with the Empire Writers tweeting, “The writers of Empire have never planned or even discussed writing @JussieSmollett off of the show.”

Guglielmi, the Chicago police spokesman, then wrote on Twitter, “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

ABC 7 later reported that Smollett released a statement saying, “Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate” and stating he was not being written off the show.

In a statement also reported by ABC 7, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment wrote, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

CNN reported that a law enforcement source said that Uber and Yellow Cab helped police pinpoint the persons of interest’s movements that night.

According to AP, Smollett gave Chicago police his phone records but only in redacted form that police deemed insufficient.

3. At Least One Brother Appeared on the Show Empire as an Extra & Abel Is a Bodybuilder

On Facebook, Ola Osundairo wrote that he was “Head of Security at Whiskey Business,” and lives in Chicago, Illinois, coming from Lagos, Nigeria. On Instagram, Abel Osundairo wrote with his profile: “God is Great. Actor ? Building the best Natural Physique on the ?. Email ?? for online coaching.”

Ola acted in a 2015 episode of “Empire,” playing Chris Rock’s prison bodyguard. In an interview with a Quincy University television program, Ola said, “I played a prison inmate. I was handpicked by the director to play as Chris Rock’s bodyguard in prison. I actually started watching the show when I was cast to be on it. Ever since then I have been staying tuned.” Ola Osundairo has a YouTube channel with a couple of videos on it.

“My time at QU prepared me and taught me how to conduct myself and behave professionally around a large group of people.” said Osundairo in the Quincy interview. “On set you meet so many people that you have been watching on TV your whole life, and to actually hold a conversation with them is intimidating at first.”

On Instagram, Abel Osundairo posted a photo of his brother in orange prison dress from what appeared to be an Empire scene, writing, “Ummmm … #prisonlife? ? #freelucious #empireseason2 #day1 #bigdaddylostintheyard ?”

On January 9, Abel used a Smollett song with a posing video:

“Practicing my posing routine with an unexpected visitor ? @inbaglobal_official he wants to be in the show. What do you say? Song by: @jussiesmollett ha ha (i love you),” he wrote on Instagram.

The brothers appear to have lived in Illinois since at least high school. Quincy University’s 2012 roster says, “Abimbola was born Sept. 4, 1993… he is the son of Lanre Osundairo… he has two brothers… his brother, Olabinjo, is a running back for the Hawks.” The site adds that Abel Osundairo “participated in football, track and field, soccer and wrestling at Lakeview High School” in Illinois.

The Quincy University website provides these stats for Abimbola Osundairo:

“2013: Played in all 11 games…Recorded 33 total tackles…Had 2.5 tackles for-a-loss…Recovered 2 fumbles returning one for a touchdown against Kentucky Wesleyan College.

2012: Played in 11 games at defensive back… Recorded 20 tackles and forced one fumble on the season… Named to GLVC Academic All-Conference.

2011: Osundairo did not see varsity action.”

Abimbola Usundairo also posted video of a commercial with Mike Ditka.

Abel Osundairo filled his Instagram page with bodybuilding pictures. One picture showed him at a bodybuilding competition holding a large award. “When it’s all said and done, what will you be remembered by? This past weekend was one for the books. ✅” he wrote in the caption.

“I’m officially 6 weeks out from my Professional natural bodybuilding show debut (men’s physique),” he wrote with one bodybuilding picture. “I’m excited and can’t wait but there’s still plenty more work that needs to be done. It’s really time to dial in and to remain focused, to have no distractions, no succumbing to temptations, and making it a priority to be patient with people when I’m short on carbs ???”

Abel posted scenes from acting roles. His Instagram profile links to this YouTube channel.

Their attorney Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago that Smollett knows the men.

“They do know Jussie,” she said to the television station. “They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

Also on the inventory list taken from the brothers home was “Script-Empire.” Attorney says men have appeared as extras on #Empire. #Jussiesmollett #Jussiesmollett @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/ijiSV18j6n — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 15, 2019

However, other accounts alleged only one of the persons of interest has a tie to the show.

Elgas also alleged, “One of those persons of interest has appeared on Empire. Smollett is also being questioned by police. Chicago police have no new comment. No one has been charged.”

Again, this information has not been confirmed by authorities.

4. The Men Are Accused of Leaving for Nigeria the Day of the Attack, According to Media Reports & Police Raided Their Homes

TMZ alleged that the family of the two persons of interest said they “left for Nigeria the day of the alleged attack. This is consistent with what law enforcement sources previously told TMZ … that the men left for Nigeria and returned Wednesday night, and the police tracked their travels and were waiting for them when they landed in Chicago.”

On Instagram on February 1, 2019, Abel posted a video of himself that he said was in Ogun, Nigeria.

Charlie DeMar, a CBS Chicago reporter, wrote, “BREAKING: Police raided the home of two persons of interest in Jussie Smollett case last night. Both men are of Nigerian descent and have appeared as extras on the show. Police took bleach, shoes electronics and more. Officers asked family if they knew #Jussiesmollett. @cbschicago.”

According to ABC 7, in a search of the men’s homes, “Police removed shoes, electronic devices and other items they believe could help them they determine if the two people played any role in the assault from those homes.”

TMZ also reported that Smollett never alleged that the men he said attacked him were wearing MAGA hats, but, rather, he alleged that they screamed MAGA country at him.

WGN-TV also reported that the two men “were picked upon their arrival at O’Hare International Airport Thursday. Both of them are African American, and at least one of them has a connection to the ‘Empire’ actor.”

5. Abel Osundairo Wrote That He Appeared on the TV Show Chicago PD, Calling Himself ‘the Hottest Nigerian You Know’

In what now seems ironic, Abel wrote on Instagram that he’d appeared on the television show Chicago PD. He wrote on Instagram, “Tonight’s the night. Drop your food, drop your drinks, drop your babies and tune into NBC’s Chicago P.D to see if I’ll be working with Chicago’s finest or will I be on the other side of the law ☻?☻” In February 2018, he wrote, “You can’t afford to miss next week’s episode of Chicago p.d where the hottest Nigerian you know will be guest starring.”

“Tune in to Chicago PD tonight on NBC and catch me and an awesome cast bring the story of Kenny to life,” he wrote on November 14, 2018. That October, he posted a picture of himself in a Chicago PD director’s chair and wrote, “Issa wrap. Had an amazing time and experience on the set of Chicago PD. Awesome crew and great actors. Stay in tune and watch Chicago PD every Wednesday night 10/9 central on NBC.”

Ola Osundairo has an IMDB profile that mentions Chicago PD.

Abel also posted pictures of scenes.

The story that Smollett gave was horrific, and it sparked a round of empathetic responses from celebrities and others at first. According to WGN-TV, he said that, while walking in Chicago near his apartment in the early morning hours of January 29, two men approached him and placed a rope around his neck and tossed a substance on him.

According to CNN, Smollett said: “So I turned around and said ‘What the f**k did you just say to me’ and I see the attacker masked. He said ‘This MAGA country n****r’ and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.”

To CNN, he denied ever saying the men were wearing MAGA hats: “I never said that. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

He further alleged they were masked and “beat him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults,” reported WGN. According to the television station, Smollett “had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck” when police arrived. However, reports say, Smollett did not initially tell police the “MAGA” comment accusation, but later did.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s manager, later backed up Smollett’s story, telling Variety he was on the phone with Smollett and heard some of the negative remarks directed at him by alleged attackers, “I heard that clearly. I had the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.”"

The men have not been charged with a crime, and spokesman Anthony Guglielmi did not say what charges they might face. The two men — whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Chicago PD says, ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charging.""

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi added that detectives have ""additional investigative work to complete.""

Police have now arrested 2 men in the Jussie Smollett investigation -- 2 men with ties to ""Empire"" -- and TMZ has learned they were booked for battery.

The men are brothers from Nigeria named Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, and Chicago cops are now calling them ""potential suspects"" ... as opposed to persons of interest. We know it was their home cops raided Wednesday and seized a long list of potential evidence ... including several bottles of bleach.

As we reported ... cops picked up Ola and Abel, their nicknames, on Wednesday night at O'Hare Airport.

A Chicago law enforcement source tells us the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits. This raises a potential problem because, as we first reported, Jussie initially said his attackers were white and yelled ""MAGA country.""

The Osundairos, from Nigeria, just don't fit that profile.

As you know, Jussie has stated the men in the dark, grainy image released last month are definitely his attackers. Police are not confirming the Osundairo brothers are the men in that photo.

Ola played a prison inmate on season 2 of ""Empire."" It's unclear exactly how well they know Jussie, but we know Jussie follows their joint Instagram account. Abel also says he's worked on ""Empire.""

Both brothers describe themselves online as actors and models."

ABC News(CHICAGO) — Two suspects in the alleged racial attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett were arrested Friday, Chicago police said.

“Police can detain the potential suspects for an additional 24 hours past the 48 hour holding period under special circumstances, but it must go through the prosecutors office and has to be clear process,” police added to ABC News.

Police also confirmed “they have a relationship with [Jussie].”

This news comes hours after police told ABC News they were classifying them as potential suspects.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police said.

They also shut down any reports that there was evidence to classify the alleged attack as a hoax.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” police added. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Chicago PD had confirmed Thursday that they identified and were questioning the two “persons of interest” in the alleged racial attack. One of them has previously appeared on Empire, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Police say they were tracking the two suspects and were aware of who they were “for a while,” and that investigators learned that the two individuals were returning to Chicago on Wednesday from Nigeria.

The two suspects are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, they added.

Detectives also questioned Smollett Thursday, the official said.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt, who is representing the two persons of interest, told Chicago CBS station WBBM that her clients were detained at O’Hare Airport Wednesday evening and were unaware of the attack on Smollett.

“When they first learned what happened to him, they were horrified,” Schmidt said. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that … They really don’t understand how [police] even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they’re not guilty of it.”

Late last month, Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s Empire, told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to police. Smollett said the attackers also yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said on Good Morning America that he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

By Gabriella Borter

(Reuters) - Suspects arrested in connection with an alleged racist and homophobic assault on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago were released on Friday, police said.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him."

Barely a day and a half after his disastrous Tulsa rally, which less than 6200 people attended, according to an official estimate, the President is clearly concerned about his re-election prospects.

Monday morning President Trump tweeted out a link to a far right wing website quoting Attorney General Bill Barr’s false claim voting by mail “absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud.”

The President added: “This will be the Election disaster of our time. Mail-In Ballots will lead to a RIGGED ELECTION!”

There is zero evidence of this.

Minutes later, Trump fired off an all-caps tweet, insisting – again without evidence – foreign countries will print “millions” of mail-in ballots, rigging the election.

RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2020

Five states are vote-by-mail only: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Several other states offer vote-by-mail. There is nearly zero voter fraud.

On Twitter some noted the safeguards in place to prevent voter fraud.

FACT CHECK: Absentee/mail-in ballots are printed with bar codes for tracking. CONTEXT ALERT: @realDonaldTrump is the only candidate for president who has repeatedly solicited foreign assistance for his re-election campaign. https://t.co/XlSebORsXf — Andrew Feinberg (@AndrewFeinberg) June 22, 2020

Others accused Trump of lying.

Some noted Trump knows he’s going to lose the election.

Trump knows he’s gonna lose big time, so he’s already creating the excuse why. We’ve had mail-in voting for many previous elections. Trump votes by mail. Don’t let him gaslight you! — Mrs. Krassenstein (@HKrassenstein) June 22, 2020

Some warned Trump might not leave quietly.

Trump telling us on June 22, 2020 he will NOT be accepting the election results come November 3. Does anyone think There will be a normal transition of power come January?! There won't be. But I can 100% assure you that Trump will be removed from White House Jan 20, 2021 at Noon — (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) June 22, 2020

Some expressed grave concern.

this genuinely scares the shit out of me, I just hope it’s a bunch of bluster https://t.co/Gm5OdnF59u — Dylan Scott (@dylanlscott) June 22, 2020

If mail-in ballots are disproportionately sought by Democrats, election night counts may show Trump leading in some states, only for that lead to vanish as mail-in ballots are counted. Trump is telegraphing how he might respond to that. Pretty scary stuff. https://t.co/Daq3KGBvMf — Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) June 22, 2020

Some warned he might be planning to contest the election.

Trump's laying the groundwork for an election challenge. Barr's corrupt enough to help him do it. That's why the House must impeach Barr. Even if the Senate won't convict it puts down a historical marker that this is not OK and creates a factual record exposing Barr's corruption. https://t.co/tj5bU7gyrr — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) June 22, 2020

This tweet serves two purposes. 1) It makes his base weary of the election results, and 2) It's a direct request to China and Russia to print out and send in fake mail-in ballots in order to create a scandal surrounding his election loss. He'll then claim he predicted this. https://t.co/5aRAXneLox — Mrs. Krassenstein (@HKrassenstein) June 22, 2020

And some accused him of engaging in voter suppression.

After Trump's Tulsa flop of a rally where he had less than a third turnout, Trump now is 100% sure he can NOT win in November if it's his base versus Americans. So now Trump pivots hard to voter suppression and trying to delegitimize the results of the election https://t.co/hTR4zwD9RW — (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) June 22, 2020

And so begins the 2020 Trump campaign voter suppression effort. When he loses he needs to lose big, because this clown will just moan about 'voter fraud' in November.

The crime in certain parts of the city is out of control just like it was under Garry McCarthy. Instead of Johnson fixing the problem by finding a new strategy to police the city effectively; Johnson has used the same old talking points as Superintendents before him by saying crime is down and things are improving in the right direction.

Even worse, is the Chicago police pitiful handling of the Jussie Smollett case. From day one, several Chicago police officers/ spokesman have leaked information to the media to make it appear that Smollett was lying about his report of being assaulted.

The Chicago police started by saying they did not have video evidence that an assault took place and the two persons of interest in the video was never seen crossing the street where Smollett was walking. The police went further to make it appear Smollett was lying by saying there’s video of him wearing a rope while walking down the street as their way of hinting that the event was staged.

Superintendent Johnson in several interviews and statements have stated that the Chicago police has no reason to believe Smollett was lying, but the officers in his out-of-control department keeps hinting otherwise to the media.

Yesterday, several people inside the Chicago police department told the media that one of the two persons of interest appeared on the television show Empire with Smollett. Then later in the day, the several people inside the CPD told the media that CPD were investigating rather the men in the video and Smollett made up the story to keep Smollett from being written off the show.

Superintendent Johnson quickly called ABC 7 Chicago to state on the record that the reports of Smollett being investigated was inaccurate. The production company and the writers of Empire have called the reports of Smollett being possibly written off the show ridiculous. My question is what would make the CPD believe he was being written off the show without speaking to the show’s head writer, producer or production company.

Either way, Superintendent Johnson needs to get control of the case and stop the leaks. The constant leaks followed by him disputing what is being leaked makes it look like he has lost control of his department."
143,https://www.wmagazine.com/story/jussie-smollett-attack-hoax-empire-chicago-police-department,,Theory That Jussie Smollett’s Attack Was a “Hoax” Being Disputed by Empire and Chicago Police Department,[],"https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5853eebb9c190ec57ac0a77a/2:1/w_790,c_limit/Jussie-Smollett.jpg?mbid=social_retweet","['smollett', 'likely', 'jussie', 'empire', 'smolletts', 'reports', 'outrage', 'chicago', 'disputed', 'tweeted', 'attack', 'theory', 'incident', 'department', 'written', 'hoax']","Almost immediately after news broke at the end of last month that two men had attacked Jussie Smollett, an actor on Empire, controversy over how to characterize the incident has practically been as rampant as the outrage. That sense of outrage was only fanned by descriptions of the attack—which the Chicago Police Department initially said it investigating as a ""possible hate crime""—as ""racially charged,"" rather than simply racist. (In addition to pouring bleach on his face, the attackers, who Smollett said yelled racial and homophobic slurs, as well as the phrase ""MAGA country,"" also tied a rope around his neck, which led some to describe the attack as ""an attempted modern-day lynching."")

It wasn't until Thursday, though, that reports broke which seemed to give credence to another characterization of the attack: that it was a hoax. Chicago's CBS and ABC affiliates both shared reports alleging that Smollett had worked with his two attackers—one of whom, the reports alleged, was also an actor on Empire—to stage the incident, motivated by another allegation that Smollett was being written off of the show.

But that, according to the show's co-creator, Danny Strong, was never the case: ""There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false,"" he tweeted on Thursday. ""He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed.""

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the show, also tweeted and shared a statement with USA Today which read, ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Not all of those who spoke out against the reports stuck to simply Empire's plot points. While the Chicago Police Department's chief communications officer, Anthony Guglielmi, originally tweeted a reminder that because investigators continue to safeguard details of the incident, ""media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time."" A few hours later, though, he got a bit more specific: ""Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" he tweeted.

While Guglielmi told the New York Times later that night that one of the men being questioned in connection with the attack—though who is not currently being considered a suspect—did appear on Empire, he also said that the ""supposed CPD sources"" cited by the ABC affiliate which was among the first to share the reports ""are uninformed and inaccurate."" He also added that the CPD's superintendent, Eddie Johnson, had since reached out to the station to ""state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting.""

Each tweet was met with a mixed response; many replies expressed their doubts and frustration with the continued lack of clarity surrounding the incident via memes (""Sure, Jan"" and Oprah asking, ""So what is the truth?""). Even before the reports broke, so many have conspired that Smollett is lying about the attack that he addressed and expressed his frustrations with those allegations himself during his appearance on Good Morning America on Thursday. (Though some remained unconvinced, pointing to the fact that the phone records which Smollett submitted to the police were, in the words of Chicago law enforcement, ""limited and heavily redacted."")

But why is it so hard to believe that such an attack could have taken place? In 2016, the FBI found that LGBT individuals are the most likely targets of hate crimes in America—and that black individuals are the fourth most likely, as much of the outrage surrounding descriptions of the attack as ""racially charged"" has pointed out. The overwhelming number of those individuals, of course, are not celebrities, and therefore names that you'll likely never come across the news—particularly now that the attack against Smollett has proven that even a known name faces little chance of being believed.

Smollett, however, is standing his ground; less than a week after the attack, he encouraged the audience gathered at his performance in Los Angeles to ""be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the fuck you want to be.""

CBS Chicago reports:

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two men whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire.” He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama. He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett continues to be treated by police as a victim and not a suspect."

Ola was taken into custody at O’Hare Airport on February 13 along with his brother, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo. In addition to being bodybuilders, the pair are also aspiring actors. TMZ reports that both brothers have been “booked for batter.”

On January 29, Smollett told police in Chicago that he had been assaulted while leaving a Subway restaurant, close to the actor’s apartment on North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. The “Empire” actor described his assailants as being clad in black and wearing ski masks. TMZ was the first report that Smollett told cops his attackers referred to him as a “n*****” and a “f*****.” On February 1, Abel Osundairo posted a video to Instagram showing him in Nigeria. In January 2019, Abel posted a video to Instagram using Smollett’s song “Ha Ha (I Love You) as a backing track.

Ola and Abel’s lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS Chicago that her clients “are baffled about why they are people of interest. It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.” Schmidt also said that Smollett and the Osundairo brothers are familiar to each other from the gym.

As news broke that the pair was in custody, multiple reports surfaced alleging that the attack had been staged as Smollett was to be written out of “Empire.” Those reports were met with immediate pushback from the Chicago Police Department, as well as the writers and producers of the show. The show’s creators said there were no plans to write Smollet out of the show.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. Ola & Abel Modeled ‘Winter Face Masks’ for Sale on Facebook

In December 2018, Ola uploaded a picture of him and his brother modeling “Winter Face Masks” for $20 to Facebook. The pair also modeled hooded sweatshirts, vests and baseball caps with the logo “Team Abel,” which is Abel’s Instagram handle.

Ola gives his nickname as “Juice” on Facebook. Ola says that between 2014 and 2017, he studied Business and Finance at Keller Graduate School of Management in Naperville, Illinois. Since May 2017, Ola has worked as a bouncer at Whiskey Business, a bar in Chicago. For a time, Ola and Abel ran a now-defunct party store, Party Time, in the Iriving Park area of Chicago, according to public records.

A postitive Yelp review of the store read, “Had to put together a last minute party and needed something close and reasonably priced. This place was awesome, it’s in the strip mall on Kimball and Irving. I was able to get all the balloons and favors I needed etc. They also have Trump piñatas!”

2. Ola Appeared in ‘Empire’ as Chris Rock’s Bodyguard & Has Bemoaned Nigerians Playing Criminals on TV

Monologue 2016-11-22T16:36:33.000Z

Ola appeared in a 2015 episode of “Empire” as Chris Rock’s prison bodyguard. In an interview with the TV channel of his alma-mater, Quincy University, Ola said, “I played a prison inmate. I was handpicked by the director to play as Chris Rock’s bodyguard in prison. I actually started watching the show when I was cast to be on it. Ever since then I have been staying tuned.”

Quincy University is a private Catholic college in Quincy, Illinois. Ola is represented by BNB-Chicago Model and Talent Agency. On his IMDb page, Ola says that he appeared in the February 2018 episode of “Chicago PD” titled “Anthem” and a movie named “The Worst Nightmare.” Abel has also appeared in an episode of “Chicago PD.”

Ola went on to say that his goal was to be in Hollywood and that his role in “Empire” was “just the beginning.” Ola said he was working on independent movies. He says, “By the grace of God I plan on taking this acting career as far as I can.” Ola has a YouTube channelsun with three videos that see him acting in a variety of scenes.

Ola bemoaned what he viewed as the typecasting of Nigerian actors in TV and movies in a November 2018 Facebook post where he wrote, “SMH. They always got the Nigerians ?? portrayed as criminals on t.v. We gotta do better and say no to the money and fame ✊??.”

3. Ola Was Also Trying to Become a Rap Artist

In the past Ola has tried to forge a rap career going under the monikers King Ola and Juice Man. A Twitter account for his career has not been active since 2016 and a Soundcloud page for his music has been inactive for five years. His song titles included, “My N****s Right Here,” “Scandalous” and “You a Lie.”

4. Ola & Abel Were Football Players at Quincy

Ola and his brother were both football players at Quincy University, having also attended Lakeview High School in Chicago together. According to Ola’s official profile on the school’s website, he played a total of four games at varsity level during his time at the school between 2011 and 2014. In the 2013 season, Ola recorded a solo tackle. That profile describes Ola has having two brothers, one of whom, Abel, was a defensive back for the Quincy Hawks. The bio also says that Ola attended Latmos Comprehensive College in Lagos, Nigeria. The piece names their father as Lanre Osundairo.

Ola the school’s website in 2015, “My time at QU prepared me and taught me how to conduct myself and behave professionally around a large group of people. On set you meet so many people that you have been watching on TV your whole life, and to actually hold a conversation with them is intimidating at first. Your personality is very important when it comes to acting, and QU plays a huge role in who I am today.” According to Ola’s LinkedIn page, he graduated from Quincy in 2014 after studying business management. He lists his activities and societies as being an NCAA Student-Athlete and a member of the Brothers of Unity fraternity.

5. Smollett’s Manager Brandon Z. Moore Said He Heard the Actor’s Attackers Say ‘This is MAGA Country’

In addition to the physical attack, Smollett also said that his accusers threw bleach over him and put a noose around his neck. When Smollett is seen on surveillance footage, police said he was “wearing a rope like a necktie.” A police spokesperson told the Chicago Sun-Times on January 30 that the rope “didn’t necessarily resemble a noose.” Another police source told CWB Chicago that the noose was “thin clothesline, straight out of the package.”

Ola and Abel are the same two men who were featured in the grainy pictures that were released by the Chicago Police Department. Public safety group CWB Chicago tweeted in response to the release of the photos, “A consideration regarding the ‘potential persons of interest’ being sought by police in connection with reported hate crime incident in Streeterville: The men are walking *away* from the attack scene 15-30 minutes *before* the incident, per police timing of events.” Police were called to Smollett’s friend’s apartment around 2:30 a.m. on January 29 by a friend of the actor. It is not clear if that residence is located in the same building that the actor lives in.

Smollett’s manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told police that he was on the phone with the actor when the attack took place. Moore says he heard the men shout, “This is MAGA country.” as well as a racial slur. Smollett said in an interview on “Good Morning America” on February 14 that the reports about the attackers referring to “Make America Great Again” were inaccurate.

Speaking to Variety, Moore backed up Smollett’s story saying, “I heard that clearly. I had the scuffle and I heard the racial slur.” The Variety report says that Moore would not go into more detail because of the pending investigation.

Police later said that the phone records that Smollett provided to prove this phone call took place were deemed as insufficient.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as the victim, not a suspect. The investigation continues.""

Chicago police have said they are investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime.

Smollett told police he was attacked around 2am on Jan 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance, which he believes to be bleach, on him.

According to Smollett, at least one assailant told him ""this is MAGA country"" during the attack.

In his statement, Guglielmi said police will continue interviews on Friday with two people of interest, who appeared in surveillance images released earlier this month.

Chicago police said on Thursday that they had identified the individuals in the images.

""The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,"" Guglielmi tweeted. ""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives.""

On Thursday evening, CBS Chicago - citing an unnamed ""source with intimate knowledge of the investigation"" - reported that investigators believe Smollett and two ""non-cooperating witnesses"" had staged the attack.

ABC7, meanwhile, published a report citing ""multiple sources"" who told the ABC affiliate that police were investigating whether the actor and the ""two persons of interest"" had ""staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off Empire.""

In a tweet on Thursday night, Guglielmi said the hoax reports were ""unconfirmed by case detectives.""

He noted that police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who told ABC7 earlier this month that Smollett ""had been cooperative"" in the investigation, had followed up with them ""to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed (Chicago Police Department) sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment also responded to the reports in a strongly worded statement: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Several of Smollett's Empire colleagues, including co-creator Danny Strong, also denied the show had considered writing off the actor's character, Jamal Lyon, an openly gay R&B artist.

The hoax reports surfaced on the same day Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett, who talked in detail for the first time about the alleged attack.

Smollett appeared emotional as he spoke to ABC's Robin Roberts. He said he was ""p****d off"" about the attack - and at critics doubting his account.

""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, because it's the truth,'"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that. It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'""

WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE

The actor told Roberts he believed some doubted his story because he said his attackers referenced US President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan (MAGA).

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me... a lot more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett also said some media reports about his alleged assault were inaccurate. He said, for example, he never told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

He explained some of the more scrutinised details of the case, including why he did not change his clothes or remove the rope from his neck after the attack (""I wanted (the police) to see what this was,"" he told Roberts.)

Smollett also explained his initial hesitation - referenced in the police report - to go to police about the attack. ""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,"" he said. ""And I'm not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.""

Outside of acting, Smollett has established himself as an activist, working alongside organisations dedicated to HIV/Aids awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy - a background he referenced while addressing the scepticism surrounding his claims.

""I'm an advocate. I respect too much the people - who I am now one of those people - who have been attacked in any way,"" he told Roberts.

""You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this."""

According to CBS Chicago, Chicago police tweeted that reports about the “incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.” Police released a statement Friday speaking further on this, saying:

“Interviews will resume today with the two people of interest and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as the victim, not a suspect. The investigation continues.”

Reports that Smollett might have orchestrated the attack came about on Thursday when ABC7 Chicago released a story citing “multiple sources” that the actor staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of Empire.

However, a representative for Smollett denied that he was being written off the TV show. Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement on the allegation too, saying, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The two people of interest who have been arrested in connection with Smollett’s attack are two Nigerian brothers. According to CBS News, the brothers apparently left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack. The men have worked with Smollett on Empire and have spent time with him in the gym. But the pair say they had no involvement with the attack. Initial reports of the incident said it was two white men who attacked the actor.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Gloria Schmidt, the attorney representing the brothers, said. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with. So they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” she added.

Schmidt said they could face charges as early as Friday but it’s unknown what they could be charged with.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett’s account.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men questioned by police know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

The Chicago Police have arrested the two men questioned in the attack on actor Jussie Smollett says The Los Angeles Times.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said in a statement to The Times.

“It’s unclear what the men could be charged with, however,” their attorney Gloria Schmidt, toldPage Six.

The arrests come on the heels of a 48 hour media rollercoaster ride which culminated in numerous conflicting reports regarding the attack on Smollett.

Rumors and bad reporting reached peak rumor mill last night when multiple outlets began claiming that the Chicago Police were ready to say the Smollett attack was a hoax pulled by Smollett and two friends because he was being written off of the hit FOX show Empire (which films in Chicago).

This led both FOX and the Chicago PD to issue very firm statements denying both rumors.

Tweeted Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi: “Media reports anout (sic) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Fox’s statement read: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

CBS Chicago reported that there was a police raid at the home of the two persons of interest being questioned by Chicago Police.

As we reported, investigators spoke to two persons of interest of Nigerian descent in connection with the January attack. There has been no further update on their involvement.

See original story below.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, Chicago authorities said Friday. Furthermore, Chicago police are once more disputing reports that circulated Thursday purporting that the attack was staged.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesperson Anthony Guglielimi told the Los Angeles Times Friday.

The two men, thus far only described as ""two Nigerian brothers,"" were first being questioned as potential persons of interest in the case. Now, they are being treated as possible suspects. The unidentified men were picked up Wednesday at the O'Hare International Airport and brought in for questioning. A search warrant was utilized on their property the following day. As of now, at least one of the men has been confirmed as having worked on Empire in some capacity. Previous reports suggested both men were extras on the series. At the time of this writing, the men had not been charged.

Per Guglielmi, investigators have found ""no evidence"" suggesting a hoax and clarified Friday that Smollett is cooperating in the investigation ""as a victim, not a suspect.""

Speaking with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America earlier this week, Smollett criticized those who were questioning his account. ""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,"" he said, later specifically remarking on criticism surrounding the alleged shouting of MAGA support during the attack.

The two men have been questioned by police since being picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after returning from Nigeria earlier this week.

Yesterday, police served a search warrant at the pair’s home.

Police sources are also reporting to the AP that at least one of the men DID work on Empire alongside Smollett — but it’s unclear in what capacity, or for how long.

That these two men are suspects now would be quite the development, considering the pair have been reported as being native Nigerians, despite Smollett’s initial claim that the two attackers were white.

Either way, it’s a major breakthrough for police, who have struggled for weeks to find security camera footage and other evidence of the attack.

No doubt new developments will keep coming today and the next few days. We’ll keep you posted…

The brothers, one of whom worked on Empire, were intercepted on Wednesday as they arrived back at Chicago’s O’Hare airport from Nigeria. Police have also confirmed that they searched the pair’s house on Thursday under a warrant.

Their arrest added a twist in the narrative of the reported attack on Smollett on 29 January. It came only a day after the actor and R&B singer had given his first detailed account to ABC News in which he said he had been set upon by two white assailants hurling racial and homophobic insults at him and slinging a noose around his neck.

In an emotional interview with Good Morning America, Smollett said his attackers had shouted “This is Maga country!” – a reference to Donald Trump’s mantra “Make America Great Again”. He also said he believed he was targeted because of his frequent political criticism of the president.

Two men were captured on surveillance camera in the vicinity of the reported assault on Smollett.

On Thursday, in a further twist, Guglielmi took the unusual step of publicly rebuffing speculation in the Chicago media that police were investigating whether the incident was in fact staged. In a tweet, he said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Smollett’s account of events has been challenged by doubters on social media who have questioned why he initially resisted handing over his cell phone to police and why later he gave them only a heavily redacted record of his calls around the time of the incident.

The actor defended himself on ABC News, saying he had been hesitant because he wanted to protect the privacy of his partner, family and fellow Empire cast members.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” he said."

ABC News(CHICAGO) — Two “persons of interest” in the alleged racial attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett will continue to be interrogated Friday, Chicago police said.

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” police added. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

The two “persons of interests” are being classified as potential suspects, police added.

“Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” police said.

This news comes after Chicago PD had confirmed Thursday that they identified and were questioning the two “persons of interest” in the alleged racial attack. One of those persons of interest has previously appeared on “Empire,” according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Police say they were tracking the two people and were aware of who they were “for a while,” and that investigators learned that the two individuals were returning to Chicago on Wednesday from Nigeria.

They are both cooperating and were questioned Thursday, police said.

The two persons of interest are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, they added.

Detectives also questioned Smollett Thursday, the official said.

Neither of the “persons of interest” have been charged with any crime related to the alleged attack, police said Thursday.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt, who is representing the two persons of interest, told Chicago CBS station WBBM that her clients were detained at O’Hare Airport Wednesday evening and were unaware of the attack on Smollett.

“When they first learned what happened to him, they were horrified,” Schmidt said. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that … They really don’t understand how [police] even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they’re not guilty of it.”

Late last month, Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s Empire, told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to police. Smollett said the attackers also yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said on Good Morning America that he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Prior to the police identifying and interviewing the two persons of interest, Smollett said he believes the two men in the photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him."

8:40 a.m.

Chicago police says local media reports that allege the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police “sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two “persons of interest” in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

The actor says two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Producers of the television drama also dispute that Smollett’s character is being written off the show, calling the reports “patently ridiculous.”

Two men characterized by police as ""persons of interest"" in the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett are now considered suspects and have been arrested on ""probable cause that they may have committed a crime,"" a Chicago police spokesman said Friday. Associated Press/May 20, 2016

Chicago police said Friday that they had arrested two ""potential suspects"" in the alleged assault against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

In a statement, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that ""detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

""We are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Guglielmi added.

Police have not identified the two men, who have not been charged.

Amid recent news reports that Smollett had staged his own attack in the city last month, Guglielmi reiterated in the statement that the actor ""is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

Chicago police have said they're investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. Smollett told police he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance, which he believes to be bleach, on him. According to Smollett, at least one assailant told him ""this is MAGA country"" during the attack.

The Associated Press reported that the two men, previously seen in a surveillance image released last month, were identified by police as Nigerian brothers who were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday. According to the AP, the police learned that at least one of the men worked on ""Empire.""

The police have not confirmed to The Washington Post whether the men have a direct connection with Smollett.

Two reports published Thursday evening questioned the veracity of Smollett's allegations. CBS Chicago -- citing an unnamed ""source with intimate knowledge of the investigation"" -- reported that investigators believe Smollett and two ""non-cooperating witnesses"" had staged the attack. ABC 7, meanwhile, published a report citing ""multiple sources"" who told the ABC affiliate that police were investigating whether the actor and the ""two persons of interest"" had ""staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off 'Empire.' ""

But in a tweet Thursday night, Guglielmi said the hoax reports were ""unconfirmed by case detectives."" He noted that police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who told ABC 7 earlier this month that Smollett ""had been cooperative"" in the investigation, had followed up with them ""to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment also responded to the reports in a strongly worded statement: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Several of Smollett's ""Empire"" colleagues, including co-creator Danny Strong, also denied the show had considered writing off the actor's character, Jamal Lyon, an openly gay R&B artist.

The hoax reports surfaced on the same day ""Good Morning America"" aired an interview with Smollett, who talked in detail for the first time about the alleged attack. Smollett appeared emotional as he spoke to ABC's Robin Roberts. He said he was angry about the attack and critics doubting his account.

""At first, it was like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of, like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

The actor said he believed some doubted his story because his attackers referenced President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett also said some media reports about his alleged assault were inaccurate. He said, for example, he never told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats. ""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

He explained some of the more scrutinized details of the case, including why he didn't change his clothes or remove the rope from his neck after the attack (""I wanted [the police] to see what this was,"" he told Roberts.) Smollett also explained his initial hesitation, referenced in the police report, to go to police.

""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,"" he said. ""And I'm not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.""

Smollett has established himself as an activist, working alongside organizations dedicated to HIV/AIDS awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy -- a background he referenced while addressing the skepticism surrounding his claims.

""I'm an advocate. I respect too much the people -- who I am now one of those people -- who have been attacked in any way,"" he told Roberts. ""You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.""

On Thursday, Jussie Smollett appeared on Good Morning America, noting that while he was “pissed off” at the attackers he claims targeted him with homophobic and racist slurs, he was equally upset at “the attacks” that followed, i.e. the swarm of doubters who didn’t quite think his story added up.



Advertisement

Admittedly, the news cycle around the reported attack has been quite the rollercoaster. There has been so much back-and-forth in regards to the persons of interest, their race, whether Smollett knew the attackers, the probability of an attack happening during the middle of a polar vortex in Chicago, whether a “MAGA” comment was ever uttered, the logistics around the location of the attack and its proximity to his apartment ... the list went on. And on.

Advertisement

The safest thing to do was to remain silent about it until actual suspects were confirmed or charges were handed out (professional reporting notwithstanding), as the entire narrative appeared to stand on shaky ground.

The most recent kerfuffle began when it was reported that the Chicago Police Department (CPD) were questioning the two persons of interest identified in the surveillance video from the night in question. Local independent station WGN-TV reported the two men taken in for interrogation were “of Nigerian descent and live in Chicago” and that one of them apparently worked as an extra on Empire.

Things spiraled out of control when reputable news sources such as ABC Chicago and Variety started providing broader coverage piggybacking off WGN’s take and adding their own pretty damning reports. The latter even included a “Jussie Smollett Attack Was Staged, Police Say” social media headline in its report it was later forced to delete when police deemed it inaccurate, clarifying that information was given by “sources.”

Then, there was this figurative nuclear bomb:

That was precisely the point when shit imploded. To add to the initial rumors that this whole thing was basically a Lee Daniels production far exceeding his dramatized television show on Fox, an extra whammy dropped when sources alleged the whole thing stemmed from Smollett’s character supposedly being written off.

A scandal! Where was Olivia Pope to fix this? Sheesh. To say it was a circus at this point would have been putting it mildly, to be honest.

Advertisement

Quickly after, however, it became apparent that Chicago Police had not, in fact, confirmed any reports of a staged hoax. The alleged “sources” were deemed “uninformed and inaccurate.”

Advertisement

Things got so out of hand that the Empire writers’ room and co-creator Danny Strong took to Twitter to refute the rumors. FOX even released an official statement debunking the hoax reports.

A whole hot ass mess. The lot of it.

Some people pointed out one glaring aspect: the rush to share details of the “hoax” was aided by clear MAGA supporters or otherwise ultra conservatives.

As I gawked in amazement at the clusterfuck I was witnessing on social media in real time, I noticed a few things and got to musing:

1. That desire to be “first” is real. And because social media has granted everyone a platform, this eagerness is no longer exclusive to breaking news reporters, and hasn’t been for a good while now. In the rush to provide commentary on what was a scandalous “reveal,” people may have not realized they were essentially siding with the very bigoted groups of people who don’t even want them to have basic human rights.

2. General and healthy skepticism aside, there’s something else occurring here that needs to be pointed out: there are clearly people who never believed Smollett from the very beginning. Now, this could be due to an array of things: It could be something personal against him, the disconnect between fighting for black men and fighting for gay rights (and the intersection smack dab in the middle), or simply being swept up in the shoddy reporting/rumor mill about the incident. Who’s to say?

But, there was a bizarre sense of ... joy around the whole thing that was very, very unsettling. It was a “gotcha” moment prevalent on social media, where people hop on the prime opportunity to unleash that they “never liked that nigga anyway.” Because, let’s face it, if this whole thing turned out to be a hoax, that would be supremely fucked up on another level. There’d be nothing funny about it, as the details of this reported incident aren’t isolated and speak to a larger issue.

3. The following dichotomy: You’re aware of the countless times Russian bots have crafted and implemented targeted campaigns to the detriment of black people, right? It was certainly easy to write off said fake news (real fake news, not the “fake news” dubbed by President Circus Peanut) in that case. When you use that same shaky news platform to then attack Smollett’s character, how does that exactly line up? And let’s say CPD did, in fact, legitimize the sources claiming the “staged” story. Since when do you immediately trust the words of the Chicago Police, when you’ve seen the corruption within their system at the expense of several black bodies? Does that change when that black body is black and gay? Or a celebrity on a show you don’t care for? Or for general tea and messiness? How do you reconcile with that?

I don’t know the answers to any of those questions, especially as the status of major aspects of this horrific ordeal is still outstanding. I just ... don’t know. And at this juncture, it’s okay. It’s okay to say that."

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two men whom police have identified only as Nigerian brothers were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire.” He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama. He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Friday’s announcement capped a furious 24 hours that has included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett continues to be treated by police as a victim and not a suspect.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi stressed that the two men have not been charged in the attack, only that they have been arrested for probable cause. He also said that police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.”

Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck."

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a email to Reuters.

The individuals are no longer being classified as suspects, the department said.

A spokesman for the department on Friday night declined to confirm to Reuters whether the individuals released were the two Nigerian brothers police said they arrested on Wednesday at Chicago O'Hare Airport in connection to the attack.

Authorities had previously said only that the pair, whose names have not been released, were persons of interest after they were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area where Smollett said two men shouted slurs at him and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

He has denied a media report on Thursday that said officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,"" Guglielmi said on Friday.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" caused uproar on social media, but some have doubted Smollett's account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at the airport on Wednesday after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told Chicago TV station CBS2.

Schmidt could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him."

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Guglielmi said at least one of the men worked on ""Empire,"" but he does not know in what capacity.

5am – A/B/C McCabe Says Justice Dept. Officials Had Discussions About Pushing Trump Out:

The former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe said the Justice Department discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump. (NY Times) – WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, said in an interview aired on Thursday that top Justice Department officials became so alarmed by President Trump’s decision in May 2017 to fire James B. Comey, the bureau’s director, that they discussed whether to recruit cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office. The dire concerns about the president’s actions also prompted Mr. McCabe to order the bureau’s team investigating Russia’s election interference to look into whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey. The F.B.I. also began examining whether Mr. Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests. Mr. McCabe’s explosive remarks were made in an interview with “60 Minutes” scheduled to air in full on Sunday. He was promoting his memoir, “The Threat: How the F.B.I. Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,” which will be released next week.

(Fox News) — The top Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees are calling for former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before their respective panels, following McCabe’s explosive claims in an interview this week that senior Justice Department officials had considered removing President Trump using the 25th Amendment. According to McCabe, Rosenstein offered to wear a wire to record the president, seemingly confirming reports last year. Rosenstein on Thursday again strongly denied that allegation, calling McCabe’s statements “factually incorrect.” House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga. , said in a letter to the committee’s chairman, Democratic New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, that the two top officials should be asked to testify — and subpoenaed if they refuse to comply. “Today, news broke confirming Americans’ worst fears about the highest-ranking leaders in the Department of Justice and the FBI,” Collins wrote. “In fact, we now know certain government officials plotted to investigate and undermine” the president.

In a string of morning tweets, Trump wrote that the “disgraced” McCabe “pretends to be a ‘poor little Angel’ when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax” and “a puppet for Leakin’ James Comey.” The president added that an internal watchdog report that was used to justify McCabe’s ouster was “devastating.” The report found that McCabe had a “lack of candor” with investigators looking into FBI leaks about its probe into the Clinton Foundation during the 2016 presidential race. “McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the president wrote.

Legal legend says alleged FBI-DOJ plot described by McCabe was ‘attempt at a coup d’etat’ // Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz on Thursday said the Department of Justice’s discussions to employ the 25th Amendment to oust President Trump– if true– amounted to an attempted coup. Dershowitz appeared on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” to give his take on former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s descriptions of Justice Department meetings where he said officials discussed ousting the president. “If [McCabe’s comments are] true, it is clearly an attempt at a coup d’état,” Dershowitz said.

5am – D Trump physician releases results of medical exam. (The Hill) —

The top White House doctor said Thursday that President Trump “remains in very good health overall,” even though his physical exam showed his weight is up from last year and he is taking a higher dosage of cholesterol medication. Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, physician to the president, on Thursday released more information about Trump’s exam conducted last week at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall,” Conley wrote in a memo summarizing the results. The president’s height was listed at 6 feet, 3 inches and his weight was 243 pounds, up from 239 pounds in Jan. 2018. Trump’s body mass index, a measure of body weight based on height, is 30.4, putting him in the category of obese. Trump’s total cholesterol was 196 mg/dL, down from 223 last year. But his daily dosage of the drug rosuvastatin was increased to 40 milligrams daily. Conley said there were “no findings of significance or changes to report on his physical exam, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, teeth/gums, heart, lungs, skin, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems.”

5am – E AMAZON vs NY:

Amazon cancels plans to open second headquarters in New York. (The Hill) – Amazon on Thursday announced that it has canceled plans to open its second headquarters, dubbed “HQ2,” in New York City following aggressive pushback from some local lawmakers and activists. “After much thought and deliberation, we’ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City,” the statement from Amazon said. New York lawmakers, including progressive superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), for months have been drumming up resistance to Amazon’s decision to bring half of its second headquarters to Queens. The activists and politicians have raised concerns that Amazon’s new headquarters would displace poor residents and raise rents. They have also sharply criticized New York City’s decision to offer $3 billion in state and city incentives to lure in Amazon. “We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion,” Amazon said in its statement, noting that it intends to continue growing the group of 5,000 employees already in New York City. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), however, had both hailed Amazon’s second headquarters as an economic boon to the city, claiming it would attract significant investments and other tech companies. “We are deeply grateful to Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, and their staffs, who so enthusiastically and graciously invited us to build in New York City and supported us during the process,” Amazon wrote. De Blasio issued a sharply worded statement after the announcement. “You have to be tough to make it in New York City. We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity,” his office said. Amazon had also aggravated New York politicians and union leaders when an executive at a City Council hearing said the company would not remain neutral if workers tried to unionize.



6am – A/B/C House passes border-security bill, sending it to Trump’s desk as WH prepares to declare national emergency. Hard-fought legislation that gives President Donald Trump 55 additional miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border — well short of what he requested — is on the way to his desk after a bipartisan House vote. The bill also closes a chapter by preventing a second government shutdown at midnight Friday and by providing $333 billion to finance several Cabinet agencies through September. Trump has indicated he’ll sign the measure though he is not happy with it, and for a few hours Thursday he was reportedly having second thoughts. The White House has announced Trump will declare a national emergency that would enable him to transfer funding from other accounts for additional miles of border fencing.

6am – D Signs You’re a Gen X Mom. (Themomelette.com) They call Generation X the “forgotten generation” because we find ourselves sandwiched between the behemoths known as Baby Boomers and Millennials. I disagree. We’re not forgotten, not at all. We just can’t be bothered to be upset by the fact that we’re bookended by two generations that seem quite happy to talk about themselves. No big deal — they do them, we do us. What we are is distinctive. We are the Cold War/MTV/latch key kid/big hair generation … our childhoods were spent doing fun and stupid things without the shackles of social media to eventually come back and bite us in the arse. We saw some stuff, you all … some really crazy stuff. And now we’re moms. We’re not Baby Boomer moms, who gave birth to Millennial moms. Oh, no, we’re Gen X moms who are raising Gen Z. And it is great when those two generations collide.

6am – E DC among nation’s worst for traffic. WASHINGTON (FOX 5 DC) – Every driver in the DMV will tell you the traffic here is bad – but a new study shows just how bad it is. Analytics company Inrix says D.C. is the second-most congested city in the U.S. The study says that D.C.-area drivers waste 155 hours a year sitting in traffic. That travel time costs each driver just over $2,000. This year, Boston took the top spot for most congestion. D.C. outpaces the nationwide average – where most Americans spend 97 hours a year in traffic.

House passes border-security bill, sending it to Trump’s desk as WH prepares to declare national emergency

Mark Krikorian @MarkSKrikorian 17h17 hours ago: Lots of bad but swallowable stuff in $ bill. But Sec.224 is a poison pill: Gives deportation immunity to any sponsor—or POTENTIAL sponsor—of an “unaccompanied” alien child. Creates incentive for illegals already here to order up kids from Central America (or anywhere). Outrageous

Center for Immigration Studies ‏@CIS_org As @JessicaV_CIS notes, there is a serious amnesty/sanctuary provision snuck into the spending bill.Section 224(a) would make it so ICE cannot detain or remove anyone who has effectively any kind of relationship (even just as a “potential sponsor”) with any unaccompanied minor

7am – B Reports of Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack being a hoax ‘unconfirmed by case detectives,’ Chicago police say. (Fox News) — Chicago police said Thursday evening that reports about the alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett being a hoax were “unconfirmed by case detectives.” Anthony Guglielmi, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department (CPD), tweeted that “media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.” He also wrote that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson “has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.” Guglielmi’s tweet followed a report on the matter from WLS-TV. The report came hours after Guglielmi tweeted that Chicago police detectives had identified persons of interest in the case. The individuals were not identified. “Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire,’” WLS-TV reported. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 while walking home to his apartment. He alleged the men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him.

7am – C Warning in Kansas Home Depot bathroom mistaken for bomb threat. WICHITA, Kan. (KEYE) – What some people thought was a bomb threat at a Home Depot store turned out to be a warning to others in the bathroom that things were about to get, well, smelly. KWCH reports that a 911 caller reported a bomb threat at the Wichita, Kansas store. “We just had a customer here made what may have been a bomb threat,” said the caller in audio released by Sedgwick County Communications. “He said, uh, somebody told me there’s a bomb in here and you need to leave the building. He said it three times.” Someone at the store told staff they overheard the threat in the restroom, and when police arrived to investigate, they found the “bomb threat” came from a man in a bathroom stall warning others about the severity of his need to use the restroom. The quote, according to KWCH, was “You all need to get out of here because I’m fixin’ to blow it up.”

MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MD LEADERS GEARING UP FOR 2020 CENSUS BY DOING OUTREACH TO IMMIGRANTS

Montgomery County Leaders Focus on Making the 2020 Census Count. County executive backs outreach efforts to make sure immigrants, senior citizens take part. (Bethesda Magazine) – Montgomery County officials are gearing up for the 2020 census, and they want to make sure immigrants and senior citizens are counted. Among other things, the census determines how state and federal funds are allocated and serves as a guide for determining the county’s social service needs over the next decade. The census also determines whether congressional seats will be reallocated among the 50 states, as well as if district lines must be redrawn. The U.S. Census Bureau places the responsibility of counting with “complete count committees” of community leaders who encourage residents to participate by mail or online. Data collection is done every 10 years and will begin April 1, 2020, and must be completed by Dec. 31, according federal law. Montgomery’s census committee is being chaired by County Council President Nancy Navarro, and has more than 40 members in subgroups that deal with the specialty areas of government, workforce development, faith communities, education, media, technology, community organizations and business. County Executive Marc Elrich and Navarro met with reporters Wednesday afternoon at the White Oak Community Recreation Center in Silver Spring, saying it is essential that local leaders ensure the county’s immigrant and senior citizen populations are counted. About one-third of the county’s population is foreign-born, according to the Census Bureau. Navarro said that the policies of the Trump administration could cause fear in undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being detained. Last year, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the introduction of a question on the 2020 census asking whether residents were American citizens. “We must acknowledge that there is a lot of tension and fear because of what has happened at the national level,” she said. Navarro added that the county’s senior population also was a focus for the census committee. “We have a lot of seniors living around the county who are not necessarily connected to a senior center, and we want to make sure that information is distributed throughout the county,” she said. Navarro said the census committee includes a number of members of the 2010 census committee. In the coming months, she said, the committee will be conducting outreach efforts such as a media campaign and a bus tour of the county. A legal battle is being waged in a number of federal courts over whether the citizenship question may be included in the census. Earlier this month, a ruling in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia declined to block the inclusion of the question, although a separate ruling by a New York federal judge in January found that the question was unconstitutional.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Guglielmi earlier also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

8:40 a.m.

Chicago police says local media reports that allege the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police “sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two “persons of interest” in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

The actor says two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Producers of the television drama also dispute that Smollett’s character is being written off the show, calling the reports “patently ridiculous.”

At the time, both had reported that police had arrested two Nigerian brothers as potential suspects in what might have been a hoax. That reporting was “inaccurate,” the police announced.

At least it was at the time. Now the two have been arrested, police say, based on probable cause of having committed a crime. However, neither have been charged in the attack — yet:

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects. Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not charged in the Jan. 29 attack. Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home. Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

Police are still speaking very cautiously about the investigation. They don’t want to use the word “hoax” yet, but they do note that they don’t have any video evidence of the attack either. The local CBS affiliate reports that police found some interesting items in a search of the brothers’ apartment:

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect. For clarification, the two individuals interviewed are classified as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated in an email Friday morning.

That’s quite an intriguing inventory from the search. Both the red hat and the black facemask fit Smollett’s description of the attack, as does the bleach. Needless to say, these are all also fairly mundane items in any household too. It certainly gets cold enough in Chicago to warrant a facemask hat, and bleach is a common item for laundry. The coincidence of finding all these still piques curiosity, as does the police interest in seizing “receipts” from the apartment.

The ABC affiliate reports that they’re hearing more explicitly that the two are being interrogated to determine whether Smollett concocted a hoax. At the moment, however, Smollett is still considered to be a victim:

Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.” A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday, but has since spoken with police.

For what it’s worth, though, the purported motive for a potential hoax appears to be ruled out. Fox denied rumors that Smollett was being written off “Empire,” a move which supposedly was the catalyst for an attempt at martyrdom:

The Fox network, which produces and airs “Empire,” issued a statement insisting that “the idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Hmmm. One could wonder whether Fox is trying to clear the air, or whether they’re trying to cover their own rear ends here.

At the moment, it’s impossible to conclude what — if anything — happened to Jussie Smollett. The arrest of the two brothers from the surveillance video and their connection to “Empire” certainly gives reason for skepticism about Smollett’s claims, but there’s no need to proceed beyond skepticism and jump to a particular conclusion one way or the other. The police seem very interested in getting to the bottom of this, and it’s best to wait until they do so. This is still a good reminder that extraordinary claims such as those made by Smollett require some extraordinary proof. That’s something that conclusion-jumpers should keep in mind the next time."

Two men arrested at a Chicago airport as suspects in the Jussie Smollett attack were released without being charged.

UPDATE (1:18pm PST): Jussie Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys as the investigation into his reported attack continues.

A spokesperson for Smollett confirmed to The Advocate that Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh are now the acting legal council for the actor. Both men's firms focus on high profile criminal defense cases. His team would not elaborate on why the actor has retained a criminal defense team.



His spokesperson also refuted reports that Michael Monico — the lawyer for President Donld Trump confidante Michael Cohen — is currently representing the actor.





***



The two men who were arrested and detained by Chicago police for probable cause in connection with the alleged hate-crime attack against actor Jussie Smollett have been released without being charged on Friday evening.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have addiontal investigative work to complete,"" spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi shared on Friday evening

Charges have not been filed against anyone for the January 29 attack and Smollett is still considered a victim in the incident.

The spokesperson confirmed prior reporting that at least one of the men worked on Empire. Representatives for Smollett told The Advocate late Thursday night that prosecutors had not relayed any information on the identity of the two men.

The two brothers' lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, has told outlets that the men know Smollett and would even attend a local gym with him. A source who frequents one of the gyms that the men visit confirmed to The Advocate that the men would openly discuss their connections with the show Empire that Smollett stars in.

The Advocate also confirmed that Smollett and the two men follow one another on their personal social media accounts as well.

Local outlets in Chicago released reporting on Thursday evening originally stating that Smollett worked with these two men to coordinate the attack; however, the Chicago police called these reports “unconfirmed.”

""Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" the department's spokesperson tweeted. ""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Original reports stated the men coorindated the attack with Smollett in response to him being written off Empire. Fox immediately denied this claim and issued a statement defending Smollett as news spread.

Widespread backlash has erupted stemming from that reporting as more details emerge across social media, leading to outlets like Variety to take down tweets using the original reporting. The local outlets have maintained their support behind this reporting.

Smollett told Good Morning America on Thursday morning that he stands by his story and was frustrated with criticism that he was lying. Rumors have circulated by mostly far-right groups on social media suggesting Smollett filed false reports."

One of the men currently being questioned as a potential suspect in the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett wasn't just an acquaintance of the ""Empire"" star, he was apparently a big fan of Smollett's music.

Days before the incident went down in Chicago, Abimbola ""Abel"" Osundairo shared a video of himself posing down to Smollett's hit song, ""Ha Ha (I Love You)."" Wearing only his underwear, Abel flexed and showed off his jacked physique.

The video was posted on January 9 in Chicago, 19 days before the incident went down with Smollett.

The 29-year-old man, originally from Nigeria, is a frequent competitor in the International Natural Bodybuilding Association, as well as a personal trainer. As we reported, Abel and his brother, Ola, are currently being interrogated by Chicago Police in connection with the alleged attack on Smollett.

The attorney for the Nigerian brothers says they know Smollett, and work out with him at their gym, but deny any involvement in the alleged attack.

When Ola and Abel's apartment was raided, cops found bleach and a script from the TV show, ""Empire."" Neither brother has been charged with a crime as of yet.

On January 29, Smollett was allegedly beaten by two men and a noose was put around his neck when he returned to Chicago to start work again on the Fox series Empire. He said that the attackers used racist and homophobic slurs.

Yesterday, Chicago’s ABC affiliate and TMZ reported that “multiple” unnamed sources in the Chicago PD told them that they are investigating whether Smollett and two men staged a racist and homophobic attack in order to keep Smollett’s job.

ABC reported that the home of two persons of interest was raided on Wednesday night. Both men are Nigerian nationals who worked as extras on Empire.

The two men were reportedly “picked up” in connection with the attack at O’Hare International Airport after returning from a trip to Nigeria. The men left Chicago the night Smollett was attacked.

Citing their unnamed sources, TMZ reported that they were the two men caught by a nearby surveillance camera on the night of the attack.

ABC reported that their unnamed sources told them that Smollett was being written off Empire, and that he staged the attack to boost his national profile.

But a spokesperson for the Chicago PD said that there is “no evidence” to support the reports and that the unnamed sources were “uninformed and inaccurate.”

“Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement that Smollett is considered the victim in the attack.

Chicago PD has also said that no one has been arrested in the attack so far, and that the investigation is still open.

In a statement, Twentieth Century Fox Television said that it’s “patently ridiculous” that Smollett was being written out of Empire.

“The idea that Jussie Smollet has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the statement said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett himself spoke out in an interview on Good Morning America earlier this week about previous rumors that he faked the attack. Those rumors cited his refusal to give his phone to investigators.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry, but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said.

“Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

Instead, he turned over redacted phone records, which the Chicago PD said could not be used in the investigation.

“I have to acknowledge the lies and the hate,” Smollett said on Good Morning America.

“And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more.”

“And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”"

According to reports, the two men who were captured on surveillance footage the night of the Streeterville attack were met by police at O’Hare Airport on Wednesday night and brought in for questioning. They have been described as “persons of interest” not suspects, but Smollett told GMA that he was certain the men in the tape were the ones who attacked him on January 29.

Although Jussie Smollett has maintained that the men who shouted “This is MAGA country” and tied a noose around his neck during the attack were white, the two “persons of interest” are Black brothers from Nigeria who have reportedly worked as extras on EMPIRE and spent time with Smollett at the gym.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney representing those two men in the case, told CBS 2 in Chicago her clients have been in custody at Area Central detective headquarters since Wednesday night.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” she said.

Police deny reports that Jussie Smollett attack was staged over his character being written off of ‘EMPIRE’

Shortly after reports surfaced that police were questioning two persons of interest in the case, multiple reports claimed police believe the racist and homophobic attack against the actor was staged because his EMPIRE character was being written off the show.

Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman denied the reports on Twitter.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he wrote. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

On Thursday, Rob Elgas of ABC 7 in Chicago reported that “multiple sources” alleged Jussie Smollett and staged the incident because his character was being written off of the FOX series, EMPIRE. Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, wrote about a source who said investigators believed the “non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.”

FOX denied the notion that Smollett’s character was being written off of the show and continues to stand behind the actor.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network said in a statement on Thursday. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

“He’s been very cooperative and very consistent,” Smollett’s publicist, Pamela Sharp, said of the “ridiculous rumors.”"

It’s unclear what the men, identified as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, could be charged with, however, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Ms Schmidt told the network. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on January 29 in Chicago — in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Ms Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beat down.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show.

But the reports were disputed by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The brothers had left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack, according to CBS News. They were detained by police after arriving on Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.

Police raided their home in the Windy City, removing bleach, a “black face mask hat,” a red hat, an Empire script, receipts and other items.

Critics have cast doubt on Smollett’s account — though the 36-year-old actor and singer has insisted he’s been consistent and truthful during the investigation.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said in his first interview since the attack. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”"

This is the latest in a series of fake news events propagandized by a mainstream media and Congress in an attempt to corrode the unity of the American people.

Smollett allegedly fabricated his story involving a rope around his neck, a Subway sandwich and a bottle of bleach after his “assailants” allegedly screamed, “this is MAGA country” followed by a barrage of racist insults.

Now, ABC7 reports that Smollett’s monstrosity of lies may have bitten him like a rabid bald eagle.

The two men suspected of the crime have been apprehended and one of them is possibly a fellow actor from Fox’s show Empire.

It’s unclear what the men, identified as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, could be charged with, however, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Ms Schmidt told the network. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

Jussie Smollett speaks out

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on January 29 in Chicago — in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Ms Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beat down.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show.

Chicago – Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

The two men detained, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire,” Guglielmi said earlier. He said he did not know what the man’s job was.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett, 36, has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. He said police also are contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

Word began to spread that Chicago police were reportedly investigating claims that the Empire actor worked with the two men currently being questioned as persons of interest. CBS Chicago’s Brad Edwards revealed a source told him that ""indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event"" and police “believe the non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.”

Meanwhile, ABC7 in Chicago’s Rob Elgas reported that “multiple sources” say police are looking into the possibility that “Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of Empire.”

A rep for the Chicago PD released a statement detailing how any theories of Smollett's participation in the attack are ""unconfirmed. It read: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

And Fox was quick to shut down the misinformation. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” a rep from Fox Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and the producers of Empire said in a statement.

This new development comes less than one day after Smollett spoke with Good Morning American in his first sit-down interview since the assault. He detailed what happened that early morning, how the two men beat him, why he believes it's a hate crime, and finally spoke out against doubters who believe he's lying.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” the 36-year-old actor said. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett said the rumors of him lying are ""ridiculous.”

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he added. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The latest update from the CPD reads:

CHICAGO -- The Latest on the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett (all times local):

9:25 p.m.

Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.""

Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck.

___

2:05 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman confirms that the two suspects arrested in the reported hate crime involving black actor Jussie Smollett are black.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also says the suspects were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. He says department policy prohibits him from naming the victim but says that he can say the two Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case involving the ""'Empire' cast member."" Smollett is an actor on the television drama and has said he was beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack last month.

Guglielmi also says at least one of the men in custody worked on ""Empire,"" but he does not know in what capacity.

The men are being interrogated Friday by detectives. Police picked them up Wednesday at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after they flew from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their Chicago apartment.

___

9:55 a.m.

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not been charged in the Jan. 29 attack.

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on ""Empire,"" but he does not know in what capacity.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

8:40 a.m.

Chicago police says local media reports that allege the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police ""sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two ""persons of interest"" in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

The actor says two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Producers of the television drama also dispute that Smollett's character is being written off the show, calling the reports ""patently ridiculous.""

Effectively proving that the liberal media reports about them were smears and lies, all three broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) and principal Spanish-language networks (Telemundo and Univision) omitted the findings from their evening reports.

Just before the 3:00 p.m. hour of CNN Newsroom began, host Brooke Baldwin came back from a commercial break with the news that was “just in.” “The students involved in that high profile encounter while attending last month’s March for Life rally in Washington have been exonerated,” she declared as if they were accused and on trial for an actual crime.

She added: “The Diocese of Covington says an independent investigation found that the students at Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky did not instigate that incident.”

A poorly timed cough made it seem as though Baldwin could barely bring herself to speak the truth about the Covington Kids: “Investigators also concluded that the students did not chant ‘build the wall’ and never – [cough] excuse me – never responded to the Black Hebrew Israelites with racist or offensive statements.” Ironic.

SIGN THE PETITION: We Support the Covington Kids, Quit Attacking Pro-Life Teens

As if to suggest it was a grain of salt against the investigation, Baldwin noted that “[i]nvestigators say they didn’t speak with the young man at the center of the whole thing,” as if Nick Sandmann was some kind of ringleader. But she did admit that investigators could not get a hold of serial liar Nathan Philips for questioning.

At about the same time the evening network programs were on the air, PBS NewsHour and anchor Judy Woodruff shared some of the investigation’s findings with viewers:

An investigation has found that no evidence that Catholic school students used racist or offensive language in an incident at the Lincoln Memorial. The encounter last month involved teenagers from a school in Covington, Kentucky, and Native American activists. Videos of it quickly went viral. The investigation was done for the Catholic Diocese of Covington.

Instead of reporting on the Covington Kids being vindicated, ABC’s World News Tonight gave more airtime to Empire star Jussie Smollett despite the continued absence of evidence he was assaulted. Unironically, NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt boasted about being in Washington, D.C. to promote fact-checking at Woodrow Wilson High School. NBC also touted the results of the Westminster Dog Show.

Here's how the case has unfolded:

What happened

They said that in the early morning of January 29 he was attacked by two people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" and ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim"" in the Streeterville neighborhood where he had been staying while filming his hit TV show ""Empire.""

Smollett took himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he and a friend spoke with CNN's Don Lemon and confirmed the incident had happened.

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has portrayed the gay character of Jamal, a successful singer in the musical Lyon family on his show.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment offered their support after the reported attack.

""We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our 'Empire' family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night,"" a representative of 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN. ""We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate -- and especially against one of our own.""

Hollywood and fans rallied

""Empire"" creator Lee Daniels posted his support on his official Instagram account.

""We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front,"" Daniels said in a video. ""And no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you.""

More details start to emerge

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN that authorities had video of Smollett entering the Loews Chicago after the alleged attack with what appeared to be a noose around his neck.

According to Guglielmi, Smollett told detectives that during his walk back from Subway sandwiches he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of the Loews.

The actor told police the two men yelled ""'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er"" while striking him, before putting a noose around his neck and pouring an unknown substance on him.

Police were called 30 to 40 minutes after the attack, Guglielmi said.

Investigators said they had the rope and Smollett's sweater in their custody and were testing for the unknown substance on them.

We also learned that Smollett and his manager Brandon Moore said they were speaking on the phone at the time of the attack.

'Persons of interest'

Soon after Smollett filed his report, Chicago police found two ""persons of interest"" on video that they believed were the likely offenders. Police started searching the area of the alleged attack for cameras and witnesses. Chicago Police Detective Commander Edward Wodnicki said police interviewed more than 100 people. Wodnicki said they also found approximately 35 police cameras and over 20 private sector cameras in the area.

Video from those cameras led to a solid timeline of events, Wodnicki said.

The video showed each of the two men getting into a cab and then a rideshare. Eventually, Chicago police determined that they had gone to Chicago O'Hare International Airport and had taken a flight to Nigeria, purchasing a roundtrip ticket with a return date of February 13.

As police waited for the brothers to return, they continued their investigation, obtaining more than 50 search warrants and subpoenas for phone and social media records.

The men were taken into custody when they returned to the United States on February 13 as they came through airport customs. Once in custody, the two brothers both asked for an attorney. After speaking with the men, their attorney told police ""something smelled fishy"" and that she didn't think the brothers were the offenders as had been reported.

Smollett's family responds

Smollett is the member of a large family that includes several siblings who are also in the entertainment industry.

The family released a statement standing with the ""Empire"" actor and thanking everyone for their support after what they called an act of ""domestic terrorism.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,"" the statement said, ""His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. ""

The letter

Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi told CNN that a letter containing a white powder was received on January 22 at Cinespace Studios in Chicago, where ""Empire"" is filmed.""

The prompted a response from the hazardous materials unit, he said.

Guglielmi said authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, but he declined to give details on the content of the letter and said the FBI was leading the investigation into it.

A spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Entertainment, which produces the series, declined to comment when reached by CNN.

Possible witness?

A neighbor who lives in Smollett's apartment building told police she saw a ""suspicious man"" who had what appeared to be a rope outside the building, Guglielmi told CNN.

The unidentified neighbor also told police she saw another man in the vicinity of the building.

Detectives met with the woman and took her statement, Guglielmi said.

Smollett breaks his silence

In a written statement first published by Essence magazine, Smollett said ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger.""

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett wrote. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""

'I can't let attackers win'

Smollett performed his first concert since the reported attack at West Hollywood's Troubadour club on February 3 and tearfully talked to the audience about what happened.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all, I couldn't let those (expletives) ... win,"" he said. ""Above all, I fought ... (expletive) back.""

He also clarified his injuries, saying he was bruised but his ribs were neither cracked nor broken.

Hesitant to report the incident

The report included details such as Smollett's descriptions of the alleged attackers' clothing and mentioned details previously released by authorities, including what the alleged attackers said to Smollett.

Smollett's first TV interview

""Good Morning America"" aired its interview with Smollett talking to Robin Roberts.

Smollett told Roberts one of the attackers said, ""'This MAGA country, n****r' and he punched me in the face so I punched his a** back.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

He also said he respected victims of hate crimes too much to lie about what happened.

The star theorized that he had been targeted because of his vocal criticism against Donald Trump and his administration, telling Roberts, ""I come really hard against 45.""

'Empire' connection

One of the two men investigators questioned as persons of interest appeared on Smollett's series, according to police.

Guglielmi had said earlier on Twitter that ""the people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time.""

The two men are Nigerian brothers -- identified as Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- and were questioned by police after flying into Chicago-O'Hare International Airport from Nigeria, Guglielmi said.

Police said they searched the men's apartment earlier.

Two men arrested

On February 13, police took the two persons of interest into custody .

Early in the day on February 15, Chicago police said the two brothers were being treated as ""potential suspects"" and that detectives had ""probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.""

Police did not say what the men were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

Later that same day, the men were released without charge ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations,"" Guglielmi said . ""And detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

Upon release, the men were classified as witnesses instead of persons of interest.

Smollett denies he orchestrated the attack

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN. They stated that Smollett was angry about the latest developments, which included two police sources telling CNN that Chicago police believe the actor paid the brothers to orchestrate the assault on him.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett's attorneys said they expect further updates from Chicago police on the investigation and will continue cooperating with authorities.

Brothers push back on their portrayal

In a joint statement issued Monday to WBBM - TV, the men said: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Supporters decide to wait and see

As new information emerged, some of Smollett's initial supporters adopted a wait-and-see stance.

""The information is still coming out,"" Sen. Cory Booker said. ""I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources.""

Booker, who is running for president, was one of several Democrats to weigh in on initial reports of the attack.

Director Ava DuVernay also weighed in.

""Despite the inconsistencies, I can't blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility?"" DuVernay wrote in a tweet. ""That one? I'll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Grand Jury scheduled

The Osundairo brothers went before a grand jury, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.

At one point, Smollett's attorneys asked that the grand jury proceeding be postponed so he could provide new details, but ""essentially they gave us no new information,"" Cmdr. Edward Wodnicki said.

The proceeding went on as scheduled. The grand jury heard the evidence, police said, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office approved a felony disorderly conduct charge against the actor.

Prosecutor opts out

The county's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation, according to a spokeswoman from her office.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" the spokeswoman, Tandra Simonton, said.

Named a suspect

Smollett was ""officially classified"" as a suspect in a criminal investigation for allegedly filling a false police report, according to Chicago police.

A Cook County grand jury was hearing evidence in the case, the police spokesman said.

Arrest and bail hearing

On February 21, Smollett was arrested on suspicion of filing a false police report. Under Illinois law, filing a false police report is a Class 4 felony, punishable by one to three years in prison. A judge set his bond at $100,000 and ordered that the actor surrender his passport.

Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett staged the alleged attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

Smollett first ""attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language,"" an apparent reference to a letter sent to the ""Empire"" set in the days before the attack.

""When that didn't work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process,"" Johnson said. ""And why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked.""

Johnson said Smollett "" took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Smollett's work on 'Empire'

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment expressed their continued support for Smollett.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" the statement read.

But hours after the arrest of Smollett, the network said they were considering their options.

""We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement to CNN. ""We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""

Producers later cut Smollett's character from the final two episodes of ""Empire's"" current season.

The decision, producers said, was made to ""avoid further disruption on set.""

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" the statement said. ""Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

Indictment

Mark Geragos, one of Smollett's attorneys and a CNN legal analyst at the time, said the actor maintained his innocence.

The attorney called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,"" Geragos said.

'Not guilty'

On March 14, Smollett pleaded not guilty in to accusations that he staged a hate crime and filed a false police report.

The actor was arraigned before Judge Steven Gregory Watkins, and his attorney entered the formal not guilty plea on his behalf. Watkins agreed to allow Smollett to travel to California and New York to meet with his lawyers and set his next hearing for April 17.

Charges dropped

In a dramatic reversal, prosecutors drop all the charges against Smollett.

The move marks a major shift in a case in which Chicago police alleged last month that the actor hired two acquaintances to attack him in late January to promote his career.

The Cook County State's Attorney's Office didn't immediately explain why the felony disorderly charges were dropped, except to say it came after reviewing the case's facts, and in view of his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond.

""I have been truthful and consistent on every level since day one,"" Smollet told reporters in a Chicago courthouse on Tuesday. ""I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of.""

Smollett called himself a ""man of faith"" and said he wanted to move on with his life.

""I want to thank my family, my friends, the incredible people of Chicago and all over the country and the world who have prayed for me, who have supported me."""

9:55 a.m.

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not charged in the Jan. 29 attack.

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

UPDATE: Men arrested in Smollet attack released from custody, no charges filed

The two men, ages 25 and 27, were still being questioned by detectives and had not been formally charged as of Friday evening, department spokesman Tom Ahern said.

Earlier in the day, Anthony Guglielmi, another police spokesman, said: “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime, and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Detectives believe the men, both of whom are black, are the same people shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, Guglielmi has said. The men allegedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs during the incident, which had been investigated as a possible hate crime police have said.

The men’s identities have not been released.

But a law enforcement source said the men are brothers and at least one of them has worked on the show “Empire.” They are reportedly Nigerian and had traveled to Nigeria the day of the attack before returning Wednesday, when they were arrested at O’Hare Airport, a source said.

2011 arrest for attempted murder

Court records show that one was charged with attempted murder in a 2011 stabbing that occurred in the 4200 block of North Ashland. That is less than a block from the home that police raided Wednesday night and recovered personal effects, including cell phones, a source said.

The one brother reached a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to aggravated battery; he was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $674 fine. His attorney in that case did not respond to interview requests.

Another attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, has told reporters the men knew Smollett.

“The have worked with him on ‘Empire,'” she told CBS2. “… They’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

The Chicago Sun-Times reported Thursday that police are investigating the possibility the reported Jan. 29 attack was staged. However, on Friday, Guglielmi again stressed “there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

“The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he said of Smollett.

Smollett has told police that he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him, yelled the slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck.

The actor initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, Guglielmi previously said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

The actor said he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. His manager has said he could hear the attack over the phone and was able to hear the phrase “MAGA country” — the acronym from President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Detectives allegedly traced the location of the men arrested through ride-hailing and taxi records from the area where Smollett said the attack happened, according to a law enforcement source. Police have video from a doorbell camera, among other images of the men.

Both played football

Both men, who are two of five siblings, previously played college football. At least one of them went to high school near the home police raided, according to the college website.

Court records show both men filed for bankruptcy in September 2016 and owed more than $120,000 in student loans.

At the time, neither man reported having a full-time job. Their monthly incomes, they said, were $160 and $142, which they earned from various odd jobs.

The two also started a party and decoration business in 2015 that they operated out of a South Side building owned by their parents, records show. Their parents did not respond to phone calls Friday.

The business was “operating at a loss” at the time of the filing and was dissolved in May 2018, court and state business records show.

One of the two men showed an interest in investing. He reported that he owned four shares of a pharmaceutical company, one share of Berkshire Hathaway and one share of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company. He valued the shares at $300 at the time, though a single share of Berkshire Hathaway was worth more than $200,000 at the time of the bankruptcy filing.

In 2017, one of the men co-founded a home remodeling company. In his bio on the company’s website, he says he has three degrees, including a master’s degree in business and a bachelor’s degree in management. The other company co-founder could not be reached Friday.

‘Good human beings’

A trainer at the brothers’ North Side gym said the men have been among the most polite gym guests in the two years he’s known them.

“They’ve never shown anything other than being good human beings,” the trainer said.

The trainer — who asked to only be identified by his first name, Danny — said the aspiring actors are former bodyguards, and one is an amateur boxer.

It’s unclear what the men, identified as Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, could be charged with, however, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Ms Schmidt told the network. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on January 29 in Chicago — in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Ms Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2am beat down.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show.

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied Smollett’s character was going anywhere.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” it said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The brothers had left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack, according to CBS News. They were detained by police after arriving on Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.

Police raided their home in the Windy City, removing bleach, a “black face mask hat,” a red hat, an Empire script, receipts and other items.

Critics have cast doubt on Smollett’s account — though the 36-year-old actor and singer has insisted he’s been consistent and truthful during the investigation.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said in his first interview since the attack. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”"

A Chicago police spokesman confirms that the two suspects arrested in the reported hate crime involving black actor Jussie Smollett are black.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also says the suspects were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. He says department policy prohibits him from naming the victim but says that he can say the two Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case involving the ”‘Empire’ cast member.” Smollett is an actor on the television drama and has said he was beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack last month.

Guglielmi also says at least one of the men in custody worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

My favorite thing about Don Shirley didn't get much screen time in that movie Green Book, or maybe it did sometime after my pal and I walked out of the theater because we had seen enough of the old gag about how white people and black people are different and ain't that just the weirdest thing. Besides, it wasn't like the movie was about Shirley anyway, so we bailed about an hour in and chalked up the 20 bucks each and tossed the butter-slicked popcorn to some kid walking into some other, better flick. And even if we'd stayed, I don't think the movie would have gotten to my favorite thing about Shirley, which is not that he once sat in the back of a car, driven through the American South by someone white; not that he had endured racism and carried on with a measured calm.

My favorite thing about Shirley is that he once gave up his career as a pianist in the early 1950s, after being a child prodigy. Shirley gave his first public piano performance at the age of three and was invited to study music theory in Leningrad when he was nine. In the mid-1940s, Shirley spent his teenage years performing his compositions with the Boston Pops and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. But by the start of the '50s, Shirley came to the realization that there might be a lack of upward mobility for black musicians with a deep investment in classical music, so he went off to study psychology at the University of Chicago, and then worked in that city as a psychologist.

Several major social forces collided in America in the 1950s. The United States population started to expand, slowly at first and then by great bounds thanks to the Baby Boom. On top of this, amid rising incomes (especially for middle-class white Americans), there were also revolutions in the domestic technology they could buy with their new money. The portable radio became a staple of the decade; televisions became more numerous and prominent in homes. As people's access to entertainment grew, entertainment, as well, grew and changed. Anyone with access to a radio or television could consume all manner of media at the touch of a button: not only news, but also stories of crime, details of murder and theft, romance, comedy. Where the radio had once been primarily a vehicle for music, it now served multiple purposes. Between these technological developments and the sheer number of young people in the country, an organic generational gap emerged. Young people were taking in more information than had ever been available before, and it was suspected of influencing their behavior in ways that the older generation couldn't understand.

This concern over the influence of media on young people grew into a national panic over juvenile crime, which picked up in the 1950s and became the blueprint for law enforcement's tough-on-crime stance that we still live under today. The logic was that young people were hearing and watching stories that painted criminals as ""cool,"" and so they were, naturally, moved to carry out acts of crime themselves. Like most panics, the concerns themselves were rooted in a conviction that things were worse than they actually were, and that they were bound to get even worse. What will we do if young people continue to watch these stories and read these books? How will we survive it all?

This led to a different type of approach, rooted in studies of human behavior in hopes of preventing youth crime. Shirley had been out of music entirely for a few years but had been interested in finding his way back. In the early 1950s, he received a grant from researchers interested in studying the relationship between music and juvenile behavior, looking for a link that might present an opportunity to cut the growing problem short. Shirley took up residence in small clubs, planting teenagers in the audience but otherwise playing to a crowd of people unaware of the experiment he had been tasked with.

Shirley would play with sounds, measuring the responses of young people to the different combinations and compositions he put together. The audiences had no idea of the science behind what he was doing, but they were awed by his unique ear, his desire to take compositional risk, and the way he strung sounds together—as if each note were traveling the air in search of a sonic companion.

It was in this way that Shirley fell in love with music again. In 1955, he released his first album. Tonal Expressions, on Cadence records. It was a stunningly inventive album of compositions, even though it didn't make Shirley the international star he maybe deserved to be.

My favorite thing about Shirley is that he found his way to the piano as a curious child, and never stopped letting curiosity inform his passion for the instrument. In a time of national panic about young people listening to and watching the wrong things, he set out to see if he could stem the tide of crime by playing his instrument in a small room with young people watching. It wouldn't necessarily make for a good movie because there wouldn't be a conclusion at the end of it all. Crime kept on happening, and Shirley went on to make records at a torrential pace for the next decade. But the mere idea of the experiment relied on a special type of musician, one who was willing to attempt the unknown, and be comfortable walking away with a problem unsolved.

I love that story about Shirley because it is the story that most reminds me of the fact that he never had to play music. He would have been fine without it. How fortunate, I suppose, that there was such a panic over juvenile crime.

Americans love to declare of things distinctly American that they are not American at all. You get what I mean, or if you don't, wait until the next time someone commits a hate crime or shouts out something racist or otherwise bigoted during a television interview or a press scrum. Through the predictable cycles of frustration or outright rage or ironic tweets, there is inevitably a line of rhetoric lamenting ""America's original sin"" with some boilerplate language about unity and choosing love over hate. These messages are often punctuated with a version of the sentiment: This is not who America is.

The actor Jussie Smollett was assaulted by two men in Chicago last month. Per his account, the men called Smollett racist and homophobic slurs before throwing a noose around his neck. Lee Daniels—producer and director of Empire, the show Smollett stars in—posted a tearful, passionate video in support of Smollett. In the video, Daniels is outside and lit by the last moments of sunlight as he balances anger with concern and compassion. At the end of his video, Daniels insists: ""America is better than this.""

America, of course, is not better than this. When a nation is built on a foundation of violence, it takes an unnatural amount of work to undo every last lineage of harm and then honor the harmed parties with anything resembling equity. Some of the first steps in that direction almost certainly rely on an honest assessment of the history, and of the ways that history has generational effects.

To insist that violence and bigotry aren't American is to continue feeding into the machinery of falsehoods that allow this country to keep making the same mistakes. There are people who talk about Martin Luther King Jr. as if he lived a long and healthy life and then chose to peacefully die at the end of it. The very concept of ""choosing love"" is an expression of privilege, as though there were only two options: love and hate, as Radio Raheem had emblazoned across his knuckles in gold during Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. But the very concept resting at the heart of Do the Right Thing is that all this love ain't created equal. The love I have to give is malleable, but it has limits. All of our love has its limits, and it should. I choose to love my people, and their people. And sometimes I might also choose love with your people. But other times, I choose whatever keeps me safe, and that isn't necessarily hate, but it might be if it gives me a comfortable enough distance.

And since we are talking about movies, after all, the whole thing I'm kicking around here is how movies have been so relentless in their quest to sanitize race relations in America, it has almost become its own genre entirely. Period pieces, usually. Some story about a time when violent racism was permeating every corner of a community, except for the one corner where a black person and a white person learned to get along by toppling the odds and seeing the common humanity in each other after being forced to share proximity because of work or love or some beneficent accident. These movies don't really work to deconstruct ideologies of racial superiority, or examine how a country arrived where we are today. They're films that start a few inches away from a perceived finish line, and then spend two hours slowly crawling across before throwing up hands while roses rain down from the sky.

The Negro Motorist Green Book was published and updated for a stretch of 30 years, from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow. It was initially created by Victor Hugo Green, a mailman who traveled often for his job and saw as more and more black people gained access to automobiles and began wanting to explore the vastness of the country—to chase down their version of an American Dream. For black people in America during Jim Crow, traveling meant the possibility of being denied service while on the road. Many black people who were new to traveling great distances had no guide for the rest of the country, and how they might find themselves treated in its various corners. At best, there could be an embarrassing interaction at a restaurant or gas station; at worst, there could be a hostile or violent reaction to their presence.

The Green Book started out as a small, green-colored handbook and expanded as the years went on. It was a travel guide that listed all the places where its black readers and travelers could feel safe: which diners, guest homes, museums, hotels, grocery stores would cater to them anywhere along the road, in every direction. The book spanned 300 cities in the U.S. and Canada, and relied on its readers to provide information on the various conditions wherever they traveled. It was an analog, user-created database, which circulated quietly among black homes for its entire run. At that time, there were no established interstate freeway systems in the country, and motorists had to rely on long, winding roads to get to their destinations. The Green Book was vital, alerting travelers to what towns and cities might welcome their presence, and what towns and cities they might want to be more cautious in or avoid altogether.

Of the many things America loves to pat itself on the back about, one of the things is our obsession with exploration. The Green Book is fascinating as a not-so-distant relic because it affirms that the myth of American exploration was never available or safe for all Americans.

I once found an old Green Book in an antiques store in upstate New York. It was tucked on a shelf next to old caricatures of black maids and old magazine ads with people in blackface pushing toothpaste. I was, it seemed, in the ""black history"" portion of the antique store. The version I found was from 1952, and, by that point, the book felt somewhat like a magazine. It had advertisements for products like skin lotion and car wax. It had promotional materials for scenic tours to enjoy while on the road. It seemed to be catering to a very specific type of American black person, one who had found a bit of financial freedom during the boom of the post-war economy and the technologies it introduced. It felt like the black people reading this book maybe believed that, if they worked hard enough, they could get the America they knew they deserved.

Of course, that made my handling of the Green Book all the more bittersweet. This book, bursting with ads, promised you the chance to invest in America like anyone else. It was filled with pictures of black travelers, grinning with enthusiasm and the rush of possibility. But even with all this optimism, one cannot ignore the grim, central function of the book, still explicitly present in many of its pages: offering routes for safe travels for black people in a country that could swallow them whole at any moment.

The movie Green Book isn't necessarily about The Negro Motorist Green Book at all, unless one imagines Shirley's white driver, Tony Lip, as a type of Green Book of his own, shepherding the musician through the South, fighting when he's needed, and generally presenting a barrier between Shirley and the racism of the world. This seems to be the general idea that the film tries to sell—that anyone who stands between black people and harm is essentially doing the same work as Victor Hugo Green's book.

But that isn't it. In real life, The Green Book was about a communal passing of information to shepherd people to safety through autonomy—not about the intercession of a savior in the life of a single black person. The Green Book sometimes expressed hollow hope, but also operated from the fundamental understanding that no one could really save the black people reading it from the hatred they'd encounter on the road.

Even with all of the shine and gloss added to The Negro Motorist Green Book in its later years, it was still a book that served this single function. Black people have been making ways for other black people to arrive someplace safely for as long as there have been black people in America, I suppose. I stop at a gas station in one of the last cities on the outskirts of a small Ohio town, and the black dude behind the cash register asks me where I'm going, how long I'm going to be there; nods slowly and tells me what routes to take and where not to stop, even if it seems like I have to. I'm often thinking about this while driving through unfamiliar parts of the country—how I rely on the kindness of black people who know the terrain and who have, perhaps, suffered on that terrain for years before they run into me. Sometimes the warning is a knowing look, shared as I exit the restroom someone is entering, or as we lock eyes in the potato chip aisle of a gas station. The physical, hard copy of The Green Book was needed less urgently, it seemed, as civil rights laws went into effect and highway systems began to develop. But the actual, living problems that The Green Book addressed don't ever vanish, not as long as there are still places in America where black people are less safe. The work of The Green Book continues, among black Americans who understand where they're from and are careful to alert others what those places are and aren't capable of accepting. Some small towns rely on black people to do their most public-facing labor: cashiers and front desk attendants and clerks of all sorts. The new version of The Green Book is a conversational network that echoes from one person to the next, until a clearer, kinder path of road is carved out.

And the need for this type of network may never change. Funny, to see a movie bearing the name of an iconic text that helped black people realize their own dreams of safe travel and American exploration. Funnier, I think, that such a movie exists in a time when black people still must exercise ingenuity to make safer pathways through remote parts of the country. Green Book is the type of movie that allows people in America to think about all the gentle ways racism can be waved away, and, for that, it is adored. Shirley died in 2013, but his family spoke out against the movie's release, and against the acclaim it's continuing to receive. They've taken issue with the movie's story overall, and in particular with its representation of Shirley and Lip's relationship. Shirley had viewed Lip as an employee, his family said—someone tasked with driving him around, and not much more. Of course, the family's resistance to the movie didn't stop the plaudits from rolling in. The black relatives of Shirley had to make room for the coronation of the film's white creators—one of whom is Nick Vallelonga, Lip's son.

That's just the way it goes, I guess. The easy part plays well. The people who loved The Green Book got to feel good about their America for a little while, and with enough of those good feelings strung together, it might be easy to forget that there ever was a fire, that the fire, in fact, is still burning.

My favorite thing about Shirley is not that he was a genius who led a sometimes-spectacular life. It is that, in the moments in between, he likely led a life that was very normal. And that is spectacular too.

What I want is a movie cast entirely of the unspectacular but still happily living black geniuses, who have pointed me on a safer path out of the goodness of their own hearts. Perhaps scenes in whatever clothes they wear after they take off their Sunday best. I want them to be absolved, but no one else. I don't want anyone to watch this movie and consider themselves clean. Everyone else will have to earn it.

CBS 2 investigative journalist Brad Edwards, citing a source with intimate knowledge of the Chicago Police Department’s investigation into the matter, reports the alleged attack on Smollett was “potentially orchestrated” by the actor and the two men, who are persons of interest in the case. A spokesperson for the Chicago police told Edwards that CBS 2’s report and others are “unconfirmed” at this time.

The “persons of interest” are brothers of Nigerian descent who worked on Empire and are in police custody, being questioned about their connection to the attack. A lawyer for the brothers told CBS 2 that the pair could be charged on Friday. “They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m.,” Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, said. “They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then.”

CBS 2 reports:

As they were picked up by police at O’Hare, officers were at their home, taking several items and leaving behind an inventory list of some of the items taken. The list includes a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” Schmidt continued.

Schmidt confirmed to CBS 2 that the brothers were extras on Empire and occasionally worked out with Smollett.

“They are really baffled why they are people of interest,” the lawyer said. “They really don’t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they are not guilty of it.”

On Thursday, Chicago police Anthony Guglielmi said detectives were questioning the two individuals, but said neither of them were “considered suspects at this time.”

The men were spotted on surveillance cameras in the Chicago neighborhood where the alleged assault occurred, according to Guglielmi.

The developments come as law enforcement continues to investigate the case, which began with Smollett telling police two masked individuals spewed racist and homophobic slurs at him and doused him with an unknown chemical substance on January 29. The 36-year-old also told police the alleged assailants placed a thin rope around his neck and yelled “This is MAGA country” before fleeing the scene.

Appearing on ABC’s Good Morning America Thursday, Smollett claimed his attackers were motivated by his public criticism of against President Donald Trump and his policies. “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he told interviewer Robin Roberts.

Chicago police said Monday they were unable to criminally investigate the matter after Smollett turned over phone records that were redacted. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” said police. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Smollett and members of his family have maintained the actor has been honest about the alleged incident through the investigation, claiming his story has been the same throughout the investigation. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to ESSENCE magazine. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”"

The reports surfaced late Thursday as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett (all times local):

9:25 p.m.

Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.”

Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck.

___

2:05 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman confirms that the two suspects arrested in the reported hate crime involving black actor Jussie Smollett are black.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also says the suspects were arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. He says department policy prohibits him from naming the victim but says that he can say the two Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case involving the “‘Empire’ cast member.” Smollett is an actor on the television drama and has said he was beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack last month.

Guglielmi also says at least one of the men in custody worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

The men are being interrogated Friday by detectives. Police picked them up Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after they flew from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their Chicago apartment.

___

9:55 a.m.

Chicago Police say the two men being questioned in the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are considered suspects.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said Friday that the men are in custody and have been arrested based on probable cause that they may have been involved in a crime. But he says they have not been charged in the Jan. 29 attack.

Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers. Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.

Guglielmi says at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” but he does not know in what capacity.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men are the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

___

8:40 a.m.

Chicago police says local media reports that allege the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support the reporting. Guglielmi says Johnson said the supposed police “sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as investigators questioned two “persons of interest” in the case who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett says he was attacked.

The actor says two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Producers of the television drama also dispute that Smollett’s character is being written off the show, calling the reports “patently ridiculous.”

The Chicago Police Department is pushing back rumors and even false news reports that claimed the racism and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett was staged.

The department initially released a report last month saying that Smollett was beaten by two men, who poured an unknown substance on him and then placed a noose around this neck. He was later treated for injuries at a local hospital.

Since then, certain media outlets, using information from unnamed sources, have reported that Smollett staged the attack with two men because his character was being written off Empire.

According to the Chicago Police Department that is false. They directly contacted at least one media outlet referring to the incident as a “hoax” to correct the record, and even issued a statement to clarify the situation.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” read statement from the department obtained by ESSENCE.

The statement added that the department has “no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Fox

Smollett is one of the main characters on Fox’s hit hip-hop musical drama, Empire. The show’s studio and network have issued a joint statement denying that they are any plans to write him off.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” their statement obtained by ESSENCE read. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

A spokesperson for Smollett referred to suggestions that the actor and singer would stage an attack as “ridiculous rumors.”

“He’s been very cooperative and very consistent,” the rep added.

Michael Rowe

Police spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, which remains open. The persons are believed to have been the same individuals seen on surveillance images taken in the area on the night Smollett was attacked.

In an interview on Good Morning America, which aired earlier this week, Smollett said he believes that the two men captured by the cameras are his attackers.

“For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘O.K., we’re getting somewhere,” he stated to anchor Robin Roberts. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”"

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

The pair are ""under arrest and being questioned as suspects but have not been charged,"" police said.

Two brothers affiliated with ""Empire"" were picked up for questioning as they arrived at O'Hare International Airport Wednesday evening, according to authorities. At the time, they were classified as ""persons of interest.""

Police did not elaborate on the brothers' roles on the show.

The Chicago Police Department threw cold water on reports Thursday night that Smollett staged his own attack in response to his character being written off of the show.

""Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted. ""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

A CBS reporter also tweeted the theory, citing ""top sources.""

A statement from 20th Century Fox Television, which produces ""Empire,"" denied that Smollett was being taken off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,"" it reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Police first said they identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the case Thursday morning.

""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case,"" police said in a statement.

The development came on the same morning Smollett's first television interview since the alleged attack aired.

“We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" a spokesperson for Smollett said in a statement.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett's account to detectives included that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m. as the actor returned home from an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, according to the police report.

Smollett said in the interview that he was left in shock after the incident and inititally didnt want to report it to police.

""I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck,"" he said. ""So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me... I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett said he's ""pissed off"" not just by the attack itself but by those questioning his story.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f-----, they called me a n------. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

The Chicago police report lists the weapon in the alleged attack as ""hand, feet, teeth, etc.""

""He is a victim,"" Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson recently said of Smollett. ""And we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative.""

Hours of surveillance video from multiple cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack happened were reviewed, but police have said no footage of an attack has been found.

Smollett handed over redacted phone records to Chicago police Monday, but authorities said the records ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limted and heavily redacted.""

A representative for Smollett said the redacted records were to protect the privacy of his contacts.

""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""

Only one image has been released of possible ""persons of interest."" It remained unclear if the two in the photo are the men currently being questioned.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" Smollett said in the interview. ""Never did."""

10:30 AM PT — Both Abel and Ola have been placed under arrest, but have not yet been charged with a crime.

One of the two men currently being detained for questioning in the alleged attack of Jussie Smollett was not only an extra on ""Empire,"" he snapped a photo with the co-creator himself.



Twitter

Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo are the two brothers from Nigeria, currently in custody with the Chicago Police Department. Nicknamed Ola and Abel, the two brothers have also retained an attorney who has said she does not know what her clients could possibly be charged with.

Gloria Schmidt has revealed that the two brothers know Smollett from work on ""Empire,"" and worked out with him at their gym, but deny any involvement in the alleged attack on the actor.

Ola also dabbles as a rapper, and has released music on his Sound Cloud page under the name King Ola with tracks like, ""Gang Bang.""

According to the Chicago PD, the two men are being viewed ""as potential suspects. Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.""



Instagram

Smollett does indeed appear to know them and even follows Abel on Instagram. Ola also posted a photo of himself and Lee Daniels from 2015 when the jacked actor appeared on the FOX show.

Abel has also appeared on TV, including a small part on ""Chicago P.D.""

Chicago reporter Charlie De Mar obtained the results of a search warrant executed at the apartment of the two brothers, and among the things listed include bleach and a red hat. As we reported, Jussie claims the attackers threw bleach on him while shouting homophobic and racist slurs.

Also recovered during the search was a copy of a script from ""Empire."" Ola and Abel have not yet been charged with a crime, and although reports have surfaced that Smollett may have been involved with staging the attack, cops doubled down Friday morning that there is no evidence to suggest the incident was a hoax."

Chicago police released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Two men characterized by police as ""persons of interest"" in the attack against Smollett are now considered suspects and have been arrested on ""probable cause that they may have committed a crime,"" a Chicago police spokesman said Friday, Feb. 15, 2019.

Chicago police released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation.

The reports surfaced late Thursday as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

NEW YORK - Chicago police contested media reports on Thursday that officers were investigating whether _Empire _actor Jussie Smollett staged being physically assaulted because he was being written out of the television show.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama Empire, told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on 29 January.

In an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of _Empire _released a statement saying: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago police are questioning two “persons of interest” who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on Empire and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

“They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. “They are baffled why they are persons of interest.”

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

“They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi said on Twitter."

Red State‘s Sarah Lee wrote yesterday that the case of the alleged hate crime Smollett said happened to him in the early morning hours of January 29th in Chicago is starting to fall apart. One of the alleged “attackers”, it was reported, was an extra on the “Empire” set.

But in a new development, the Chicago PD say a possible motivation for the openly gay actor to stage a fake hate crime was because his job might have been on the chopping block:

Chicago police confirmed Thursday that detectives are talking to two persons of interest in connection with the alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.” A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday, but has since spoken with police.

His reps and Fox dispute that report:

Smollett’s representatives said he is not being written off “Empire.” Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement saying, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The writers of Empire have never planned or even discussed writing @JussieSmollett off of the show. — Empire Writers (@EmpireWriters) February 15, 2019

Though his reps, Fox, and the “Empire” writers are denying he was being written off the show, that says nothing about what Smollett might have believed about his future with the popular series.

He told Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts in an interview yesterday he believed critics of his story were motivated by race:

“If I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.”

If breaking news reports coming out of Chicago about this case are accurate, the only potential racial angle of significance in this story is that the two “persons of interest” seen in the screen captures released by the police are Nigerian:

Neighbors said they believe the men, who are Nigerian, are brothers who grew up in that apartment, and have lived there for years. Neighbors described them as friendly and possibly body builders, and said they have long wanted to be actors.

Reason‘s Robby Soave breaks down what this all means:

But the fact that the two men evidently knew Smollet—a detail confirmed by their attorney—certainly makes inside job a more plausible explanation than random hate crime. At the very least, it seems vanishingly unlikely that the perpetrators were white Trump voters.

Yep. And don’t forget, too, the threatening letter containing white powder that was sent to Smollett at Cinespace Studios just days before the alleged attack. Was that staged as well?

If it’s ultimately confirmed this was a hate crime hoax, a whole lot of people who defended Smollett are going owe apologies, like 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and many others.

Fox 32‘s Rafer Weigel provides an update this morning on where things stand:

#CPD on #JussieSmollett: Interviews will resume today w/ 2 POI & their attorney. While we haven't found video documenting alleged attack, there is also no evidence 2 say that this is a hoax. Alleged victim is being cooperative & continues 2 be treated as the victim, not a suspect — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 15, 2019

On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that would make lynching a federal crime.

Advertisement

The bill, which was introduced in June by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), had previously passed in the Senate in December, but did not pass in the GOP-majority House before the end of the 115th Congress. The Hill reports that the bill passed Thursday with a voice vote.

While discussing the bill, Booker cited the recent reported attack in Chicago against actor Jussie Smollett of Empire fame and said that “lynching is not a relic of the past.”

“Justice for the victims of lynching has been too long denied, and as we look forward we must collectively in this body make a strong, unequivocal statement,” he added.

Harris called lynching a part of the country’s “uncomfortable history” that she said has never been “truly acknowledged” or “reconciled.”

“We must confront hate in our country. ... We are now making clear there will be serious, swift and severe consequences,” Harris said.

According to the text of the bill (pdf), “the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction.” Lynching was a “widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century ” th at “occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.”

Advertisement

Between 1882 and 1968, at least 4,742 primarily black people were lynched, and 99 percent of all perpetrators went unpunished.

The bill also notes that there have been roughly 200 attempts to pass anti-lynching legislation in Congress since 1918, and between 1890 and 1952, seven U.S. presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching.

“Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so,” the bill reads.

On June 13, 2005, the Senate passed a resolution to apologize to victims of lynching and their descendants “for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation.”

Advertisement

The bill deems “it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime.”

The bill will now move to the House for approval."

“There is one side that is right, and there is one side that is wrong,” Page told arts writer Alexandra Pollard. “Gay marriage... It’s not a debate.

According to the media house, the brothers have identified as “persons of interest” in the alleged hate attack on Jussie Smollett, and they could face criminal charges on Friday, their attorney Gloria Schmidt told CBS News.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt told the network. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She further added that the Nigerian brothers, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show “Empire” and worked out with him at the gym. However, she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on Jan. 29 in Chicago – in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2 a.m. beatdown. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

The brothers had left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack, according to CBS News., but were detained by police after arriving Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. The police raided their home in the Windy City, removing bleach, a “black facemask hat,” a red hat, an “Empire” script, receipts and other items.

However, some sources have told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS on Thursday that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being written off the Fox show. Although, this claim was shut down by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, who said, “Media reports about [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Also, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied Smollett’s character in “Empire” was about to be written off. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” it said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The reports surfaced late Thursday as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

CHICAGO -- Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

7. Brilliant politicians in New York cost themselves 25,000 jobs and untold billions of dollars; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) cheers

— Amazon will not be bringing their second headquarters to New York after outrage over the three billion dollars in economic incentives cause the economically illiterate in the city to believe the city was losing money on the deal. Ocasio-Cortez is ecstatic her district will not receive the jobs, tax dollars or infrastructure this deal would have eventually brought.

6. Remington has failed to meet its employment goals and now must repay some of their incentives

— The deal to bring Remington to North Alabama may officially be a bust at this point. They suffered bankruptcy and only hired about a quarter of the people initially promised. Now, the company has repaid some of the incentives totaling more about one million dollars to Morgan County, Limestone County, Madison County and the city of Athens.

5. Another social justice warrior hoax has been exposed — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is suspected to have made up his attack narrative

— According to reports out of Chicago, the police knew Jussie Smollett was not telling the truth from the beginning of this ordeal where the actor said he was attacked by two white Trump supporters for being liberal and gay. It is believed Smollett and the two “persons of interest” perpetrated this hoax because Smollett was about to be written out of the television show.

4. The Alabama Democratic Party has its leadership elections voided; They must redo them within 90 days

— The Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) credentials committee has essentially voided the State Democratic Executive Committee (SDEC) leadership elections, meaning they must hold new elections for the top two spots within 90 days. This means very little to most people, but the power struggle in the Alabama Democratic Party is one of many reasons Democrats have almost no power in the state. This decision also forces the state party to change their bylaws, which will limit the ability to party boss Joe Reed to stack the deck. Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) called the last elections “a total sham.”

3. The city of Birmingham is still trying to get at their monument to Conferedate soldiers

— Attorneys for the city have asked a judge to keep in place a ruling that would allow Birmingham to remove a Confederate monument, even though the city has not said it will remove the monument while the legal case is ongoing. Another judge ruled last month, 20 minutes before his term ended, that state law barring the modification and removal of these monuments was unconstitutional because it violates the free speech rights of local communities.

2. Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks (R-Huntsville) urged the president to use his veto and have the military to build the wall

— In a fruitless effort to get the president to not sign the latest deal to keep the government open, Brooks said the compromise was a failure by Congress and that “the massive 1,169 page spending bill is a debt junkies’ dream.” Brooks said he will vote no because the bill forces him “to choose between two really bad choices: vote to shut down the government or vote to aid and abet the killing of at least 50 Americans per day who die from illegal alien homicides or from overdoses on poisonous drugs shipped through our porous southern border.”

1. President Donald Trump is set to sign a bipartisan agreement to keep the government open and build some of the wall, also plans an emergency declaration

— The U.S. Senate voted 82-16, with both Alabama senators voting in the affirmative, and all Alabama House Republicans except Martha Roby voted “no” on the compromise to keep the government open and give the president some money for his desires to beef-up border security. Now, to the chagrin of Democrats and shock to Republicans, the president is prepared to make an emergency declaration that he will use to build walls and expand security with monies allocated to other measures. The president will sign the bill and the emergency declaration after the U.S. House votes today."

After what appeared to be a brutal, racially motivated hate crime, the reaction among fans was one of shock and disgust.

Today, many are experiencing those same feelings - but for a very different reason - following an equally shocking report.

Police suspect that Smollett staged the attack, and this isn't just a run of the mill conspiracy theory originating on 4Chan.

Real evidence is beginning to mount suggesting that the incident actually may have been some sort of bizarre PR stunt.

Many questions remain about why Smollett would go to such bizarre extremes and, if he did, just how he pulled it off.

CHICAGO (AP) — The investigation into black actor Jussie Smollett’s account of being beaten in a racist, anti-gay attack took another turn Friday when Chicago police said two men arrested in the case are also black.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the two were arrested for “probable cause” of committing assault and battery on the “‘Empire’ cast member” but had not been charged as of Friday afternoon. Smollett, who is gay, has said two masked men beat him after shouting racial and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

The two suspects — whom police previously had identified only as Nigerian brothers — were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday and taken into custody after returning from Nigeria after police learned that at least one of the men worked on “Empire,” according to Guglielmi. He said he did not know what the man’s job was on the television drama.

He confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Chicago apartment where the men lived but did not have any information about what exactly what police found.

Guglielmi’s comments followed a furious 24 hours that included local media reports that the attack was a hoax. Police say those reports are unconfirmed. Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Guglielmi reiterated Friday that there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday that the men police took into custody on Wednesday were the ones who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw an undetermined chemical substance and looped a rope around his neck before running off. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi said police have not found any surveillance video showing the attack itself, though they continue to look for such evidence. He says police also are contacting various retail stores in the hopes of determining who bought the length of rope that was around Smolllett’s neck.

The singer and actor said that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett told ABC News that earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director Frank Gatson called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation .

Two Nigerian brothers are now considered “potential suspects” in the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett, Chicago police said Friday morning as detectives continued to grill the men.

Cops said they have “probable cause” that the pair may have been involved in the Jan. 29 attack, in which the “Empire” star claims he was punched and called racist and gay slurs by two men who shouted “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett also said an unknown “chemical substance,” possibly bleach, was tossed on him and a noose was thrown around his neck.

The two Nigerian men were initially identified by police Thursday as “persons of interest.” They had been taken into custody Wednesday after arriving at O’Hare International Airport from their native country and are currently being interviewed with their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, present, police said.

Earlier, Schmidt said her clients could face criminal charges, but it’s unclear for what.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt told CBS News on Friday. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

She said the men, who have not been identified, worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show “Empire” and worked out with him at the gym.

But she insisted her clients had nothing to do with the alleged assault on Jan. 29 in Chicago — in which Smollett claims two men shouted racist and gay slurs at him, punched him, doused him with a “chemical substance” that could’ve been bleach and threw a noose around his neck.

Schmidt said the brothers were just as stunned as everyone else over the 2 a.m. beatdown.

“This is someone that they know, this is someone that they’ve worked with,” she said. “So they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Sources told the Chicago affiliates for both ABC and CBS on Thursday that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being written off the Fox show.

But the reports were disputed by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“Media reports anout [sic] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied Smollett’s character was going anywhere.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” it said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The brothers had left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack, according to CBS News. They were detained by police after arriving Wednesday at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.

Police raided their home in the Windy City, removing bleach, a “black facemask hat,” a red hat, an “Empire” script, receipts and other items.

Critics have cast doubt on Smollett’s account — though the 36-year-old actor and singer has insisted he’s been consistent and truthful during the investigation.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said in his first interview since the attack. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”"

On Thursday , a ABC7 Chicago report citing “multiple sources ” said that Empire star Jussie Smollett may have orchestrated his own attack in order to avoid having his character written off. But a lmost immediately following its publication , Chicago police and writers for Empire denied the validity of those reports.

Smollett was beaten by two men on January 29 by men reportedly yelling homophobic and racial slurs. Afterward, police sought two men who were caught on grainy surveillance video nearby. On February 14, ABC7 reported that Smollett failed to appear for a follow-up interview with police, and that the homes of two men who appeared as extras on Empire had been searched. CBS2 Chicago reported that investigators “took bleach, shoes, electronics, receipts and other items from the home” of the men, who left for Nigeria the day of the attack and were picked up at O’Hare International airport upon their return . Gloria Schmidt, a n attorney for the men, told CBS that her clients deny having anything to do with the attack:

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” Schmidt said. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

A representative for Smollett countered that he did answer police questions on Thursday and that he “continues to be cooperative.” And a communications officer for the Chicago Police Department answered the reports with a tweet saying that there is “no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Writers for Empire also tweeted that there are no plans for writing Smollett off the show:

Fox, the network that airs Empire, also stood behind Smollett, according to Variety:

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett himself addressed those insisting he was responsible for his own assault on Good Morning America the morning before ABC7 called the attack a hoax. “ It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”"

One of the men interviewed by police in connection with an attack on Jussie Smollett has appeared on 'Empire'. The 36-year-old actor was subjected to a ""possible hate crime"" last month when two assailants allegedly hurled homophobic abuse before punching him, pouring an unknown chemical substance over him and putting a rope around his neck, and Chicago Police revealed on Thursday, February 14, they had questioned two brothers over the alleged incident. Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Times newspaper the two are currently not considered suspects but confirmed their homes had been searched earlier in the week. He did not know which role the man had played on the Fox TV show. Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the two men, claimed they were ""baffled"" as to why they had been brought into the investigation.

She told CBS Chicago: ""They do know Jussie. They have worked with him on 'Empire'.

""My preliminary investigations show that on set it's very tight. They're all very cordial with each other, so they're baffled why they are people of interest.""

Meanwhile, Jussie opened up about the attack on 'Good Morning America' on Thursday, February 14, and admitted it had all happened ""so fast"" while he was out getting food but he didn't realise he had a noose around his neck or had a substance, possibly bleach, poured on him until afterwards.

He told Robin Roberts: ""I went to the Subway, got my order.

""During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia... I said, 'Call me when you can.' He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, 'Empire!' And I don't answer to Empire, my name ain't Empire.

""And I didn't answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ""f***ing 'Empire' n****r.' So I turned around and I said, 'What the f**k did you just say to me?' And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, 'This MAGA country, n****r,' and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his ass back and then we started tussling

""There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.

""It happened so fast. It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.""

Jussie also expressed his fury that people have dismissed his account as a hoax.

He said: ""It became a thing of like, 'Oh, It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

The 'Alien: Covenant' actor admitted he didn't immediately call police because he didn't want to be thought of as ""weak"".

He said: ""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as [LGBTQ] people, are not weak.""

The pair were picked up by police at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday as they arrived back in America after visiting family in Nigeria to be questioned over the January 29 attack involving the star.

It came as Smollett faced allegations that he had staged the attack because he was being written out of Empire, the popular Fox show on which he appears.

The two brothers were arrested on suspicion of battery but, as of Friday afternoon, they had not been charged.

Police can now hold them for an additional 24 hours without charge if the prosecutor's office agrees, or must file charges by 5.45pm on Friday.

Ola appeared on Empire in 2015 and both brothers have had minor roles on Chicago PD.

Smollett follows their joint Instagram account and, according to their lawyer, sometimes goes to the gym with them. DailyMail.com has identified photographs of one of the brothers inside the gym in Smollett's apartment building in June last year. The gym is private to residents of the luxury condominium building.

They have denied any involvement in the attack and say they were horrified to hear o of it with the rest of the world when it grabbed headlines last month.

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were the two people in custody. DailyMail.com can confirm that those people are Abel and Ola Osundairo

Police sources said on Thursday night that they were pursuing the theory that Smollett orchestrated the hoax because he was being written out of the show and wanted to drum up publicity to save his role - a claim that has been strenuously denied by the show and uncorroborated by the police department.

In his reports to police, Smollett says he was attacked by two assailants whose facial features he could not make out but that it was a racist, homophobic ambush during which they called him 'Empire f****t n****r' and shouted: 'This is MAGA country!'

The brothers' names are also included on a list of evidence that was left at their home after Chicago PD officers ransacked it on Thursday and the pair are listed in public records as the tenants of that house.

'The two individuals interviewed are classfied (sic) as potential suspects.

'Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,' Anthony Guglielmi, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, said in a statement.

Before returning to the US on Wednesday, they shared photographs and videos on Instagram of their time in Nigeria.

Neither has been charged and Chicago Police Department has until 5.45pm on Friday to charge or release them.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt spoke out on Thursday to say they were 'baffled' by the allegations against them and that they are innocent.

'They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m.

Ola appeared on the second season of Empire as an extra. He is shown with Lee Daniels, the show's creator, on set in 2015

The brothers' names are included in this inventory list that police left with their relatives detailing all the items they took from the house as part of their investigation. The list included proof of residency for both brothers and bottles of LA's Totally Awesome bleach

Smollett follows the brothers' joint Instagram account where they post videos and photographs of themselves working out

The two brothers were in Nigeria at the start of the month. They flew there hours after the Smollett attack on January 29 and returned on Wednesday

'They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then,' Gloria Schmidt, the pair's lawyer, told CBS Chicago on Thursday night.

'When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified.

Smollett wept in his first interview about the attack that was aired on Good Morning America on Thursday and said he was heartbroken that his story had been questioned

'This is someone they know.

'This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.

'They are really baffled why they are people of interest.

'They really don’t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime, but they are not guilty of it,' she said.

TMZ reported that detectives found the men by looking at ride-sharing history records from the night of the attack.

Smollett, 36, says he was attacked by two men on January 29 as he walked home from a Subway at 2am.

He has since said he believes he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of President Trump and that he would have had more public support if he had said his attackers were 'black, Muslim or Mexican'.

Among items police seized from the home were black ski masks. It is not known if they were the same as those shown above which the brothers sell online. Smollett said one of his attackers was wearing a ski mask when he was attacked

In a June 2018 Instagram video, one of the brothers is seen walking on his hands on a treadmill inside the private gym in Smollett's luxury apartment building

While Chicago PD will not confirm on the record that the two men being questioned are the two black actors, they did tell DailyMail.com on Thursday that they are the men who were seen in surveillance camera footage walking near the area of the attack at around the same time.

Smollett said on Thursday that he had 'no doubt' the people in the video were who punched him, tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

He said the attack, which only lasted around 30 seconds, included them saying: 'This is MAGA country!' and calling him 'Empire f****t n****r'.

On Thursday, the show issued a statement to deny that Jussie was being written out of the show.

'The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous.

'He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,' it said.

Chicago police also would not confirm that it was a hoax.

'Interviews will resume today with the two people of interest and their attorney.

'While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack.

This is the home in Chicago where the brothers live with their relatives. It was raided on Wednesday night

Chicago PD broke the door to the brothers' family home when they raided it on Wednesday and terrified their relatives inside

This was the scene after the police had 'searched' the family's home. Their relatives say they were asked about how the men knew Smollett

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

'There is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as the victim, not a suspect.

'The investigation continues,' Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago PD spokesman, said on Friday.

In a tweet on Thursday, he slammed ABC Chicago for reporting unconfirmed source claims.

'Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted ABC Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,' he added.

Police seized a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items from the home where the brothers live.

The relative, who was home when the raid happened on Wednesday night, described hearing loud banging on the door before police flooded into the home and announced that they had a search warrant.

The woman, who is in her 20s, told CBS Chicago she was 'so scared' and thought she was going to die. She said she was patted down by an officer and asked by detectives if she knew Smollett.

She said that she thinks the brothers are being question because of their loose Empire connection to Smollett and the fact that they left for Nigeria on the same day of the attack.

In his hour-long interview with Good Morning America that was aired in part on Thursday, Smollett, wearing a collection of badges to show his support of Freedom and Pride among other causes, revealed his frustration at some of the public disbelief surrounding his version of events.

The actor wept as he said 'who the f*** would make that up' when addressing the skepticism surrounding his version of events

He said he does not think he would have been met with the same cynicism if his attackers weren't Trump supporters and revealed his belief that he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of the president.

Smollett also went into detail about why he did not immediately hand over his phone to the police to verify parts of his story and said he was trying to protect private photographs, videos, songs and phone numbers of high profile people and his partner.

He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: 'There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.'

Describing the chain of events once police arrived at his apartment at the request of 60-year-old Frank Gatson, his friend who was at the apartment when the attack took place.

'I told them what happened. I asked them to turn their body cameras off. I was like, ""Please just come in.

'I don't want a big scene with my neighbors,""' he said, adding that he had left the rope around his neck and his bleach-doused clothes on for them to see.

He said that while he left the rope around his neck, it was not 'wrapped' tightly.

After the police had come into his apartment, he took them down to where the attack happened to walk them through it and became excited when he noticed a camera overlooking the exact spot where it took place.

Last week, police discovered a Chilli Habanero hot sauce bottle which seemed to contain bleach (above). It was found near where Smollett says he was attacked and had bleach poured on him . It was found 10 days after the attack

A week before the attack, Smollett received this threatening letter at the Fox studio where he works

'I looked up and saw there was a camera, directly on the post on the intersection.

Smollett is pictured in the hospital after a friend called the police to report him being attacked. He did not want to involve authorities

'Then the detective told me that the camera was facing north so they didn't have it and that was disappointing.'

Later, he added how desperate he was for them to find footage of the attack.

'I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons.

'Number one, I want them to find the people that did it.

'Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ""alleged"" attack.

'Number three, I want them to see that I fought back,' he continued, welling-up.

'I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,' I didn't,' he said.

He was overcome with emotion when presented with the prospect that his attackers might not be found.

'Let's just hope that they are found.

'Let's not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said,""I just hope they find them."" And she said, ""Sweetie, they're not going to find them.""

“I don’t know what transpired, but he’s obviously not playing,” Polian said.

A couple notes after talking to Bill Polian about AAF:

1) CEO Charlie Ebersol reached out to Colin Kaepernick about interest in playing in the league. “I don’t know what transpired, but he’s obviously not playing,” Polian said. Polian personally spoke to Tim Tebow, who declined. — Lindsay Jones (@bylindsayhjones) February 14, 2019

Playing in the league usually means players earn upwards of $225,000 over three years, something Kaepernick obviously thought he could pass on given that on his own he’s making so much more.

Kaepernick Karma

Kaepernick knows his staying power, but a store owner had to learn the hard way how valuable the NFL star really is.

—Police deny reports that Jussie Smollett attack was staged over his character being written off of ‘EMPIRE’—

A Colorado Springs, Col., athletic wear store that took a stand against Colin Kaepernick and stopped selling Nike gear to protest of the athlete’s activism over police brutality, now can’t afford to keep its doors open and is going out of business, the New York Daily News reports.

On Monday Stephen Martin, owner of Prime Time Sports announced on Facebook:

“PRIME TIME SPORTS is closing. All merchandise 40% OFF. Thank You for 21 mostly good years.For everybody that has offered help and support through the “Honor The Flag” memorial wall and NIKE boycott, now is your time to help me liquidate. Please do your Facebook thing with everyone you know so this can go as quickly as possible.”

Folks better recognize that Kap is the man of the hour with financial power!"

Recall that Smollett claimed in late January that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and allegedly shouting “MAGA country.” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931, but OK.

The dubious description of the alleged attack provided to local authorities led the left to assume the perpetrators were racist white men who of course represent all of President Donald Trump’s nearly 63 million supporters. Except the actual facts seem to show something else.

On Thursday local Chicago authorities raided the home of two “persons of interests,” both of them Nigerian brothers. At the home authorities found “a black face mask hat, an ‘Empire’ script, a phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach,” according to Los Angeles station KCAL.

“Empire” is an ongoing Fox series that stars Smollett. According to the two men’s attorney, Gloria Schmidt, they know the actor and have worked with him on the series.

Listen:

“They do know Jussie. They have worked with him on ‘Empire.’ My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest,” she said to the station.

Perhaps they wouldn’t be as baffled if they examined the facts. The two were reportedly arrested while arriving back into the U.S. at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport.

“They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m. They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then,” their attorney admitted.

Nothing suspicious about that, right? Except according to a relative who lives at their home with them, the two left had left for Nigeria the exact same day that Smollett was attacked.

Hmm …

The two were identified Friday morning by the Daily Mail as actors and gym rats Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. Smollett reportedly follows their Instagram account:

What remains unclear is why on Earth they’d attack their colleague. Some speculation has arisen that perhaps Smollett and the two men had staged the attack.

“Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire,'” Chicago station WLS reported late Thursday evening.

A reporter with Chicago station WBBM claimed the same thing:

However, shortly after these claims began circulating, the Chicago Police Department’s chief communications officer, Anthony Guglielmi, seemingly dismissed them as false.

“Media reports anout (sic) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Fox issued its own statement also dismissing the allegation:

A couple hours later Chicago station WFLD reporter Rafer Weigel tweeted that the two men were still in custody and that questioning would resume Friday.

As of Friday morning there were no additional reports. There was just anger and frustration that the American people had again been hoodwinked by what to many appears be just another run-of-the-mill fake hate crime designed to make the president look bad.

Please, spare us the fabricated tales of when you smoked weed in college, while listening to rappers who didn’t even record an album yet. Defenders, I’m sure she was replying to another interviewer who was not asking about her taste in music.

Nobody cares about youthful indiscretions involving weed use, and haven’t cared since Bill Clinton claimed he “didn’t inhale,” and then-candidate Barack Obama admitted he was a member of the “choom gang.”

It is more troubling for a candidate to demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of basic economics, or a propensity to obfuscate and prevaricate in the pursuit of political gain.

Claiming tax cuts and refunds are lower than in the previous years, is one such example. Ryan Ellis at the Washington Examiner explained without misdirection:

People may have gotten their tax cut in their weekly paychecks, and not as much from their usual tax refund. People who e-file this early (which means they have nothing more than wage income and simple financial and family setups) have received the bulk of their tax cut already in the form of higher take-home pay throughout the course of last year.

Kamala Harris’ blatant appeal to identity politics, specifically lighting a fire under black’s sensitivities, has no place in the Office of President of the United States.

Clearly, Team Harris has determined being a person of color will alone earn her the black vote in Southern primaries, and that she can pivot to whatever passes for a center among the radical progressive left.

For the record, she is not an African American with roots in the nation’s slavery history, but rather a woman of mixed East Indian and Jamaican heritage.

Her plan may very well succeed, as some polls suggest she is now in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden. She is clearly the favorite among progressives in the media blogosphere and Twittersphere, and more importantly among leftwing opinion purveyors in Big Media.

If the exploitation of sectionalism, balkanization and racial animus were not enough to cause them to reconsider Senator Harris for the presidency, consider her repeated rush to judgements for blatant racial appeal.

When the alleged “attack” on Jussie Smollet was initially reported, she tweeted the following:



.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.



This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

It was initially claimed and reported the “Empire” actor was attacked by people wearing MAGA hats who taunted him with racist and homophobic slurs, before putting a “lynching rope” around his neck and dousing him with a chemical agent “which may have been bleach.”

UPDATE: Jussie Smollet appears to have staged the attack. The Chicago Police Department has pushed back on elements of the report, though they raided the home of two actors of two Nigerian descent. At least one appeared on the show “Empire” as a stand-in.

BREAKING: Multiple soucres tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack – allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019

Lynching is a dark and despicable part of our nation’s history, yet it is still not a federal hate crime. Passing a federal anti-lynching law must be a priority for this new Congress.

Surveillance cameras have shown no such attack.

But they did show Mr. Smollett eating a Subway sandwich subsequent to this alleged hate crime. He still refuses to turn over his cell phone to the police, after claiming he was using it during the attack.

Now, it may be that Mr. Smollet made the whole thing up, or it may turn out that his statements about what allegedly happened to him were correct.

But that is not the point.

The point is that a leading candidate for President of the United States used a totally unverified and racially-charged story for blatant political purposes, without first waiting for police confirmation.

That such a person could take this sort of rush-to-judgement attitude to the office of the presidency, is frightening. That such a person could use race to divide the nation when there has been a period of slow and steady healing, is morally criminal.

Kamala Harris must not win the presidency for the betterment of all races."

Reports emerged on Thursday night that suggested the Empire star could have staged his attack with the aim of keeping his job on Empire.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” reads a statement from 20th Century Fox Television.

“He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The comments from Fox came just hours after Bob Elgas, a reporter for ABC7 Chicago shared that, according to his sources, two persons of interest were being questioned about the alleged attack, and that the line of questioning surrounded Smollett conspiring with the pair to stage the attack.

""BREAKING: Multiple soucres tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack – allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” he tweeted, before sharing a second tweet.

“MORE: Someone familiar with the investigation says Smollet was a no-show for an interview earlier today with detectives.""

""All of this coming hours after Smollett spoke to @GMA speaking out in his first media interview taking aim at those who doubted his story.”

Chicago PD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, issued a statement on Thursday in the aftermath of these claims saying, “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.""

""[Superintendent] Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

In the early hours of January 29, Smollett visited a doctor just hours.

Two ""unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department in January.

""The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.""

The chemical was believed to be bleach at the time.

""At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim's neck,"" the statement continued. ""The offenders fled the scene.""

Smollett also told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack.

The two who were questioned are brothers, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He added in a brief phone interview that police had searched their homes Tuesday. The two are currently not considered suspects, the spokesman said, adding that interviews would continue on Friday. He said he did not know what role the one man played on the Fox show.

Smollett, a star of the Fox television show Empire who said late last month that he had been assaulted by two men yelling homophobic and racial slurs in downtown Chicago, told Good Morning America in an interview broadcast Thursday morning that he was “pissed off” by the attack and those who doubted his story, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Hours after the segment was broadcast, Chicago police said they were interrogating two men believed to be the persons of interest seen in surveillance video images released in late January.

Smollett expressed frustration that his story was being met with doubt.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “A lot more.”

The actor had previously released a statement saying he was OK and expressed dismay over “inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread.”

In the interview, Smollett, who is black and gay, recounted for the first time publicly what happened that night and what he told the police.

He said that he landed in Chicago that evening and was picked up at the airport by his creative director, Frank Gatson. When they arrived at Smollett’s apartment, there was no food, Smollett said, so he went out to stop at Walgreens, which had closed. Then, Smollett said, he went to Subway to get a salad and on the way, he got on the phone with his manager, who was in Australia.

At this point, two men accosted him, he said. One of them yelled, Empire, and then shouted racial slurs. The attackers also told Smollett this was “MAGA country,” in a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Smollett said the altercation then became physical and that Smollett’s manager was on the phone the whole time. Before the two men ran off, Smollett said, they placed a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

“It felt like minutes but it probably was like 30 seconds,” Smollett said, adding, “I can’t tell you honestly. I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming.”

Previously, the most concrete development in the case had come within days of the incident, when Chicago Police released images of two men caught on surveillance video who were identified as “potential persons of interest.” Smollett said in the ABC interview that he was convinced that these were the two men responsible for attacking him.

“Because I was there,” Smollett said. “For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere.’ I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Earlier Thursday, Guglielmi said that the two men were identified as a result of a “meticulous investigation” and “a review of transportation records.”

Aside from the two men, evidence has been hard to come by. Last week, a New York Post reporter found an empty hot sauce bottle that smelled of bleach near the site where Smollett said the attack occurred. That bottle has been turned over to the police, but it has not been established as being connected to Smollett. The lack of witnesses, surveillance video and any other corroborating evidence has spurred theories that have frustrated Smollett.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative,” Smollett said. “I’m not going to go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous and it’s offensive.”

Smollett has been criticized for not providing his full phone records to authorities. This week, Smollett handed over what Chicago police called heavily redacted records. A spokesman for the department said that they “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.” On ABC, Smollett defended his reluctance to give up more, citing privacy concerns.

“I have private pictures and videos and numbers,” Smollett said. “My partner’s number. My family’s number. My castmates’ numbers. My friends’ numbers. My private email. My private songs. My private voice memos.”

Law enforcement has continued to say publicly that thus far there is no reason to doubt Smollett’s story.

The incident has received an avalanche of national attention. Even Trump weighed in, saying in the Oval Office that the attack was “horrible” and that it “doesn’t get worse.”

On the president weighing in, Smollett said, “I saw it. I don’t know what to say to that. You know, I appreciate him not brushing over it.”

Smollett also addressed a threatening letter that was sent to Fox studios in Chicago before the attack, which the FBI has taken the lead on investigating. The actor said that he thought the incident and the letter were connected and that the return address on the letter said “MAGA.”

“On the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it with the words that says, Smollett Jussie, you will die,” Smollett said, adding that there was a racial slur.

The return address was “in big red caps,” Smollett said: “Did I make that up, too?”

Smollett said that his attackers’ motivations were clear, based on what he heard them say.

“I will never be the man that this did not happen to,” Smollett said. “I am forever changed.”

It appears that another politically-charged, victimology ploy is being unraveled as a sham. This time, there are criminal implications. For those not aware, Jussie Smollett, an actor on the show “Empire”, went through great lengths to make it appear as if he were a victim of a hate crime committed by folks “wearing MAGA hats.”

Police have said the 36-year-old actor was walking home from a Subway restaurant in Streeterville around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, when two men attacked him near his apartment. Smollett told police his attackers yelled racist and homophobic slurs, put a noose around his neck, and doused him with a chemical sources said appears to have been bleach.

But still, people hear what they want to hear, and they’ve already heard it and closed their ears. Social media is on fire with rage over “another black, gay man being attacked.” Left-wing news sources in the MSM are not covering the facts or investigative reporting in this case. They did their job and reported out the flashy, sound-bite headlines that sucked in the masses and set them off on a prescribed path of blame-Trump outrage.

WHO KNEW? She writes:

In the late ’70s there was a horrendous spate of child murders in the Atlanta area. Once it became clear that a serial monster was on the loose, people sprang into action. It was all little black children, almost all boys. Racist slanders to the contrary, white people were just as appalled as black people. Committees were formed, ribbons were worn, buttons were sold that said, “Stop the Racist Murders.” OBVIOUSLY, it was racist, right? Who in their right mind would believe that a black man had done such hideous things to black children? Then they arrested Wayne Williams for two murders and seemed to connect him to several others. He was black and the community reeled, so much so that there is still doubt that he was the one.

But save those “stop the racist attacks” ribbons because next came Tawana Brawley, pathetic little black girl attacked by WHITE COPS in New York who smeared her with dog feces. Again, white people were appalled, ashamed and even righteous cop-supporters were worried. What would make people do such a thing? Oopsie. She did it herself – with help – no cops; no white people. If YOU had participated in such a hoax, you might still be in prison. Ah, but not Al Sharpton. He has a job in television and owes several million dollars in back taxes. And you thought crime didn’t pay!

Examples of other hate crime hoaxes of a racial nature abound, from “white” Hispanics to bananas in trees. Then just a few weeks ago, we got PROOF POSITIVE that a couple of white guys had walked right up to a car with a little black girl in it and fired bullets into the car without any regard for human life, killing the little black girl. Thank God we had EYE WITNESSES – the surviving family members of the murdered child told all and sundry that the murderers were not only white men but had blue eyes, that’s how close they had been.

Oopsie. Nope. Just garden variety black thugs who may or may not have had a drug or gang beef with the “adults” in whose unfortunate care the little girl had found herself. We’ll never know because there’s nothing to see here anymore.

And now we have Jussie, gay black actor assaulted in Chicago. OMG, he says he went out for “something to eat” at 2:00 a.m. And that is the only thing he has said that I believe is true.

Let even the bare facts that we know sink in: he went out in absolutely frigid weather at 2:00 a.m. in dangerous Chicago. He couldn’t have a pizza delivered? He couldn’t make a peanut butter sandwich? The only people I have known who would go out at any time, in any weather, were hard-core smokers out of cigarettes. Or gay men looking for another anonymous, death-defying hookup. I have seen no evidence of a successful hook-up. But neither is there any evidence of a crime. So, how did the rope get around his neck?

Let’s see – how to fan the flames of racist anti-white hate, get some publicity for his career, AND become some kind of martyr/hero to such morons as Cory Booker who thinks we need a new “anti-lynch” law. Because murder and assault are not already illegal. Not that Jussie was actually lynched, despite greeting the cops at his door with a rope still around his neck.

And who did this to him? Oh, but of course. Two white men who “recognized” him in a television drama not 12 white people in America probably watch, all bundled up in clothes in the dark so that probably his own mother couldn’t have recognized him. My former gay, black hairdresser, now, sadly, dead of AIDS, said when he moved from the South to Minneapolis in winter, he thought he was the only black person in Minnesota because people were so bundled up at the bus stop that he couldn’t even tell their race.

Jussie’s racist attackers were just a couple of icky white people out at 2:00 a.m. carrying a bottle of bleach and a rope — on spec — just in CASE a random black or gay person happened to be out on the street looking for something to eat. Yes, happens all the time. Because Trump.

I know several dozen Trump voters personally. One thing stands out about all of us – the ones with the black or brown grandchildren, the ones with the gay children or friends, and especially those of us who are elderly and in bed by 9:00 p.m. – we don’t always go out in urban America late at night. But when we do, we always carry noxious chemicals and rope so if we run across any of those “Others” Obama was always going on about, we can hurl appropriate epithets and bleach at them while saying, “This is MAGA country!”

But, wait, there’s more! Ah yes, Jussie was on the phone with his manager at the exact moment when the attack took place! What ARE the chances? MY manager in Atlanta would have been just delighted to hear from me at 2:00 a.m. Did Jussie say, “Help, Mr. Manager, call 911 right now because some icky white people are attacking me?” No, probably not, but he won’t give up his phone to the cops anyway. Did he take a picture of his assailants with that phone? No. Does he have any defensive wounds on his fists or DNA under his fingernails? We don’t know. But, his manager DID “hear” the assailants yell, “This is MAGA country.”

That is particularly hilarious. The two icky white MAGA people didn’t STEAL his phone or dislodge it when they were putting the clothesline around his neck. They didn’t even take his Subway. Uh-huh.

Let’s say just for the sake of fun that the manager DID hear SOMEONE say, “This is MAGA country!” Jussie is an ACTOR. He can talk any way he wants to talk. Have you ever listened to a Book on Tape? ONE talented actor reads all the parts – men, women, Southern accents, black accents, old people voices – they can do it all. He says his preposterous story is “consistent.” He is an actor. He memorizes a script every week.

But by all means, let’s task the Chicago cops with looking through hundreds of hours of security tape in the area. Let’s send them off looking for “Persons of Interest” all bundled up and also out on the deserted streets. It was well below freezing – where is the puddle of frozen bleach? Where are any blood stains from the alleged beat-down?

And what if everything Jussie said happened turns out to be true? Well, that would be a sickening criminal incident, not unlike what the elderly victims of the “Knock-out Game” must have experienced. Never heard of the Knock-out Game? There’s a reason for that – the elderly white people who were smashed in the face were hit by young thugs of color as a kind of contest to see who could render an old white person unconscious with one punch. Did Cory Booker or Nancy Pelosi ever weigh in on that, propose “anti-geezer beating” legislation, or send wishes for a speedy recovery to the victims? If not, then I have lost interest in their crocodile tears now. And those attacks actually happened.

But he says they have not been charged in the Jan. 29 attack. Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers.

ABC News added that the two men ""have a relationship with Jussie.""

***Original Post**

Let’s rewind to January, not that long ago. Jussie Smollett, star on the television series Empire on Fox, alleged that he was the victim of a possible hate crime. He got punched, had poured bleach on him, and had a rope tied around his neck. The attackers allegedly yelled “this is MAGA country’ during the reported assault (via USA Today):

Chicago Police say they are still searching for the assailants who attacked ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett early Tuesday morning in what Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi says they are investigating as a ""possible hate crime."" ...Guglielmi said police have established ""potential persons of interest"" in the assault. He added that, ""A community alert (with) photos is being constructed and will be disseminated shortly” […] …. Guglielmi said that Smollett, who had returned Chicago one day earlier for work, was fully cooperating with investigators and helping them establish a timeline of the assault. The latest: 'Empire' star Jussie Smollett: Police locate 'persons of interest' on surveillance camera ""Hate will not win: 'Empire' co-star Taraji P. Henson decries Jussie Smollett attack Guglielmi told USA TODAY that Smollett, 36, was approached in the early hours of Tuesday morning by two people who ""gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,"" adding that they punched him in the face, poured a chemical on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to have the cuts on his face and neck treated. He was described as being in good condition and on Wednesday, his representative, Pamela Sharp, told USA TODAY that he was ""recovering well."" Sgt. Cindy Guerra confirmed to USA TODAY that Smollett said in a follow-up interview the next day that his alleged attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

When this was first reported, actress Ellen Page took some time during her interview with Stephen Colbert to blame…Mike Pence [emphasis mine]:

wherein Ellen Page blames the alleged attack against Jussie Smollett on Mike Pencepic.twitter.com/Vy3MJC0DBn — Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) February 1, 2019

In her nine minutes sitting across from Stephen Colbert, Page spoke passionately on a number of issues including climate change, which the actress said the media is not covering sufficiently. Additionally, Page called the media cowardly—“saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime.” In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked by two white men who were reportedly wearing ski masks, and who put a noose around his neck while using anti-gay and racist slurs. At one point, the men reportedly screamed, “This is MAGA country!” Chicago police have said they’re treating the attack as a possible hate crime. “It’s absurd,” Page said. “This shit isn’t a debate. “Sorry,” she added. “I’m really fired up tonight. But it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. . . . He wanted to ban [gay marriage] in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt L.G.B.T.Q. people so badly as the [governor] of Indiana.”

Well, first file that outburst under"" not helping."" Second, we have an issue pinning down what exactly happened because there are some shoddy aspects to this whole story. Smollett’s manager has corroborated the “MAGA country “ line because he was on the phone with his client when he was allegedly attacked. And yet, Smollett won’t turn over the phone to police investigating the incident. But wait; we now have two ""persons of interest""and one of them worked on Empire (via NYT) [emphasis mine]:

One of the two men interviewed by the police in connection with a reported attack on the “Empire” star Jussie Smollett has appeared on the show, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said late Thursday night. The two who were questioned are brothers, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He added in a brief phone interview that the police had searched their homes on Tuesday. The two are currently not considered suspects, the spokesman said, adding that interviews would continue on Friday. He said he did not know what role the one man played on the Fox show. […] Aside from the two men, evidence has been hard to come by. Last week, a New York Post reporter found an empty hot sauce bottle that smelled of bleach near the site where Smollett said the attack occurred. That bottle has been turned over to the police, but it has not been established as being connected to Smollett. The lack of witnesses, surveillance video and any other corroborating evidence has spurred theories that have frustrated Smollett. […] Smollett has been criticized for not providing his full phone records to the authorities. This week, Smollett handed over what the Chicago police called heavily redacted records. A spokesman for the department said that they “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.” On ABC, Smollett defended his reluctance to give up more, citing privacy concerns. “I have private pictures and videos and numbers,” Smollett said. “My partner’s number. My family’s number. My castmates’ numbers. My friends’ numbers. My private email. My private songs. My private voice memos.” Law enforcement has continued to say publicly that thus far there is no reason to doubt Smollett’s story.

A rather startling development arose yesterday; where sources told Chicago media outlets that Smollett might have staged the attack due to him being written off Empire. Fox had to come out and deny that development. Chicago PD also said that reports that Smollett had staged the attack over being written off was not accurate as well, though ABC7 Chicago seemed to have been told something different, as they reported police told them they're looking into whether these two people may have executed this assault, or if the attack happened at all (via ABC7 Chicago) [emphasis mine]:

Chicago police confirmed Thursday that detectives are talking to two persons of interest in connection with the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ""Empire."" A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday, but has since spoken with police. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted ABC7 to say they are continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing. Chicago police told ABC News, ""Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack - or whether the attack happened at all."" Smollett released a statement Thursday evening, saying, ""Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate."" Smollett's representatives said he is not being written off ""Empire."" Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement saying, ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Since then, the two persons of interest are reportedly Nigerian brothers, whose apartment was raided by police Wednesday night. Still, the fact remains that evidence concerning this alleged attack is scarce. No further details about the raid, the timeline, or anything has been released by police. For now, though, as for the suspects, the description initially given has been totally wrong, but maybe not.

Both men are Nigerian and were extras on “Empire.” Based on what the cops have already said, it appears these are the same men who were captured on the surveillance video. According to the report, police seized 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops and other items. (TMZ)

Despite speculation about Smollett possibly staging the attack, Chicago Police have not confirmed a set-up.

The station and a CBS affiliate both reported that cops suspect Smollett orchestrated the attack and enlisted the men’s help. A spokesman for the Chicago Police cast doubt on that narrative. “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said. “We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” he wrote, though the reports don’t specify the sources are law enforcement. (Page Six)

…

TV network Fox issued a statement this week addressing the possible fate of Jussie’s “Empire” character.

In a statement, Fox denied that Smollett was being written off the show. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.” (Variety)

Kardashian was beside herself with joy and gloated online about her fancy gift that we all can’t afford.

As Jamal Lyon on Fox’s “Empire,” Jussie Smollett portrays one of primetime television’s most prominent gay characters of color.

The cultural significance of the role isn’t lost on the actor-singer, who came out publicly as gay in 2015. Appearing on SiriusXM’s “The Clay Cane Show” Wednesday, he explained why he insisted that Jamal’s love interest on “Empire” be a man of color, too.

“There was talk about Jamal having a white boyfriend,” Smollett recalled. “And I said, ‘Fuck no!’ Not for any reason, except we have a responsibility and we have a such a beautiful opportunity to show two black men in a relationship together, in a healthy relationship.”

Listen to a clip of Smollett’s “The Clay Cane Show” interview below.

Stressing that his casting view “wasn’t anything against white men,” he continued, “This is what I hope, this is what I want to see and this is what I wish I had seen as a kid. If I had seen certain things as an adolescent, I would’ve had a much different understanding of who I am.”

Jamal began dating a journalist, Kai (played by Toby Onwumere), on “Empire” early in the show’s fifth season, which debuted in September. In the season’s fourth episode, Kai disclosed that he was HIV positive.

Mainstream entertainment has, of course, suffered from a noticeable lack of diversity. The 2017 Hollywood Diversity Report, which surveyed 1,206 TV shows that were airing or streaming in the 2014-2015 season, found that people of color had made gains relative to their white counterparts in front-of-camera roles. But when it came to behind-the-scenes positions like writing and directing, they lost ground.

Later in his interview, Smollett pointed to the Oscar-winning 2016 film “Moonlight” as an example of Hollywood depicting issues that impact queer people within the black community specifically ― and doing it right.

“It was just beautiful,” he said of the film, which starred Mahershala Ali, Janelle Monáe and Trevante Rhodes. “It was also not about sexuality, it was actually about masculinity and the rules that are put on little boys, specifically little black boys, from the moment that they are born that we never really talk about.”"

THE BUZZ

SCOOP. Get ready for the ad war. Fight Back for a Better Tomorrow , an independent expenditure PAC that played a central role in the Illinois midterms, is back. It’s made a $714,000 ad buy to attack mayoral candidate Bill Daley. The Chicago businessman who worked as chief of staff to Barack Obama is preparing for the punch. He’s got his own $1 million ad buy that starts next week.

Advertisement

The attack ad focuses on Daley’s career as a banker. A voice says: “As president of SBC, Daley took a million-dollar bonus and then laid off 5,000 workers. Then as the chairman of a Wall Street bank, Daley took more than $15 million—the same year his bank admitted to illegally overcharging thousands of active duty troops and driving military families into foreclosure, forcing them out of their homes. Bill Daley—a Wall Street banker who got rich off working people.”

Fight Back Fund is connected to the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150—they share the same address and James Sweeney, the head of Local 150, is an officer with the PAC. The ad buy was made through Left Hook Communications, a left-leaning political strategy firm.

During the 2018 midterms, Fight Back played a huge role in funding conservative former state Sen. Sam McCann’s campaign for governor. McCann ultimately pulled votes away from Republican incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner. Before that, the same independent expenditure PAC spent big money to oppose attorney general candidates Pat Quinn and Scott Drury (both Democrats) and Erika Harold (a Republican).

Other trade unions are helping fund the PAC, according to a source familiar with the organization. It appears Local 150 isn’t supporting any one candidate for mayor, but it knows which one it doesn’t want to win—that would be Daley.

The attack ad comes as Daley caps off a high-profile week. He secured a $1 million donation from hedge fund executive Ken Griffin and the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune. This morning, he’s joining 100 friends and supporters for a fundraiser at Gibsons, a Gold Coast steakhouse that’s been a home away from home for Daley family members for years.

Throughout the mayoral campaign, Bill Daley has faced questions about how he became a millionaire after decades of working at the crossroads of government, politics and business.

Polling numbers in the mayor's race: It’s turned into a five-person dash to the finish, according to results of an exclusive Telemundo Chicago/NBC 5 poll. With 11 days and counting until the election, nearly one in five voters remain undecided. Leading the 14-person pack is Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle with 14 percent of the vote, followed by Bill Daley (13 percent), Susana Mendoza (12 percent), Lori Lightfoot (10 percent), Gery Chico (9 percent), Amara Enyia (7 percent), Jerry Joyce (4 percent), Willie Wilson (4 percent), Garry McCarthy (3 percent), Paul Vallas (2 percent), Bob Fioretti (1 percent), LaShawn Ford (1 percent), Neal Sales-Griffin (1 percent) and John Kozlar (n/a).

TAKING NAMES

The story of the $15 per hour minimum wage that passed the House yesterday (69-41) and heads to the governor’s desk is really a story about Kimberly Lightford, the state Senate majority leader who initiated the legislation. She’s been submitting a minimum wage bill every year since she started in the late 1990s. Lightford was motivated by graduate work she did in the Department of Corrections and then while a trustee in Maywood. “I spent a lot of time in the community. I saw so much poverty. I thought if people work every day and are working hard and putting in full-time hours, why should they be poor.”

Signing the bill: Gov. J.B. Pritzker will sign the minimum wage bill Tuesday—expect fanfare.

In support: “This is going to stimulate the economy,” said Democratic state Rep. Diane Pappas (45th). “When Walmart raised its minimum age to $11 across the nation, they saw their employees spending money at their stores. That’s what’s going to happen in our communities. This money is going to be spent in Illinois. It’s not going to shareholders. The entire state will see dividends.”

The opposition: Republicans voiced concern that jobs would be lost. And Greg Baise, who now heads the new Ideas Illinois PAC, said “We need more discussion.” He worries, Democrats, with their majority in the Assembly, will try to take similar swift action with discussions about changing the states flat-rate tax to a graduated system. “We want to provide a counterbalance to that notion. We should look at different ways to tax as opposed to exclusively spending dollars of the state.” Baise’s Ideas Illinois is the conservative counter to Think Big Illinois, a left-leaning 501(c)(4) that promotes Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s agenda—including the $15 minimum wage and graduated income tax.

The slice of input came from McHenry County Board Chairman Jack Franks at the board's committee of the whole meeting Thursday, when a bulk of board representatives demanded cooperation from the Barrington Hills legislator. At the center of the board's ire is the Republican's proposed township abolishment legislation,” a bill that would allow voters to dissolve McHenry County townships at the polls. Story here

— Bill aimed at paring Madigan’s power stalls in House subcommittee, by Capitol News’ Peter Hancock. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Margo McDermed, R-Mokena, would prohibit the leader of a legislative chamber from serving simultaneously as a state party chairman. Madigan, the longest-serving House speaker in U.S. history, has also chaired the Illinois Democratic Party since 1998. McDermed denied her bill was aimed specifically at Madigan. “It’s not about one person,” she said. “It’s about the ethical conflict that every other state has ruled out.” Story here

""We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says in a tweet. Already circulating, the hoax theory spread as the lawyer representing two Nigerian brothers seen in the area of the attack on Jan. 29 said they knew Smollett from their time working on Empire as extras. ""They're all very cordial,"" Gloria Schmidt tells CBS Chicago. Per CBS and CNN, the men left for Nigeria on the day of the attack and were questioned after returning to O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday, but ""are not considered suspects at this time.""

While CBS reported that bleach and other items were taken from the brothers' apartment Wednesday, ABC7 reported police were investigating the possibility that the men staged the attack with Smollett, who feared he was being written off Empire. The show's writing staff says that was never discussed. Fox, which airs the show, referred to the notion as ""patently ridiculous."" Smollett ""remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the company says, per the Chicago Tribune. Smollett denied inventing the attack in an interview with ABC, saying he was ""pissed off"" by the suggestion. In reference to a threatening letter sent to him at the studio where Empire is filmed, Smollett added, ""Did I make that up too?"" (Much more on the case here.)

From CWBChicago:

Chicago police today are questioning two persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett hate crime investigation, according to a department spokesperson. Both are African-American. Smollett, who police say “has been questioned throughout” their investigation is also being interrogated. The persons of interest were arrested at O’Hare airport on Wednesday night, police said. Smollett said in an interview aired on Good Morning America today that he believed the two persons of interest seen in the CPD images were the persons who attacked him. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Joe Rogan’s adopted daughter, Kayja Rose Rogan, happens to be black. Alex wonders how she must feel now that Joe has been exposed for calling African Americans “apes” in one of his podcasts. TMZ reported that the persons of interest are an actor who has appeared with Smollett on Fox television’s Empire and a person who was traveling with the second actor. These individuals are believed to be the “potential persons of interest” who were seen in low-quality images released by Chicago police days after the alleged attack, according to a police spokesperson. TMZ also reported that police used “rideshare and/or taxicab records” to identify the “persons of interest” and to track their movements on the night of the purported attack.

CWBChicago shared this tip they got last week:

They suspect police had these suspects in their sight all along and used the “heavily redacted” phone records Smollett handed over to nail them because he removed their calls from the list.

As CWBChicago reported: “Investigators already received Smollett’s complete phone records via a subpoena served on his service provider, according to a source close quoted by CWBChicago on Feb. 4.”

“A source familiar with the records provided by the Empire star states that Smollett downloaded his phone activity into a spreadsheet and then deleted certain phone calls before handing over the records. ‘He did the [detectives’] job for them because then they only had to focus on the numbers he deleted.'”

Chicago PD are denying the report:

It has been a tall order trying to get the clouds to clear on any one of these issues. As for the first, stocks have been pinning gains on hopes of a trade deal. Talk of a broad agreement, and a “productive meeting” tweet from Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin may have calmed some nerves as trade wrapped Friday. (see Buzz below).

And while a partial government shutdown is likely off the table, talk of an “emergency declaration” by POTUS will likely keep tensions between he and Congress simmering.

Then there is the economy, and we’ll get a key Michigan consumer sentiment survey Friday, following that gloomy retail sales that momentarily knocked the market from its perch.

“U.S. December retail sales rather shocked financial markets yesterday by seeming to imply that Americans had abandoned their lifelong national past time of spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need,” Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients in a webcast.

“The world can probably breathe easily however, as this can be filed away under the headline of dodgy data,” he said, going on to point out how it was the second-best January for retail employment in 30 years, which hardly jibes with gloomy December sales data.

Our call of the day, from Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors, is less sanguine. She says get inured to data-driven volatility for stocks, thanks to the U.S. central bank.

“The market is currently lacking in direction because there is no guidance from the Fed. So while the market tries to decide what the economic and monetary policy trajectory is, ‘the Fed’s data dependency means volatility will be elevated and markets may be subject to wild swings,’” said Shah in emailed comments.

Shah worries that the market has swung from “excessively pessimistic to excessively optimistic,” and may be underestimating coming headwinds from a global slowdown. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s U-turn is one reason that she likes U.S. and emerging-market equities, she hasn’t got hopes that the current rally will last too much longer.

“If the underlying economy really is that weak, weakening earnings growth will weigh on equities. Or, if the Fed was simply propping up markets, renewed fears of inflation and rising interest rates are likely. Whichever reason you prefer for the Fed’s U-turn, the conclusion is the same: enjoy the ride while it lasts.“

Two Chicago media outlets reported Thursday that multiple sources told them that investigators believe the attack was staged.

Police spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, who are believed to have been seen on surveillance images on the night of the attack.

Rob Elgas, a reporter at ABC 7 in Chicago, reported Thursday afternoon that “multiple sources” said Smollett and the two men staged the attack because his character was being written off the show. Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, cited a source who said investigators believe the “non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.”

Thursday morning an angry Jussie Smollett told Good Morning America about the alleged attack outside his Streeterville apartment.

“I’m pissed off,” he said. “I heard ‘Empire.’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer. I kept walking. And then I heard f****t Empire n****r. So I turned around, and then I said, ‘What the f**k did you just say to me?'”

He says he was beaten, doused with bleach and had a rope wrapped around his neck.

But were the figures on the surveillance video responsible?

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, posted on Twitter that ABC7’s sources are inaccurate.

Detectives are interviewing two “persons of interest” who surveillance photos show were in the area of downtown Chicago where Empire actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked last month, police said Thursday (Feb. 14).

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area at the time Smollett said he was attacked, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck at about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said the reports were “ridiculous rumors.”

“He’s been very cooperative and very consistent,” she said.

In a statement, Fox denied that Smollett was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

Their Chicago home was raided Thursday.

A source told CBS Chicago investigators are looking at whether the men helped the actor stage the incident.

Chicago police tweeted that reports about the ""incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives."" They released a statement Friday, saying, ""Interviews will resume today with the two people of interest and their attorney. While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax.

The brothers are of Nigerian descent and apparently left for Nigeria the same day as the alleged attack.

Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said when they returned Wednesday, they were detained by police at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

She said they could face charges as early as Friday, but what they could be charged with is still unclear. Schmidt said her clients are adamant they had nothing to do with the alleged attack on Smollett.

""They are baffled about why they are people of interest,"" Schmidt said. ""It's an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it's not my guys.""

She added that her clients have worked with Smollett on the set of ""Empire"" and have spent time with him at the gym.

She said they were as shocked as everyone else when they learned about the possible hate crime. ""This is someone that they know, this is someone that they've worked with. So they don't want to see somebody go through that,"" Schmidt said.

Last month, Smollett told police two men beat him around 2 a.m. near his Chicago apartment. Police later released two surveillance images of the persons of interest.

Smollett, who is gay, told police the attackers doused him in an unknown substance that smelled like bleach and tied a rope around his neck. He detailed the alleged attack in a recent interview, saying, ""I see the attacker masked and he said, 'This MAGA country (bleep).' Punches me right in the face. So I punched his (bleep) back. So we started tussling. … There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back.""

When police raided the Chicago home of the persons of interest Wednesday night, doors were broken and clothes and belongings tossed around. CBS Chicago reports that police removed bleach, a ""black facemask hat,"" a red hat, an ""Empire"" script, receipts and other items.

""I've never been some media whore,"" Smollett said. ""That's not who I am. I don't look for that type of attention.""

Smollett has denied being involved in or making up the assault. He said he hopes the suspects will be found.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" he said. ""I am forever changed.""

20th Century Fox and writers for ""Empire"" are pushing back on reports Smollett was being written off the show when this incident took place.

Smollett's publicist said he answered routine follow-up questions for Chicago police Thursday and continues to cooperate."

Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Times newspaper the two are currently not considered suspects but confirmed their homes had been searched earlier in the week.

""My preliminary investigations show that on set it's very tight. They're all very cordial with each other, so they're baffled why they are people of interest.""

Meanwhile, Jussie opened up about the attack on 'Good Morning America' on Thursday, and admitted it had all happened ""so fast"" while he was out getting food but he didn't realise he had a noose around his neck or had a substance, possibly bleach, poured on him until afterwards.

He told Robin Roberts: ""I went to the Subway, got my order.

""During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia... I said, 'Call me when you can.' He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, 'Empire!' And I don't answer to Empire, my name ain't Empire.

""And I didn't answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ""f***ing 'Empire' n****r.' So I turned around and I said, 'What the f**k did you just say to me?' And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, 'This MAGA country, n****r,' and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his ass back and then we started tussling

""There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.

""It happened so fast. It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.""

Jussie also expressed his fury that people have dismissed his account as a hoax.

He said: ""It became a thing of like, 'Oh, It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

The 'Alien: Covenant' actor admitted he didn't immediately call police because he didn't want to be thought of as ""weak"".

He said: ""There's a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as [LGBTQ] people, are not weak."""

Smollett, who is gay and plays gay character Jamal Lyon in the hip-hop drama, said late last month that two men had wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance over him.

His account is ""100% factual and consistent on every level"", he said a couple of days later.

But Chicago ABC7 TV said ""multiple sources"" had told the network that officers are examining whether the apparent assault by two men was faked because Smollett was being written out of the New York-set drama.

The channel quoted officers as saying: ""Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack - or whether the attack happened at all.""

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said ABC's report was ""unconfirmed by case detectives"".

The channel had been informed, he added in a tweet, that officers had ""no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed sources are uninformed and inaccurate"".

Twentieth Century Fox, which produces Empire, said: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous.

""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Speaking in a TV interview on Thursday, Smollett, 35, said of those who disbelieve him: ""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

Police have not found any video footage of the alleged assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

Two men being questioned know Smollett after working with him on Empire - and are said to be ""baffled"" by police interest in them.

Mr Guglielmi said officers were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were ""alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported"".

He added: ""They are not considered suspects at this time. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.""

The two men were picked up at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they had been visiting family, their lawyer Gloria Schmidt told TV station CBS2.

Ms Schmidt added: ""They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire. They are baffled why they are persons of interest."""

ABC/Lorenzo Bevilaqua(CHICAGO) — Thursday was a big day for developments in the Jussie Smollett attack investigation, including a denial by police in Chicago of media reports that they believed the Empire star staged the whole thing.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” a Chicago PD spokesperson said in a tweet Thursday night. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Some media outlets also reported that Smollett staged the attack to raise his profile because he believed he was being written off of Empire. FOX responded to that claim with a statement declaring “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

As for the investigation itself, police say two persons of interest — one of whom has appeared on Empire — were questioned Thursday for several hours after their homes were raided by police searching for possible evidence. Police retrieved shoes, electronic devices and other items they believe could help them determine whether the two people played any role in the assault. Neither of the persons has been charged.

The two people questioned are the same who appeared in the surveillance images that were released January 30, whom police have since identified. They’re said to be U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent who recently returned to the U.S. from abroad. Gloria Schmidt, attorney for the pair, said they were detained by customs at O’Hare International Airport late Wednesday afternoon and “had no idea what was going on,” including no knowledge of the attack on Smollett.

“When they first learned what happened to him they were horrified,” Schmidt said. “This is someone that they know, this is someone that they work with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.” The attorney added that her clients were “baffled” by why they’re persons of interest.

“It’s an awful thing what happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys,” Schmidt insisted.

Smollett was also questioned again by police Thursday, with what his rep called “routine follow-up questions,” adding that Smollett “continues to cooperate.”

Smollett was allegedly attacked in Chicago January 29 in what police are calling a hate crime. The actor and singer says he was assaulted by two men using racial and homophobic slurs, who then poured an unknown liquid on him and placed a noose around his neck.

Matt Anderson/iStock(WASHINGTON) — A pair of presidential hopefuls joined forces on Thursday as a part of a rejuvenated effort to make lynching a federal hate crime.

Senate lawmakers passed an anti-lynching bill introduced by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott.

The chamber first approved the bill in December, but the House never took up the measure. The Senate once again passed the bill unanimously on Thursday. The House is expected to pick up the bill this time.

The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, introduced in June 2018, would make lynching a hate crime punishable by up to life in prison, according to the bill.

“Lynching is not a relic of a painful past — it is a present and pernicious evil that we still have yet to confront,” Booker, who launched a bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination this year, said in a statement Thursday. “I urge the House of Representatives to take up this bill so that after over 100 years and 200 attempts, we can finally make lynching a federal crime.”

Booker and Harris, who is also vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination, have both referred to the alleged attack against Empire star Jussie Smollett as a “modern-day lynching” and evidence of why the bill should become law.

Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago last month by two men who hit him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him and placed a rope around his neck. The incident is still under investigation.

“Lynchings were acts of violence — they were horrendous acts of violence, and they were motivated by racism,” Harris said. “With this bill, we finally have a chance to speak the truth about our past and make clear that these hateful acts should never happen again. We can finally offer some long overdue justice and recognition to the victims of lynching and their families.”

Congressional lawmakers introduced more than 200 anti-lynching bills during the first half of the 20th century, but none were successful, according to the bill’s authors.

“This has been a long arc, a painful history and a shameful history in this body,” Booker said in a speech from the Senate floor in December. “At the height of lynchings across this country affecting thousands of people, this body did not act to make that a federal crime.”

“At least now, the United States Senate has now acted,” he added. “One hundred senators, no objections. I just want to give gratitude to this body for what we have just done.”

If it passes the Democrat-led House, the bill would head to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement saying: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago police are questioning two “persons of interest” who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

“They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. “They are baffled why they are persons of interest.”

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

“They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi said on Twitter.

Smollett while speaking with Robin Roberts on an episode of “Good Morning America” said, “I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”

He gave details about the attack, described the racist slurs his attackers used and the fight that ensued aftermath.

He called out people who have doubted his story; “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

PEOPLE reports that the police has released photographs of two people they wish to question in relation to the alleged assault on Jussie Smollett.

The Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing how investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the Empire actor’s assailants.

Jussie Smollett was attacked on a subway in Chicago earlier in January while on his way to get food. It was reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Jussie Smollett hospitalised after reportedly being injured in homophobic attack

The Chicago Police Department has raided and invited two persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett assault case.

Jussie Smollett was hospitalised after he was reportedly injured by two men in what looks like a homophobic attack back in January. According to TMZ, the 'Empire' star arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday. He went to a Subway around 2 am because he was hungry. When he walked out someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n****?”

There were reportedly two white men wearing ski masks that viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back. He reportedly suffered a fractured rib, and the attackers put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him as they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”"

Todrick Hall is a YouTube legend and a RuPaul’s Drag Race staple – and he’s not stopping there, as he’s set to join Strictly’s Vick Hope in hosting the YouTube livestream at the Brit Awards.

And he’s not afraid to have favourites, describing Little Mix as a ‘triple threat’.

‘I’m rooting for Little Mix because I love what they’re doing, I love that they’re becoming so international – opening up for Ariana Grande, working with Nicki Minaj,’ he revealed to Metro.co.uk.

‘I think they have such a bright future, not only in Europe but in America too. I also love the fact they they are all such strong triple threats, so fashionable and such huge advocates of the queer community.’

He added: ‘I have watched so many of the performances on YouTube and always wished that I could go there, so I am really honoured to be a part of the Brits. I can’t wait to host backstage!’

Aside from YouTube, music, fashion, and his many other talents, some know Todrick as a choreographer for iconic show RuPaul’s Drag Race.

However, not everyone is easy to work with.

‘Michelle Visage,’ he immediately laughed when asked who the most difficult queen is.

‘LOL. Michelle Visage was the person I was most afraid to sit next to on RuPaul’s Drag Race, but now she has become like a second mother to me.’

Toddy added: ‘Every decision I have about a boy, fashion or musical ideas I always run through Michelle because if it can get the Visage stamp of approval, I know it’s going to be a huge success.’

Considering his huge successes so far, we don’t think she’s done too badly.

Others have found the 33-year-old through his appearance on Queer Eye, when he helped a transgender guy to perfect his style – however, he reveals he had no idea what a phenomenon the show was going to become, as he explains he’d ‘love to’ work with the Fab Five again.

‘I had no idea what a huge phenomenon Queer Eye was going to be, you know it’s always hit or miss with remakes, but this was absolutely a huge hit. I loved working with Skyler and being able to be a part of his episode.

‘He’s been a huge supporter of mine for years and now we’ve created this incredible bond because of the show. I think that we will be friends for life because of Queer Eye. So I would absolutely love to go back on the show on a future season.’

And, despite his success, he loves staying true to his roots and making videos on YouTube.

‘I do think the YouTube platform has changed so much but I love the fact that there’s a place for everyone,’ he explained.

‘When I was growing up, the only TV I felt that was catered towards me was the Disney Channel – and there were no gay characters on there then. I think that YouTube has a lot to do with the fact that Disney now feels comfortable posting something like that.

‘There are so many kids that watch their channel who are going to identify with these queer stories, that before never had a place where they felt they could go and watch people who looked or sounded like them.

Toddy once feared Michelle Visage (Picture: Getty)

‘And now because of YouTube, it has given even mainstream media the permission to think outside the box.’

True to his word, Todrick’s created a corner of the internet that makes everyone feel welcome.

Referring to speaking out about being a black gay man in the public eye, he said: ‘It’s more something that I want to do [than a responsibility]. I think that there’s a lot of pressure sometimes to share your opinion on things, but I try to only voice my opinions on things that move me personally and strike a chord within my heart.’

In light of the attack on his friend Jussie Smollett, he added: ‘I love Jussie and I’m praying that this whole thing turns out in a positive light and that it changes the way people view our community.’

So what’s set for Toddy’s future?"

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A man who says he was unlawfully detained on his wedding day by a Pennsylvania judge who wrongly suspected he was in the United States illegally is suing, alleging violations of his constitutional rights. Alexander Parker on Thursday sued Camp Hill-based District Judge Elizabeth Beckley, two court entities and an unidentified court officer Parker says told him he wasn’t free to leave.

The federal lawsuit claims Guatemala-born Parker and his fiancee went to Beckley’s court office to get married in May 2017. But Beckley’s suspicions prompted her to call U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Parker says that after hours of being detained, federal investigators confirmed he’s a legal resident. Beckley eventually married the couple. Beckley didn’t return messages seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the state court system offered no immediate comment.

DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Pennsylvania drug bust has led to a new resident at a zoo in Delaware: an alligator. News outlets report the Brandywine Zoo is caring for the 2-foot-long (0.60-meters) alligator that was discovered at a Coatesville, Pennsylvania home during the Feb. 8 drug bust. The zoo agreed to house the alligator at the request of a district attorney.

It’ll become an educational animal for zoo visitors during the summer. Afterward, it’ll be moved to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park in Florida. The alligator was discovered as police executed a search warrant at a home and seized drugs, cash and drug packaging materials. Thirty-one-year-old Irvin “Gotti” Hawkins, 35-year-old Aki Gathright and 40-year-old Tyrone Jackson were charged in the case. It’s unclear if they have lawyers who could comment.

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Hunting and fishing groups have teamed up to support a plan for preventing Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes. They have formed the Great Lakes Conservation Coalition, which will push for funding of a strategy proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The $778 million plan calls for installing technologies such as noisemakers and a water-flushing lock at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois.

The goal is to prevent the carp from migrating upstream to Lake Michigan. Scientists say the invasive fish could out-compete native species if they become established in the lake. The Michigan United Conservation Clubs is a member of the new coalition. Director Amy Trotter says a carp invasion could harm an outdoor sports industry that pumps $11.2 billion into the state’s economy annually.

CHICAGO (AP) — There is word of some progress in the investigation into the incident involving “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. Detectives in Chicago are now interviewing two people police have described as “persons of interest” in the case. Police have said that the men aren’t considered suspects — but may have been in the area at the time Smollett said he was beaten by two masked men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him.

Police say the persons being questioned aren’t considered suspects. But they are the same people seen in surveillance photos released after the attack occurred last month. In an interview that aired on ABC yesterday, Smollett says he has no doubt that the two men captured on the surveillance are the two men who attacked him.

HOLLYWOOD (AP) – Would anyone — anyone at all — like to thank the academy? This is normally the time of year when Oscar hopefuls are readying acceptance speeches that almost always begin with a few words of gratitude for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. But that sentiment has been hard to come by in the torturous and troubled lead-up to the 91st Academy Awards.

After a litany of public-relations disasters, backtracks and missteps, the latest dust-up surrounds the film academy’s plans to remove four categories from the live portion of Feb. 24’s broadcast, including cinematography and editing, arguably the two most foundational components of moviemaking. The academy, desperate to reverse sliding ratings, says a shortened show must go on.

On Wednesday evening, dozens of Hollywood heavyweights — including Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Brad Pitt, cinematographer Roger Deakins and director Damien Chazelle — issued an open-letter to the academy’s leadership blasting the decision to not air the four awards, which also include live-action short and hairstyling and makeup, live on the ABC telecast.

EL PASO, Texas (AP) — Not in the Valentine’s Day spirit? A Texas zoo has a cockroach that can help.

The El Paso Zoo is running a promotion called “Quit Bugging Me” that allows people to name cockroaches after ex-spouses, former friends or anyone else on the nope list. On Thursday, the cockroaches will be fed to various zoo animals.

The zoo’s Facebook page features dozens of pink-heart graphics showing black cockroaches and various first names or initials of people’s exes. Zoo officials say the response has been so overwhelming that they’ve had to cut off the submission period. The zoo’s meerkats exhibit will be decorated with the submitted names on Thursday. And later in the day, cockroaches will be fed to meerkats, tamarins, marmosets and other zoo animals.

NEWARK, Del. (AP) — A man’s nap in the back of his car in Delaware turned into a nightmare after the car he was sleeping in was stolen and crashed. Musician Justin Koerner told the News Journal he had spent a night playing music with friends, went to sleep in his vehicle and had a dream involving someone jumping in his front seat.

A Newark police statement says someone drove off in the car Sunday morning and bailed after seeing the man sleeping in the back. Police say the car crashed. Koerner says he awoke and saw car treads on a lawn and a destroyed bush, then realized he hadn’t been dreaming. He says police appeared ready to take him away before another officer said a neighbor had security camera footage of the incident.

WINDSOR, N.C. (AP) — Drivers were startled to see a hungry bear that got stuck in the back of garbage truck and took a ride across a stretch of eastern North Carolina. News outlets report that a motorist called Bertie County 911 on Wednesday morning about a bear hanging off of the truck on U.S. Route 17.

Apparently, the snack-seeking bear climbed into the trash truck during a stop and became trapped after the driver secured the netting that prevents garbage from blowing out. Sheriff John Holley says a deputy stopped the truck with the bear perched on top just outside of Windsor. The driver, who hadn’t been aware of the stowaway, pulled back the net and the bear ran off before the truck continued on to the landfill.

EL PASO, Texas (AP) — There are some folks who had people buy dinner for them for Valentine’s Day. But it wasn’t the kind of thing that created a warm and fuzzy feeling. More like a creepy crawly one. That’s because the El Paso Zoo ran a promotion called “Quit Bugging Me.”

It let people name cockroaches after ex-spouses, former lovers or anyone else who, well, “bugs” them. And yesterday, those bugs were fed to various zoo animals. Not surprisingly, the promotion was quite popular. Zoo officials say they got so many requests to feed ex-spouses, lovers or others who irked to animals yesterday — they had to shut down the promotion early.

The actor alleged that he was attacked in a shocking racist and homophobic assault last month, with police later confirming that the incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

While new reports have suggested that Smollett may have staged the attack to allay fears that he was being written out of Empire, police have now categorically denied these claims.

In a statement, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

While police spent Thursday interviewing two men of interest, Guglielmi said there is “no evidence” to support the claims, which have been detailed by outlets including ABC7.

Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, was allegedly attacked by two men who hurled homophobic and racist abuse at him in Chicago on January 29.

Earlier this week, the 36-year-old star made an emotional appearance on Good Morning America and described how he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

“I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to,” he said.

Two local media reports recently alleged the Empire actor had been in on the assault, but police have said these claims are “unconfirmed”.

The 35-year-old African American actor, who came out as gay in 2015, was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago last month. Police said the men struck Smollet in the face before pouring an “unknown chemical substance” over him and wrapping a rope around his neck. They also shouting racial and homophobic slurs during the assault.

‘We have no evidence to support their reporting’

On Thursday, local media reports implied Smollett may have engineered the incident along with two men after he feared he was being written out of Empire.

However, detectives have issued a statement denying this is the case. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

“Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

Fox, the network which produces Empire, released a statement to say Smollett was “core” to the show and was not being written out.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement read.

‘I am forever changed’

The 36-year-old made an emotional appearance on Good Morning America on Thursday and said he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett said in the interview that wants the identity of his allergy attacker to be found.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack.

It has been two and a half weeks since Jussie Smollett reported that he was the victim of a hate crime, and in that time, his story has fallen apart completely. Recent developments in the case have suggested that the Empire actor staged his own assault with the help of two others in a desperate attempt to stay relevant as his character was possibly being written off the show. A CBS Chicago reporter broke the news Thursday evening that the home of the two ""persons of interests"" in the widely circulated community alert was raided by Chicago police. In that raid, they seized a list of items including multiple containers of bleach, a ""red hat,"" an Empire script, a Mossberg rifle, and two computers. The home is occupied by the two men, and at least one is an extra on Jussie Smollett's show, Empire. The pair left for their home country of Nigeria immediately after the ""attack.""

TMZ reported that these men were taken into custody at O'Hare Airport Wednesday night when they re-entered the country and were immediately brought in for questioning by police, who had been monitoring their travels. An attorney for the two Nigerian men said charges against her clients are expected to be filed on Friday. According to the TMZ report, Jussie Smollett was picked up Thursday morning and has also been interrogated. While it is continuing to update its story, it should be noted that TMZ was the first to break Jussie's story and make the first claim that the alleged assault was committed by Trump-supporters. TMZ's reporters are now reframing the story to represent the hoax that it is.

Jussie Smollett. Credit: Dominick D via Flickr. Sources close to Chicago reporters have said the police were able to crack the case after their request for Smollett's call log was denied by the actor. They subpoenaed the phone records instead and continued to publicly treat Smollett as a victim of a hate crime. When he finally turned over a PDF file of his call log nearly two weeks later, investigators were able to examine which calls the actor omitted compared to their own official copy. His own tampering with the call log helped police narrow down which calls were important and who might have assisted in the hoax. It's not clear whether Smollett was even attacked. If he was assaulted at the hands of co-conspirators from his own show or if he was attacked randomly (not an unlikely scenario in Chicago) and used it as an opportunity to promote his anti-Trump rhetoric, he has lied and opened himself up to criminal charges. The mainstream media are just much as to blame and acted every part of the accomplices. They used an uncorroborated story and pushed it as if it were real and used it to crucify American culture. They used phrases like ""epidemic of hate crimes"" and emotionally charged language to make claims about all Trump-supporters that were always unsubstantiated. This is only the most highly publicized hate crime hoax since Trump was elected president. Breitbart keeps a running list of over a hundred others, and most of the perpetrators claimed to have done it to ""raise awareness of issues in this country."" This is eerily similar to remarks Smollett already made in his Good Morning America interview, where he declared that he was ""pissed"" about people who were claiming that this was a hoax along and telling them, ""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth."" Jussie Smollett has made what fame he had by being a social justice warrior, staunchly opposed to President Trump and creating an identity all about standing up to racism. I imagine he dealt with a real assault to his worldview when all these MAGA hat-wearing bigots never actually materialized. He could have re-evaluated his own misaligned beliefs, but instead, he manufactured a fake hate crime in order to validate the idea that American culture is still battling a racist front. Jussie Smollett; countless celebrities; and the mainstream news, which propagated this hoax as if it were true, have done more to divide Americans along racial lines than the people they are supposedly against. The demand for racism has far outpaced the supply, so radicals like Smollett now use homemade alternatives. Smollett once tweeted, ""Frauds are everywhere."" I couldn't agree more.

Trump expected to declare national emergency for border wall funding

President Donald Trump is expected to sign a funding bill to avoid a government shutdown Friday and then declare a national emergency to receive more funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The move comes after Congress approved legislation on Thursday that would devote $1.375 billion for a 55-mile border barrier, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump demanded. But experts said Trump's move would create a legal morass that could take until the middle of next year to resolve — it would let Trump sidestep Democratic opposition to more wall funding. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called Trump's decision a ""gross abuse of the power of the presidency.""

Pence to visit Auschwitz memorial in Poland

Vice President Pence is scheduled to visit the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland on Friday as he continues a European trip he has used to push the White House's aggressive anti-Iran message. Speaking in Warsaw on Thursday at a U.S.-sponsored meeting on the Mideast, Pence demanded that European countries withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. has already abandoned. Pence blasted Iran's ""authoritarian regime,"" which he said ""endlessly spews hatred against Israel, our most cherished ally."" After his Auschwitz visit, Pence heads to Munich for a security conference.

Jussie Smollett recounts violent attack as police, FOX dispute report it was staged

The second half of Jussie Smollet's interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts aired on ""Nightline"" early Friday as rumors arose around the ""Empire"" star's claim that two men attacked him last month in Chicago. During the interview, Smollett, 36, recounted details of the attack, which he said included racist and homophobic slurs, and also said those doubting him ""don't even want to see this is the truth."" On Thursday, FOX Entertainment and 20th Century FOX Television, which produces the Chicago-based family drama, dismissed a report that said Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the show. In addition, Chicago Police disputed the report, which cited multiple anonymous sources, adding: the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Judge to weigh fight over citizenship question on census

The Trump administration will try to persuade a U.S. judge Friday to let it add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. census for the first time in nearly 70 years, a move that opponents say would lead to an undercount of immigrants and Latinos. Lawsuits by California and numerous cities in the state say asking people whether they are citizens of the U.S. is politically motivated and would discourage immigrants and Latinos from participating in the population count. Judge Richard Seeborg, who is not expected to issue a ruling immediately after closing arguments, has heard nearly a week of testimony last month in the lawsuits.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement read.

Chicago Police have dismissed reports that an attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax.

The US TV star needed hospital treatment last month after a suspected racist and homophobic attack.

Local media reports about the attack being staged are ""unconfirmed"", Chicago police's chief communications officer said. ""We have no evidence to support their reporting.""

Mr Smollett said he's been ""forever changed"" by the attack.

Superintendent Eddie Johnson has contacted local media in Chicago to tell them their ""supposed"" Chicago Police sources are ""uninformed and inaccurate"".

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" the 36-year-old actor said in his first interview since two men punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck.

As time has passed and no progress has been made with the investigation, some have cast doubts about Jussie's version of events.

Recounting the night publicly for the first time, Jussie told American network ABC that he hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride.

""We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak.""

When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach.

""I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened.""

Jussie says he'd just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He says he ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food - something people have questioned as strange.

He told Good Morning America it's ""ridiculous"" that people think he'd lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures.

""Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to Subway,"" he said.

Jussie thinks he would've been doubted less if he said his attacker ""was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black"".

""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

There were claims Jussie had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump.

""I never said that. I didn't need to add anything like that,"" Jussie said.

""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

But the attackers did say ""This is MAGA country"", he said.

The actor thinks he was targeted because he's outspoken about President Trump - who when asked about the attack on Jussie said ""That's horrible, it doesn't get worse"".

""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,"" Jussie said of Trump's comments.

Writers of US show Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack - and after reports that plans to write Jussie off the show led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

Two people who were in the area at the time of the attack are being questioned by police, but they are not yet considered suspects.

The announcement comes as detectives said they had identified and interviewed two men believed to have been seen in surveillance footage near the scene where actor Smollett was attacked late last month.

Smollett, 35, filed a report Jan. 29 with Chicago police stating that he was assaulted by two men who also threw an unknown chemical substance at him. He also told police that the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

The next day, Chicago police released two stills from surveillance footage of two individuals walking down a street with their backs to the camera.

Police said they were ""potential persons of interest"" and were being sought for questioning.

""Through a meticulous investigation (Chicago) detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member,"" Chicago police Chief Communications Office Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday in a tweet.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.""

Smollett's representative said they are ""pleased"" with the development, NBC News reported.

However, later Thursday, a Chicago news organization reported that police sources said the attack was being investigated to see if it was staged by the actor, a claim Chicago police were quick to dismiss.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet.

The communications officer said that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted the news organization to state on the record that ""we have no evidence to support their reporting.""

He added that any Chicago police sources the organization may have spoken with were ""uninformed and inaccurate."""

AURORA, Ill. (AP) - An employee of a manufacturing company opened fire in its suburban Chicago plant Friday, killing five people and wounding five police officers before he was fatally shot, police said.

Aurora, Illinois, Police Chief Kristen Ziman identified the gunman as 45-year-old Gary Martin and said he was believed to be an employee at the Henry Pratt Co. - which makes valves for industrial purposes - in the city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago. She told a news conference that officers arrived within four minutes of receiving reports of the shooting and were fired upon as soon as they entered the 29,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse.

Police said they did not know the gunman's motive.

""May God bless the brave law enforcement officers who continue to run toward danger,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at the news conference.

Hospitals reported treating at least seven patients from the shooting, though their conditions weren't released. Two of the officers were airlifted to trauma centers in Chicago, Ziman said. She said a sixth officer suffered a knee injury. Officials did not say the total number of people injured including police and civilians.

Trump declaration faces uncertain fate in coming court fight

WASHINGTON (AP) - Let the lawsuits begin.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border Friday and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.

That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump's declaration that the ""current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.""

Nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to ""bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defense from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.""

Nigeria delays election until Feb. 23 over 'challenges'

KANO, Nigeria (AP) - Nigeria's electoral commission delayed the presidential election until Feb. 23, making the announcement a mere five hours before polls were set to open Saturday. It cited unspecified ""challenges"" amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country.

Residents of Africa's most populous nation and largest democracy will soon wake up to outrage. Many had relocated for the chance to vote.

""This was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,"" commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. He said more details would be released during an afternoon briefing.

A review of logistics, along with the determination to hold a credible vote, led the commission to conclude that going ahead with the election as planned was ""no longer feasible,"" he said.

Nigeria also postponed the previous presidential election in 2015 because of deadly insecurity in the northeast, which remains under threat from Islamic extremists.

Chicago police release 2 men questioned in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) - Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) - Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges, prosecutors said Friday.

Court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller's office reveal that Manafort faces possibly the lengthiest prison term in the Russia investigation. The 69-year-old Manafort is also at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if a federal judge imposes a sentence within federal guidelines.

The potential sentence stems from Manafort's conviction last year on eight felony counts related to an elaborate scheme to conceal from tax authorities the millions of dollars he earned overseas from Ukrainian political consulting. It is one of two criminal cases pending against Manafort in which he faces prison time.

Manafort, who led Trump's campaign for months during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not charged with any crimes directly related to Russian election interference, the thrust of Mueller's probe. But prosecutors have recently revealed that they remain deeply interested in his contacts during and after the campaign with an associate the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.

In a 27-page court filing Friday, prosecutors did not recommend a precise sentence for Manafort, but they agreed with a calculation by federal probation officials that his crimes deserve a punishment of between 19.5 and 24.5 years. They also lay out in great detail for U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III how they say Manafort's greed drove him to disregard American law.

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) - Attorney Gloria Allred told The Associated Press Friday she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Allred, who represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven't come forward publicly, spoke a day after attorney Michael Avenatti said he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

""I've made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction (other than Chicago) aware of my concerns that it may, in fact, be my client and I want to protect her privacy,"" Allred told the AP in a telephone interview.

Kelly has been dogged for decades with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred's comments were ""speculative.""

Greenberg also said he wasn't aware of any moves afoot to charge Kelly with anything.

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion grievances with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) - With a public hearing looming and the threat of owners and league officials facing depositions, the NFL settled collusion cases brought by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid.

The league, about to celebrate its 100th season, faced criticism from all sides thanks to the protest movement started by Kaepernick. Many Kaepernick supporters wanted to see him back on the field, while other fans said they wouldn't watch if the league allowed players to protest during the national anthem.

The league and Kaepernick's lawyer sent out statements Friday saying that ""the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances"" and that a confidentiality agreement would prevent either side from commenting further.

It remains unclear if the NFL admitted wrongdoing or how much money Reid, Kaepernick or others may have received. Considering the lost salary both players claimed and legal costs, the settlement could have climbed into the tens of millions of dollars.

""For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,"" the league statement said. ""As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.""

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) - Payless ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have closed down in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All of the stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

The company said in an email that the liquidation doesn't affect its franchise operations or its Latin American stores, which remain open for business as usual. It lists 18,000 employees worldwide.

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) - Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year's Oscar broadcast.

All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

""Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script"" the Academy tweeted Friday.

The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show's length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours.

The academy's move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year's Oscar nominees, including ""Roma"" director Alfonso Cuaron and ""BlacKkKlansman"" filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

Snow too thick to plow keeps skiers from California resorts

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Winter weather enveloping California's mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.

Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometers) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.

I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Thursday evening.

Police have shot down claims that an alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett was staged.

The actor is alleged to have been beaten in a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last month.

There had been reports suggesting that Mr Smollett may have staged the incident along with two men after he feared he was being written out of musical drama Empire.

However, detectives have issued a statement denying this is the case. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Fox, the network which produces Empire, released a statement to say Mr Smollett was ""core"" to the show and was not being written out.

Mr Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, is alleged to have been attacked by men who shouted homophobic and racist abuse in Chicago on January 29.

The 36-year-old made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America this week and said he had been ""forever changed"" by the alleged attack.

He said: ""I will never be the man who this didn't happen to.

""I am forever changed and I don't subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.""

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: ""I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.""

Mr Smollett has starred in Fox's musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack.

Chicago - Chicago police contested media reports on Thursday that officers were investigating whether ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett staged being physically assaulted because he was being written out of the television show. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation. ""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi said in a tweet. Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama 'Empire,' told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on January 29. In an interview with 'Good Morning America' that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of 'Empire' released a statement saying: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Chicago police are questioning two ""persons of interest"" who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on ""Empire"" and were picked up at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

""They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,"" attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. ""They are baffled why they are persons of interest.""

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,"" Guglielmi said on Twitter.

Feb. 15 (UPI) -- Chicago police arrested two suspects Friday after they were questioned in relation to the attack last month against actor Jussie Smollett.

Authorities have not released any charges for Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, brothers in their mid-20s.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime, and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett, 35, filed a report Jan. 29 with Chicago police stating he was assaulted by two men who also threw an unknown chemical substance at him. He told police the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

The next day, Chicago police released two stills from surveillance footage of two individuals walking down a street with their backs to the camera.

Investigators believe the Osundairo brothers are the two men pictured in the surveillance images.

A source told the Chicago Sun-Times that at least one of the two suspects worked on the show Empire with Smollett and that both are from Nigeria. The two traveled to Nigeria on Jan. 29 and returned Wednesday, when they were detained.

Smollett's representative said he was ""pleased"" Thursday when he learned of the questioning, NBC News reported."

One month after surviving a brutal attack in Chicago, Jussie Smollett sat down with Good Morning America on Thursday morning for an emotional interview. During his conversation with Robin Roberts, Smollett recapped the traumatic incident and possible hate crime, recalling how his masked attacker used racist and homophobic slurs, punched him, poured bleach on him, and hung a rope around his neck. In the weeks since the disturbing attack and consequent hospitalization , Smollett’s account has been questioned by skeptics—which the actor noted during his G.M.A. sitdown.

“At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it—’cause it’s the truth!’” the Empire actor said. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth!’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”

Hours later, in a twist that may have proven Smollet’s point, a local Chicago news outlet reported that police were investigating “whether Smollett and two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of Empire. ” Within two hours of ABC7 reporter Rob Elgas posting the claim on Twitter, it had had been retweeted over 5,800 times by users who shared the report with their followers, and so on.

https://twitter.com/RobElgasABC7/status/1096197727782924288

Smollett’s representative swiftly denied the report in an e-mail response to Vanity Fair. “Today, Jussie did answer routine follow-up questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” Pamela Sharp wrote, contradicting ABC7’s report that the actor “failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday.” Sharp added, “There is no evidence to support [ABC7’s report] and Jussie was NOT written off Empire. ”

Moments later, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment also issued a statement denying the report.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago Police additionally shot down the local report—with spokesman Anthony Guglielmi releasing a strongly worded clarification on Twitter: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. [Superintendent] Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed C.P.D. sources are uninformed and inaccurate.

https://twitter.com/AJGuglielmi/status/1096206043728789507

Even so, outlets like Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Page Six, and Complex re-reported the story—sending a wave across the Internet that emboldened Smollett’s critics and drew out new skepticism. . “This story has sounded made up since the beginning,” one Twitter user wrote, in a response to Elgas’s breaking report. Another added, “Well color me surprised and knock me over with a feather. Clearly, he was lying during his interview with Robin Roberts. His body language wreaked [sic] lying. I hope they make him pay for every damn minute of this investigation. Fraud.”

Since the report broke, Empire co-creator Danny Strong has also come to Smollett’s defense—Tweeting, “There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed.”

https://twitter.com/Dannystrong/status/1096251603173163008

Justin Simien, the creator of Dear White People, reacted to the social-media roller-coaster ride. “The ‘hoax’ claim was debunked within minutes, yet y’all ran with a local-news headline the second it came out . . . almost like you were waiting for it. Almost like it was timed. What could all these right-wing accounts in sync be trying to distract us from . . . 🙄”

https://twitter.com/JSim07/status/1096217364394209280

Civil-rights activist Johnetta Elzie added, “I can’t believe we’re watching big-name media publications just run with any and every story re: Jussie.”

https://twitter.com/Nettaaaaaaaa/status/1096212914070061058

This morning, on Good Morning America, Smollett explained why he hesitated in reporting the incident.

“There’s a level of pride there,” he explained. “We live in a society where as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.” Asked what he thinks people need to hear right now, Smollett continued, “I think what people need to hear is just the truth.”

Attorney Michael Avenatti said Thursday he has given Chicago prosecutors new video evidence of R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Avenatti said the video isn't the same evidence used in Kelly's 2008 trial, when he was acquitted on child pornography charges. CNN reported the nearly 45-minute VHS tape shows a man appearing to be Kelly performing sex acts with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old.

Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, wouldn't confirm or deny the office is investigating.

Kelly and his attorney have for years denied allegations of sexual misconduct involving women and underage girls. His attorney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the latest allegations.

Avenatti is best known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump. He said his office was retained in April 2018 by multiple people regarding allegations of sexual assault of minors by Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Kelly.

Avenatti said the video surfaced during a 10-month investigation that included witness interviews and examination of documents and evidence throughout the U.S. He told The Associated Press the person who provided the tape knew both Kelly and the female in the video. He also said he didn't know where the person had kept the video or why they hadn't provided it to law enforcement previously.

Foxx asked potential victims to come forward last month after Lifetime aired the documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which revisited the allegations against Kelly and put a spotlight on new ones.

Stars sign get-well card for RBG

Steven Spielberg, Lady Gaga, Spike Lee and Glenn Close have a message for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Get well soon.

They and three dozen Hollywood A-listers, from Bradley Cooper to Quincy Jones, have signed a card that's being overnighted to Ginsburg on Thursday. The 85-year-old Ginsburg has missed a month of Supreme Court arguments as she recovers from the lung cancer surgery she had in December.

In the card, Lee refers to Ginsburg as the ""Judge of Brooklyn."" Regina King wrote that she is the true, ""Super Diva"" in reference to a shirt Ginsburg wears in the documentary ""RBG."" Laura Dern wrote, ""You are our grand reminder to use voice + fight for truth.""

Director Barry Jenkins even stopped to do a plank in honor of Ginsburg's famed workouts after signing.

Prince Philip won't be charged in crash

British prosecutors say Prince Philip won't face charges in connection with a car collision that left two women injured.

The decision came just days after Buckingham Palace said the 97-year-old royal would stop driving. Prosecutors said Thursday they had decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute in regard to the Jan. 17 crash.

Chris Long of the Crown Prosecution Service said prosecutors ""took into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving license.""

""Empire"" actor angered by doubters

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has responded to critics who question his report about being attacked in downtown Chicago last month, saying it was ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie.

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck while he was walking outside around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News that he left the rope and clothes on when police arrived ""because I wanted them to see."" He said he's heard various stories about people questioning the attack, which he said occurred while he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

The singer and actor said the attackers also yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some media outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

No arrests have been made. Police said they've not found surveillance video that shows the attack but that the investigation is ongoing.

Commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu spoke to reporters a little over five hours before polls were supposed to open in Africa’s most populous country and largest democracy.

The commission promised more details at a 2 p.m. briefing in the capital, Abuja.

Yakubu said that “this was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy.”

In 2015, Nigeria delayed the election by six weeks over insecurity.

The Latest: Chicago police release men held in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.”

Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck.

TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE-MANAFORT

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges.

That’s according to a court filing Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office that lays out how federal probation officials have calculated Manafort’s potential sentence.

The recommended sentence under federal guidelines would be the lengthiest prison term imposed in the Russia investigation if a federal judge agreed to it. It would also place the 69-year-old Manafort at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison.

Mueller’s office doesn’t recommend a specific sentence, but says it agrees with the calculation that Manafort should spend between 235 months and 293 months in prison. Manafort also faces having to pay more than $24 million in restitution.

R KELLY-INVESTIGATIONS

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Gloria Allred tells The Associated Press she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

The Los Angeles-based lawyer said by phone Friday she has “made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction” than Chicago aware of her concerns. Allred represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven’t come forward publicly.

Allred says if her client is on the video, “we will do everything legally possible to protect her and her rights.”

Another attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Thursday he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

Kelly has been dogged for years with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred’s comments were “speculative.”

KAEPERNICK/REID SETTLEMENT

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion lawsuits with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) — Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid have settled collusion lawsuits against the NFL.

In a three-sentence statement released Friday, the NFL said:

“For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL. As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

Kaepernick’s lawyer tweeted an identical statement.

Kaepernick and Reid filed collusion grievances against the league, saying they were blacklisted because of protests during the national anthem at games. Kaepernick has not played in the league since 2016, while Reid missed three games last season before signing with Carolina.

PAYLESS-UNRAVELING

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) — Paylesss ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have been shuttered in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

OSCARS-UNTELEVISED CATEGORIES

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) — Following an outcry from many of the movie industry’s most prominent figures, the Academy of Motion Pictures has reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast.

The film academy on Friday said all 24 categories will be shown live, after all. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

Criticism of the move was fiercely contested by many nominees to this year’s Academy Awards, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron. The American Society of Cinematographers issued an open-letter, signed by Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and others, calling the academy’s plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

The Latest: Flood warning for California river cancelled

GUERNEVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Authorities have cancelled a flood warning for a Northern California community where a river fed by a fierce storm rose above flood stage.

The National Weather Service issued the warning for an area near Guerneville (GERN’-vil), north of San Francisco, after the Russian River rose above 32 feet Thursday night.

Some streets in the wine country town were flooded, but residents are used to inundations. One man used a kayak to paddle through a flooded resort.

By Friday evening, however, the storm had receded along with the river and the flood warning was cancelled.

TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE-STONE

Judge issues gag order in case of Trump confidant Stone

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has issued a gag order in the criminal case of Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Friday ordered both sides to refrain from making statements to the media or the public that could prejudice the case.

Stone, 66, is charged with lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that released material stolen from Democratic groups including Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

The charges came out of the special counsel’s probe into Russian meddling in the election.

The judge said the order was necessary to ensure Stone’s right to a fair trial and “to maintain the dignity and seriousness of the courthouse and these proceedings.”

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

″(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — A month into Venezuela’s high-stakes political crisis, President Nicolas Maduro revealed in an AP interview that his government was in secret talks with the Trump administration and predicted he would survive an unprecedented global campaign to force his resignation.

While harshly criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump’s confrontational stance toward his socialist government, Maduro said Thursday that he holds out hope of meeting the U.S. president soon to resolve a crisis over America’s recognition of opponent Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader.

Maduro said that during the secret meetings in New York, his foreign minister invited the Washington, D.C.-based envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, to come to visit “privately, publicly or secretly.”

“If he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I’ll be there,” Maduro said without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours.

A senior administration official in Washington who was not authorized to speak publicly said U.S. officials were willing to meet with “former Venezuela officials, including Maduro himself, to discuss their exit plans.”

Congress OKs border deal; Trump will sign, declare emergency

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress lopsidedly approved a border security compromise Thursday that would avert a second painful government shutdown, but a new confrontation was ignited — this time over President Donald Trump’s plan to bypass lawmakers and declare a national emergency to siphon billions from other federal coffers for his wall on the Mexican boundary.

Money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the 200-plus miles he wanted. The White House said he’d sign the legislation but act unilaterally to get more, prompting condemnations from Democrats and threats of lawsuits from states and others who might lose federal money or said Trump was abusing his authority.

The uproar over Trump’s next move cast an uncertain shadow over what had been a rare display of bipartisanship to address the grinding battle between the White House and lawmakers over border security.

The Senate passed the legislation 83-16, with both parties solidly aboard. The House followed with a 300-128 tally, with Trump’s signature planned Friday. Trump will speak Friday morning in the Rose Garden about border security, the White House said.

Trump is expected to announce that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers — combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including a national emergency, said a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The money is expected to come from funds targeted for military construction and counterdrug efforts.

White House scrambles to find pots of money to use for wall

WASHINGTON (AP) — If President Donald Trump declares an emergency to build the wall with Mexico, he still needs money to pay for it. And shifting money from other accounts to deliver the $5.7 billion he wants is not without political problems.

The administration has been eyeing several pots of money — including disaster funds, counternarcotic accounts and military construction dollars — to fund Trump’s wall, according to congressional aides and White House officials.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said there are various accounts available.

One possibility is shifting a portion of the $13 billion in disaster aid Congress approved last year for Puerto Rico and a dozen states, including California and Texas, hit hard by hurricanes, flooding and other disasters. The money funds Army Corps projects, and the Puerto Rico aid alone totals more than $2 billion.

But Texas lawmakers revolted over White House plans to tap Hurricane Harvey funds, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday they won assurances from the White House that the money won’t be used for the wall.

Amazon dumps NYC headquarters and its promised 25,000 jobs

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city, reversing course after politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised to what is already one of the world’s richest, most powerful companies.

“We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion — we love New York,” the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.

The stunning move was a serious blow to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project, competing against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a bidding war the company stoked.

Cuomo lashed out at fellow New York politicians over Amazon’s change of heart, saying the project would have helped diversify the city’s economy, cement its status as an emerging tech hub and generate money for schools, housing and transit.

“A small group (of) politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,” he said.

Trump Org scraps plans for 2 hotel chains, blaming politics

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s company is scrapping plans for two new hotel chains announced two years ago, casting blame in part on a hostile political environment.

The Trump Organization said Thursday that it will no longer try to open hotels under its Scion and American Idea brands catering to budget and mid-priced travellers, a departure from its focus on luxury hotels. The announcement comes as the company has posted losses at a few of its golf properties and brand experts say it has lost some of its appeal.

“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” the president’s son, Eric Trump, said in an emailed statement. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”

The rollout began with promises of fast success. The company said in March 2017 that nearly two dozen developers had already signed letters of intent to open mid-priced Scion hotels, and was enthusiastic about the future prospects.

“It’s full steam ahead,” said Eric Danziger, who oversees the hotel business for the family. “It’s in our DNA.”

Avenatti says he has new video evidence against R. Kelly

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Michael Avenatti said Thursday that he has given Chicago prosecutors new video evidence of R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Avenatti said the video is not the same evidence used in Kelly’s 2008 trial, when he was acquitted on child pornography charges. CNN, which said it had viewed the footage, reported that the nearly 45-minute VHS tape shows a man who appears to be Kelly performing sex acts with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old.

Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, would not confirm or deny that the office is investigating.

Kelly and his attorney have for years denied allegations of sexual misconduct involving women and underage girls. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the latest allegations.

Avenatti is best known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump. He said his office was retained in April 2018 by multiple people regarding allegations of sexual assault of minors by Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Kelly.

Oregon official: texts show police-extremist collusion

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A member of Portland’s city council said Thursday a newspaper’s report that the commander for the police rapid response team exchanged friendly text messages with a leader of far-right protests that have rocked the city confirms collusion exists between some police and right-wing extremists.

“I am not shocked, and I am not surprised at today’s reporting of Lt. Jeff Niiya’s collaboration with Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson over text to provide aid and support for their hate marches,” Councilwoman Jo Ann Hardesty said in a statement.

Willamette Week obtained text messages through a public records request between Niiya and Gibson. The texts purportedly show Niiya had a friendly rapport with Gibson, frequently discussing Gibson’s plans to demonstrate.

In one text reported by the newspaper, Niiya tells Gibson that he doesn’t see a need to arrest his assistant, Tusitala Toese, who often brawls with antifascist protesters, even if he has a warrant, unless Toese commits a new crime.

“Just make sure he doesn’t do anything which may draw our attention,” Niiya texted Gibson on Dec. 9, 2017, Willamette Week reported. “If he still has the warrant in the system (I don’t run you guys so I don’t personally know) the officers could arrest him. I don’t see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.”

Deadly blue ‘Mexican oxy’ pills take toll on US Southwest

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Aaron Francisco Chavez swallowed at least one of the sky blue pills at a Halloween party before falling asleep forever. He became yet another victim killed by a flood of illicit fentanyl smuggled from Mexico by the Sinaloa cartel into the Southwest — a profitable new business for the drug gang that has made the synthetic opioid responsible for the most fatal overdoses in the U.S.

Three others at the party in Tucson also took the pills nicknamed “Mexican oxy.” They were saved after partygoers flagged down police who administered naloxone overdose reversal medication. The treatment came too late for the 19-year-old Chavez.

The pills vary widely in strength, from a tiny amount to enough to cause lethal overdoses. Law enforcement officials say they have become a lucrative new product for the cartel, despite the conviction this week of Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera in New York.

The four Tucson partiers thought they were taking oxycodone, a much less powerful opioid, investigators believe. The death of Chavez and many others, officials said, illustrate how Arizona and other southwestern states bordering Mexico have become a hot spot in the nation’s fentanyl crisis. Fentanyl deaths tripled in Arizona from 2015 through 2017.

“It’s the worst I’ve seen in 30 years, this toll that it’s taken on families,” said Doug Coleman, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Arizona. “The crack (cocaine) crisis was not as bad.”

After shooting: ‘You can’t really trust other students’

OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) — Some students have difficulty trusting classmates outside their circle. Parents say interactions with school staff are more impersonal. Teachers worry that added security detracts from learning.

The Parkland massacre a year ago upended school life across Florida. In the year since a gunman fatally shot 14 students and three staffers, school districts have reshaped the K-12 experience, adopting new rules for entering campus, hiring more police and holding frequent safety drills. Some districts trained teams of armed employees to confront attackers.

“You can’t really trust other students. They all have different mindsets,” said Allen White, a senior at the lone high school in the central Florida farming town of Okeechobee.

Reflecting at a skate park near campus, White and four friends said their school’s atmosphere changed after Feb. 14, 2018. Only last month, suspicious social media posts put Okeechobee High on alert, prompting many students, including White, to stay home.

“I don’t really feel safe. It has become a real-life epidemic,” he said. He attributed school violence primarily to bullying and mental health and said schools need to better address those issues.

Chicago police, Fox dispute reports about Smollett attack

It’s been roughly 12 hours since the last time we wrote about the racist and homophobic attack launched against Empire star Jussie Smollett on the streets of Chicago last month—i.e., just long enough for this entire story to get thoroughly buried in a wave of confusion, misinformation, and increasingly high-volume competing accounts. That being said, it’s presumably worth at least a bit of our collective time to try to figure out a basic timeline about how this whole clusterfuck went down, so let’s dive in.



Advertisement

To start: As we previously reported, Smollett went on Good Morning, America this morning to talk about the attack—and especially to address those people who refuse to believe that a couple of guys in Chicago might choose to try to kick the ass of a black, openly gay actor who’s made public, negative statements about Donald Trump. These accusations have been swirling around the incident since it was first reported, although it’s never been entirely clear why this particular altercation was thought to be the linchpin of some kind of false flag anti-MAGA master plan.

Advertisement

Zooming out a bit, we learn that, right around the time of Smollett’s interview, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department had made a statement on Twitter, announcing that two “persons of interest” had been identified as having been in the area of the attack. The spokesperson also confirmed that the two men had been picked up for questioning. The Chicago PD has repeatedly refused to classify these two men, who they’ve been reportedly questioning throughout the day, as suspects.

Fast forward to about three hours ago, when Chicago’s local media personalities began to get what we can only describe as “professionally thirsty” in regards to this case. Chicago’s ABC7—and specifically, the Twitter account of anchor Rob Elgas—began reporting on developments in Smollett’s attack, starting by tweeting out an update that the two men picked up by Chicago PD had previously appeared as extras on Empire. (This was later co-signed by their rivals at CBS Chicago, who say that they talked to the men’s attorney, who confirmed it.) Elgas followed that up with an assertion—which also ended up in ABC7's reporting, and in the CBS Chicago report—that Chicago PD detectives were now investigating whether Smollett had staged the attack, with ABC7 going so far as to state that it was “because Smollett was being written off of Empire.” All of this was attributed to “multiple,” but unnamed, sources.

Advertisement

At this point, multiple voices start chiming in to call bullshit, even as ABC7's report and the other local news allegations began to spread online. A spokesperson for the Chicago PD responded to the case on Twitter, stating that “media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed,” and calling ABC7's sources “uninformed and inaccurate.” Fox and the Empire writers’ room Twitter account both loudly denied that there was any intention of writing Smollett’s character off the show. And Smollett’s representation made it clear that, contrary to Elgas and his team’s initial reporting, Smollett had, in fact, responded to questions from police about the attack earlier today.

Advertisement

Per those same news reports, the CPD can hold the two persons of interest without charging them with anything until tomorrow night. On the one hand, the organization is being publicly very careful not to piss people off by attempting to victim-blame Smollett, or even worse, accuse him of running some kind of hoax. (Police superintendent Eddie Johnson even reportedly called ABC7 to make it clear that Smollett is “considered a victim” in the case.) On the other hand, it seems unlikely that two local news teams would go this far out on a limb without someone in the CPD saying something fairly inflammatory in an off-the-record sense. Smollett, meanwhile, has never really wavered in reporting the details of what happened to him, while his network seems extremely determined to make it clear that his alleged “motive” for faking an attack doesn’t actually exist.

So, yeah, like we said: Clusterfuck."

Gunman kills 5 people, wounds 5 police at Illinois business

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — An employee of a manufacturing company opened fire in its suburban Chicago plant Friday, killing five people and wounding five police officers before he was fatally shot, police said.

Aurora, Illinois, Police Chief Kristen Ziman identified the gunman as 45-year-old Gary Martin and said he was believed to be an employee at the Henry Pratt Co. — which makes valves for industrial purposes — in the city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago. She told a news conference that officers arrived within four minutes of receiving reports of the shooting and were fired upon as soon as they entered the 29,000-square-foot manufacturing warehouse.

Police said they did not know the gunman’s motive.

“May God bless the brave law enforcement officers who continue to run toward danger,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at the news conference.

Hospitals reported treating at least seven patients from the shooting, though their conditions weren’t released. Two of the officers were airlifted to trauma centers in Chicago, Ziman said. She said a sixth officer suffered a knee injury. Officials did not say the total number of people injured including police and civilians.

Trump declaration faces uncertain fate in coming court fight

WASHINGTON (AP) — Let the lawsuits begin.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border Friday and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.

That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump’s declaration that the “current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.”

Nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to “bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defense from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.”

Nigeria delays election until Feb. 23 over ‘challenges’

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria’s electoral commission delayed the presidential election until Feb. 23, making the announcement a mere five hours before polls were set to open Saturday. It cited unspecified “challenges” amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country.

Residents of Africa’s most populous nation and largest democracy will soon wake up to outrage. Many had relocated for the chance to vote.

“This was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,” commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. He said more details would be released during an afternoon briefing.

A review of logistics, along with the determination to hold a credible vote, led the commission to conclude that going ahead with the election as planned was “no longer feasible,” he said.

Nigeria also postponed the previous presidential election in 2015 because of deadly insecurity in the northeast, which remains under threat from Islamic extremists.

Chicago police release 2 men questioned in Smollett case

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and said they have new evidence to investigate as a result of questioning them.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

Court filing: Manafort faces more than 19 years in prison

WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, could spend more than 19 years in prison on tax and bank fraud charges, prosecutors said Friday.

Court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office reveal that Manafort faces possibly the lengthiest prison term in the Russia investigation. The 69-year-old Manafort is also at serious risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if a federal judge imposes a sentence within federal guidelines.

The potential sentence stems from Manafort’s conviction last year on eight felony counts related to an elaborate scheme to conceal from tax authorities the millions of dollars he earned overseas from Ukrainian political consulting. It is one of two criminal cases pending against Manafort in which he faces prison time.

Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign for months during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not charged with any crimes directly related to Russian election interference, the thrust of Mueller’s probe. But prosecutors have recently revealed that they remain deeply interested in his contacts during and after the campaign with an associate the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.

In a 27-page court filing Friday, prosecutors did not recommend a precise sentence for Manafort, but they agreed with a calculation by federal probation officials that his crimes deserve a punishment of between 19.5 and 24.5 years. They also lay out in great detail for U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III how they say Manafort’s greed drove him to disregard American law.

APNewsBreak: Allred contacted authorities about R Kelly tape

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Gloria Allred told The Associated Press Friday she has contacted law enforcement about concerns one of her clients may be the person in a VHS tape recently given to Chicago prosecutors that purportedly shows R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Allred, who represents multiple R. Kelly accusers, some of whom haven’t come forward publicly, spoke a day after attorney Michael Avenatti said he gave Chicago prosecutors the video.

“I’ve made law enforcement in a different jurisdiction (other than Chicago) aware of my concerns that it may, in fact, be my client and I want to protect her privacy,” Allred told the AP in a telephone interview.

Kelly has been dogged for decades with allegations of sexual misconduct. Through his lawyers, he has consistently denied them. His current attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the AP Allred’s comments were “speculative.”

Greenberg also said he wasn’t aware of any moves afoot to charge Kelly with anything.

Kaepernick, Eric Reid settle collusion grievances with NFL

NEW YORK (AP) — With a public hearing looming and the threat of owners and league officials facing depositions, the NFL settled collusion cases brought by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid.

The league, about to celebrate its 100th season, faced criticism from all sides thanks to the protest movement started by Kaepernick. Many Kaepernick supporters wanted to see him back on the field, while other fans said they wouldn’t watch if the league allowed players to protest during the national anthem.

The league and Kaepernick’s lawyer sent out statements Friday saying that “the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances” and that a confidentiality agreement would prevent either side from commenting further.

It remains unclear if the NFL admitted wrongdoing or how much money Reid, Kaepernick or others may have received. Considering the lost salary both players claimed and legal costs, the settlement could have climbed into the tens of millions of dollars.

“For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,” the league statement said. “As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.”

Payless ShoeSource to shutter all of its remaining US stores

NEW YORK (AP) — Payless ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have closed down in the last year.

The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All of the stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.

The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

At the time, it had over 4,400 stores in more than 30 countries. It remerged from restructuring four months later with about 3,500 stores and eliminated more than $435 million in debt.

The company said in an email that the liquidation doesn’t affect its franchise operations or its Latin American stores, which remain open for business as usual. It lists 18,000 employees worldwide.

Academy reverses plans, will air all awards live at Oscars

NEW YORK (AP) — Bowing to a backlash that had threatened to engulf an already blunder-plagued Academy Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Friday reversed its decision to present four awards during the commercial breaks of this year’s Oscar broadcast.

All 24 categories will be shown live, after all, at the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, the academy announced in a statement. On Monday, the academy had said that the winning speeches for cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short would be aired in a shortened, taped segment during the broadcast.

“Nine days until the showtime, still tweaking the script” the Academy tweeted Friday.

The academy did not address whether the change meant extending the show’s length, which organizers have said would be reduced to three hours.

The academy’s move to strike awards from the live broadcast was fiercely contested by many of this year’s Oscar nominees, including “Roma” director Alfonso Cuaron and “BlacKkKlansman” filmmaker Spike Lee. The American Society of Cinematographers on Wednesday issued an open-letter to the academy, signed by Martin Scorsese, Brad Pitt and others, calling the plans an insult to the cinematic arts.

Snow too thick to plow keeps skiers from California resorts

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Winter weather enveloping California’s mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.

Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometers) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.

I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Thursday evening.

Chains were required for travel in many other parts of the towering Sierra Nevada.

“All avid skiers are itching to get out on the mountain, but the roads are pretty treacherous right now,” said Kevin Cooper, marketing director for Lake Tahoe TV.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — A month into Venezuela’s high-stakes political crisis, President Nicolas Maduro revealed in an AP interview that his government was in secret talks with the Trump administration and predicted he would survive an unprecedented global campaign to force his resignation.

While harshly criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump’s confrontational stance toward his socialist government, Maduro said Thursday that he holds out hope of meeting the U.S. president soon to resolve a crisis over America’s recognition of opponent Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader.

Maduro said that during the secret meetings in New York, his foreign minister invited the Washington, D.C.-based envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, to come to visit “privately, publicly or secretly.”

“If he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I’ll be there,” Maduro said without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours.

A senior administration official in Washington who was not authorized to speak publicly said U.S. officials were willing to meet with “former Venezuela officials, including Maduro himself, to discuss their exit plans.”

Congress OKs border deal; Trump will sign, declare emergency

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress lopsidedly approved a border security compromise Thursday that would avert a second painful government shutdown, but a new confrontation was ignited — this time over President Donald Trump’s plan to bypass lawmakers and declare a national emergency to siphon billions from other federal coffers for his wall on the Mexican boundary.

Money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the 200-plus miles he wanted. The White House said he’d sign the legislation but act unilaterally to get more, prompting condemnations from Democrats and threats of lawsuits from states and others who might lose federal money or said Trump was abusing his authority.

The uproar over Trump’s next move cast an uncertain shadow over what had been a rare display of bipartisanship to address the grinding battle between the White House and lawmakers over border security.

The Senate passed the legislation 83-16, with both parties solidly aboard. The House followed with a 300-128 tally, with Trump’s signature planned Friday. Trump will speak Friday morning in the Rose Garden about border security, the White House said.

Trump is expected to announce that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers — combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including a national emergency, said a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The money is expected to come from funds targeted for military construction and counterdrug efforts.

White House scrambles to find pots of money to use for wall

WASHINGTON (AP) — If President Donald Trump declares an emergency to build the wall with Mexico, he still needs money to pay for it. And shifting money from other accounts to deliver the $5.7 billion he wants is not without political problems.

The administration has been eyeing several pots of money — including disaster funds, counternarcotic accounts and military construction dollars — to fund Trump’s wall, according to congressional aides and White House officials.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said there are various accounts available.

One possibility is shifting a portion of the $13 billion in disaster aid Congress approved last year for Puerto Rico and a dozen states, including California and Texas, hit hard by hurricanes, flooding and other disasters. The money funds Army Corps projects, and the Puerto Rico aid alone totals more than $2 billion.

But Texas lawmakers revolted over White House plans to tap Hurricane Harvey funds, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday they won assurances from the White House that the money won’t be used for the wall.

Amazon dumps NYC headquarters and its promised 25,000 jobs

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city, reversing course after politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised to what is already one of the world’s richest, most powerful companies.

“We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion — we love New York,” the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.

The stunning move was a serious blow to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project, competing against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a bidding war the company stoked.

Cuomo lashed out at fellow New York politicians over Amazon’s change of heart, saying the project would have helped diversify the city’s economy, cement its status as an emerging tech hub and generate money for schools, housing and transit.

“A small group (of) politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,” he said.

Trump Org scraps plans for 2 hotel chains, blaming politics

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s company is scrapping plans for two new hotel chains announced two years ago, casting blame in part on a hostile political environment.

The Trump Organization said Thursday that it will no longer try to open hotels under its Scion and American Idea brands catering to budget and mid-priced travellers, a departure from its focus on luxury hotels. The announcement comes as the company has posted losses at a few of its golf properties and brand experts say it has lost some of its appeal.

“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” the president’s son, Eric Trump, said in an emailed statement. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”

The rollout began with promises of fast success. The company said in March 2017 that nearly two dozen developers had already signed letters of intent to open mid-priced Scion hotels, and was enthusiastic about the future prospects.

“It’s full steam ahead,” said Eric Danziger, who oversees the hotel business for the family. “It’s in our DNA.”

Avenatti says he has new video evidence against R. Kelly

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Michael Avenatti said Thursday that he has given Chicago prosecutors new video evidence of R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Avenatti said the video is not the same evidence used in Kelly’s 2008 trial, when he was acquitted on child pornography charges. CNN, which said it had viewed the footage, reported that the nearly 45-minute VHS tape shows a man who appears to be Kelly performing sex acts with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old.

Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, would not confirm or deny that the office is investigating.

Kelly and his attorney have for years denied allegations of sexual misconduct involving women and underage girls. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the latest allegations.

Avenatti is best known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump. He said his office was retained in April 2018 by multiple people regarding allegations of sexual assault of minors by Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Kelly.

Oregon official: texts show police-extremist collusion

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A member of Portland’s city council said Thursday a newspaper’s report that the commander for the police rapid response team exchanged friendly text messages with a leader of far-right protests that have rocked the city confirms collusion exists between some police and right-wing extremists.

“I am not shocked, and I am not surprised at today’s reporting of Lt. Jeff Niiya’s collaboration with Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson over text to provide aid and support for their hate marches,” Councilwoman Jo Ann Hardesty said in a statement.

Willamette Week obtained text messages through a public records request between Niiya and Gibson. The texts purportedly show Niiya had a friendly rapport with Gibson, frequently discussing Gibson’s plans to demonstrate.

In one text reported by the newspaper, Niiya tells Gibson that he doesn’t see a need to arrest his assistant, Tusitala Toese, who often brawls with antifascist protesters, even if he has a warrant, unless Toese commits a new crime.

“Just make sure he doesn’t do anything which may draw our attention,” Niiya texted Gibson on Dec. 9, 2017, Willamette Week reported. “If he still has the warrant in the system (I don’t run you guys so I don’t personally know) the officers could arrest him. I don’t see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.”

Deadly blue ‘Mexican oxy’ pills take toll on US Southwest

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Aaron Francisco Chavez swallowed at least one of the sky blue pills at a Halloween party before falling asleep forever. He became yet another victim killed by a flood of illicit fentanyl smuggled from Mexico by the Sinaloa cartel into the Southwest — a profitable new business for the drug gang that has made the synthetic opioid responsible for the most fatal overdoses in the U.S.

Three others at the party in Tucson also took the pills nicknamed “Mexican oxy.” They were saved after partygoers flagged down police who administered naloxone overdose reversal medication. The treatment came too late for the 19-year-old Chavez.

The pills vary widely in strength, from a tiny amount to enough to cause lethal overdoses. Law enforcement officials say they have become a lucrative new product for the cartel, despite the conviction this week of Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera in New York.

The four Tucson partiers thought they were taking oxycodone, a much less powerful opioid, investigators believe. The death of Chavez and many others, officials said, illustrate how Arizona and other southwestern states bordering Mexico have become a hot spot in the nation’s fentanyl crisis. Fentanyl deaths tripled in Arizona from 2015 through 2017.

“It’s the worst I’ve seen in 30 years, this toll that it’s taken on families,” said Doug Coleman, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Arizona. “The crack (cocaine) crisis was not as bad.”

After shooting: ‘You can’t really trust other students’

OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) — Some students have difficulty trusting classmates outside their circle. Parents say interactions with school staff are more impersonal. Teachers worry that added security detracts from learning.

The Parkland massacre a year ago upended school life across Florida. In the year since a gunman fatally shot 14 students and three staffers, school districts have reshaped the K-12 experience, adopting new rules for entering campus, hiring more police and holding frequent safety drills. Some districts trained teams of armed employees to confront attackers.

“You can’t really trust other students. They all have different mindsets,” said Allen White, a senior at the lone high school in the central Florida farming town of Okeechobee.

Reflecting at a skate park near campus, White and four friends said their school’s atmosphere changed after Feb. 14, 2018. Only last month, suspicious social media posts put Okeechobee High on alert, prompting many students, including White, to stay home.

“I don’t really feel safe. It has become a real-life epidemic,” he said. He attributed school violence primarily to bullying and mental health and said schools need to better address those issues.

Chicago police, Fox dispute reports about Smollett attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said there was no evidence to support a report by Chicago ABC7 television, which cited sources familiar with the investigation.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama “Empire,” told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on Jan. 29.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of “Empire” released a statement saying: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago police are questioning two “persons of interest” who surveillance cameras showed were in the area where Smollett said he was assaulted, Guglielmi said in a tweet on Thursday.

The two men know Smollett from working on “Empire” and were picked up at Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night after returning from Nigeria where they were visiting family, their lawyer told Chicago television station CBS2.

“They do know Jussie, they have worked with him on Empire,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview with CBS2. “They are baffled why they are persons of interest.”

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The names of the two men have not been released and police have not found any video footage of the assault, which they say is being investigated as a hate crime.

“They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi said on Twitter."

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — A month into Venezuela’s high-stakes political crisis, President Nicolas Maduro revealed in an AP interview that his government was in secret talks with the Trump administration and predicted he would survive an unprecedented global campaign to force his resignation.

While harshly criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump’s confrontational stance toward his socialist government, Maduro said Thursday that he holds out hope of meeting the U.S. president soon to resolve a crisis over America’s recognition of opponent Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader.

Maduro said that during the secret meetings in New York, his foreign minister invited the Washington, D.C.-based envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, to come to visit “privately, publicly or secretly.”

“If he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I’ll be there,” Maduro said without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours.

A senior administration official in Washington who was not authorized to speak publicly said U.S. officials were willing to meet with “former Venezuela officials, including Maduro himself, to discuss their exit plans.”

Congress OKs border deal; Trump will sign, declare emergency

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress lopsidedly approved a border security compromise Thursday that would avert a second painful government shutdown, but a new confrontation was ignited — this time over President Donald Trump’s plan to bypass lawmakers and declare a national emergency to siphon billions from other federal coffers for his wall on the Mexican boundary.

Money in the bill for border barriers, about $1.4 billion, is far below the $5.7 billion Trump insisted he needed and would finance just a quarter of the 200-plus miles he wanted. The White House said he’d sign the legislation but act unilaterally to get more, prompting condemnations from Democrats and threats of lawsuits from states and others who might lose federal money or said Trump was abusing his authority.

The uproar over Trump’s next move cast an uncertain shadow over what had been a rare display of bipartisanship to address the grinding battle between the White House and lawmakers over border security.

The Senate passed the legislation 83-16, with both parties solidly aboard. The House followed with a 300-128 tally, with Trump’s signature planned Friday. Trump will speak Friday morning in the Rose Garden about border security, the White House said.

Trump is expected to announce that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers — combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including a national emergency, said a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The money is expected to come from funds targeted for military construction and counterdrug efforts.

White House scrambles to find pots of money to use for wall

WASHINGTON (AP) — If President Donald Trump declares an emergency to build the wall with Mexico, he still needs money to pay for it. And shifting money from other accounts to deliver the $5.7 billion he wants is not without political problems.

The administration has been eyeing several pots of money — including disaster funds, counternarcotic accounts and military construction dollars — to fund Trump’s wall, according to congressional aides and White House officials.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said there are various accounts available.

One possibility is shifting a portion of the $13 billion in disaster aid Congress approved last year for Puerto Rico and a dozen states, including California and Texas, hit hard by hurricanes, flooding and other disasters. The money funds Army Corps projects, and the Puerto Rico aid alone totals more than $2 billion.

But Texas lawmakers revolted over White House plans to tap Hurricane Harvey funds, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday they won assurances from the White House that the money won’t be used for the wall.

Amazon dumps NYC headquarters and its promised 25,000 jobs

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city, reversing course after politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised to what is already one of the world’s richest, most powerful companies.

“We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion — we love New York,” the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.

The stunning move was a serious blow to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project, competing against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a bidding war the company stoked.

Cuomo lashed out at fellow New York politicians over Amazon’s change of heart, saying the project would have helped diversify the city’s economy, cement its status as an emerging tech hub and generate money for schools, housing and transit.

“A small group (of) politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,” he said.

Trump Org scraps plans for 2 hotel chains, blaming politics

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s company is scrapping plans for two new hotel chains announced two years ago, casting blame in part on a hostile political environment.

The Trump Organization said Thursday that it will no longer try to open hotels under its Scion and American Idea brands catering to budget and mid-priced travellers, a departure from its focus on luxury hotels. The announcement comes as the company has posted losses at a few of its golf properties and brand experts say it has lost some of its appeal.

“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” the president’s son, Eric Trump, said in an emailed statement. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”

The rollout began with promises of fast success. The company said in March 2017 that nearly two dozen developers had already signed letters of intent to open mid-priced Scion hotels, and was enthusiastic about the future prospects.

“It’s full steam ahead,” said Eric Danziger, who oversees the hotel business for the family. “It’s in our DNA.”

Avenatti says he has new video evidence against R. Kelly

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorney Michael Avenatti said Thursday that he has given Chicago prosecutors new video evidence of R&B star R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Avenatti said the video is not the same evidence used in Kelly’s 2008 trial, when he was acquitted on child pornography charges. CNN, which said it had viewed the footage, reported that the nearly 45-minute VHS tape shows a man who appears to be Kelly performing sex acts with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old.

Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, would not confirm or deny that the office is investigating.

Kelly and his attorney have for years denied allegations of sexual misconduct involving women and underage girls. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the latest allegations.

Avenatti is best known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump. He said his office was retained in April 2018 by multiple people regarding allegations of sexual assault of minors by Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Kelly.

Oregon official: texts show police-extremist collusion

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A member of Portland’s city council said Thursday a newspaper’s report that the commander for the police rapid response team exchanged friendly text messages with a leader of far-right protests that have rocked the city confirms collusion exists between some police and right-wing extremists.

“I am not shocked, and I am not surprised at today’s reporting of Lt. Jeff Niiya’s collaboration with Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson over text to provide aid and support for their hate marches,” Councilwoman Jo Ann Hardesty said in a statement.

Willamette Week obtained text messages through a public records request between Niiya and Gibson. The texts purportedly show Niiya had a friendly rapport with Gibson, frequently discussing Gibson’s plans to demonstrate.

In one text reported by the newspaper, Niiya tells Gibson that he doesn’t see a need to arrest his assistant, Tusitala Toese, who often brawls with antifascist protesters, even if he has a warrant, unless Toese commits a new crime.

“Just make sure he doesn’t do anything which may draw our attention,” Niiya texted Gibson on Dec. 9, 2017, Willamette Week reported. “If he still has the warrant in the system (I don’t run you guys so I don’t personally know) the officers could arrest him. I don’t see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.”

Deadly blue ‘Mexican oxy’ pills take toll on US Southwest

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Aaron Francisco Chavez swallowed at least one of the sky blue pills at a Halloween party before falling asleep forever. He became yet another victim killed by a flood of illicit fentanyl smuggled from Mexico by the Sinaloa cartel into the Southwest — a profitable new business for the drug gang that has made the synthetic opioid responsible for the most fatal overdoses in the U.S.

Three others at the party in Tucson also took the pills nicknamed “Mexican oxy.” They were saved after partygoers flagged down police who administered naloxone overdose reversal medication. The treatment came too late for the 19-year-old Chavez.

The pills vary widely in strength, from a tiny amount to enough to cause lethal overdoses. Law enforcement officials say they have become a lucrative new product for the cartel, despite the conviction this week of Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera in New York.

The four Tucson partiers thought they were taking oxycodone, a much less powerful opioid, investigators believe. The death of Chavez and many others, officials said, illustrate how Arizona and other southwestern states bordering Mexico have become a hot spot in the nation’s fentanyl crisis. Fentanyl deaths tripled in Arizona from 2015 through 2017.

“It’s the worst I’ve seen in 30 years, this toll that it’s taken on families,” said Doug Coleman, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Arizona. “The crack (cocaine) crisis was not as bad.”

After shooting: ‘You can’t really trust other students’

OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) — Some students have difficulty trusting classmates outside their circle. Parents say interactions with school staff are more impersonal. Teachers worry that added security detracts from learning.

The Parkland massacre a year ago upended school life across Florida. In the year since a gunman fatally shot 14 students and three staffers, school districts have reshaped the K-12 experience, adopting new rules for entering campus, hiring more police and holding frequent safety drills. Some districts trained teams of armed employees to confront attackers.

“You can’t really trust other students. They all have different mindsets,” said Allen White, a senior at the lone high school in the central Florida farming town of Okeechobee.

Reflecting at a skate park near campus, White and four friends said their school’s atmosphere changed after Feb. 14, 2018. Only last month, suspicious social media posts put Okeechobee High on alert, prompting many students, including White, to stay home.

“I don’t really feel safe. It has become a real-life epidemic,” he said. He attributed school violence primarily to bullying and mental health and said schools need to better address those issues.

Chicago police, Fox dispute reports about Smollett attack

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

Sources said he did it because his character was being written off the Fox series.

The accusations started when unnamed sources told reporters of two Chicago stations that there’s a possibility that Smollett and the two alleged assailants orchestrated the crime to prevent the actor from getting axed from the show.

“Multiple sources tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack — allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” WLS reporter Rob Elgas wrote on Twitter.

CBS Chicago reporter Charlie De Mar, on the other hand, revealed that the homes of the two alleged attackers were raided Wednesday night. The two were identified to be of Nigerian descent, and they happen to have appeared on Smollett’s show as extras. It was confirmed that the persons of interest know the actor.

In an update, Elgas said that Smollett did not show up for an interview with detectives after news broke about the possibility of the attack being staged. However, in his follow-up, he revealed that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson maintained that the actor is considered “a victim” amid the ongoing investigation.

Elgas has since learned from Smollet’s reps hat he did answer follow-up questions from Chicago police and is still cooperating with the authorities. He also received an official statement from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, saying that they continue to stand behind the actor.

Meanwhile, De Mar gave an update that the attorney of the two suspects in custody, Gloria Schmidt, said that they are expecting charges to be pressed before 5:45 p.m. on Friday since that’s the time when the 48-hour hold will expire.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax are unconfirmed by the detectives handling the case. He added that “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Meanwhile, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis also voiced her thoughts on the matter, saying that Smollett has now been “doubly victimized.” The first one was when he was assaulted, the second one was the “speculation” about him being involved in the planning of the attack.

Smollett was attacked in late-January by two men, who reportedly hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up. The men also reportedly poured what’s believed to be bleach on the actor and tied a noose around his neck before running away. Following the incident, Smollett sought treatment in Chicago where his show was being filmed, according to TV Line."

Chicago police contested media reports on Thursday that officers were investigating whether 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett staged being physically assaulted because he was being written out of the television show.

Smollett, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on the hip-hop drama 'Empire', told police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck on January 29.

In an interview with 'Good Morning America' that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

The 36-year-old made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America this week and said he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" he told the network. ""Never did.""

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, is alleged to have been attacked by men who shouted homophobic and racist abuse in Chicago on January 29.

The 36-year-old made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America this week and said he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack.

Created by Nelson “Moses” Lassiter and shot in a pseudo-documentary style, “Single Record” follows Aaron Hunter (played by Lassiter), an aspiring New York rapper. Aaron spends most of his days peddling homemade CDs to passersby until his rhyming skills are discovered by Kieran Davis (Wilson Christopher), a newly established music executive. (Check out the “Single Record” trailer above.)

When Aaron’s ego impedes his progress in the recording studio, producer Bizzy Beats (Bryan Fitzgerald) enlists another singer-songwriter, Harmon (Kyle Axman), to help create a hit. After a booze-and-drug-filled afternoon, Aaron and Harmon share a woozy kiss that could have lasting implications.

The Philadelphia-born Lassiter told HuffPost he drew on his personal experiences coming to terms with his sexuality for the six-episode series, currently available on the streaming network Dekkoo and debuting on Revry Feb. 1. To keep “Single Record” true to its subject, the show boasts a soundtrack of all-new music, too.

“As a filmmaker and songwriter, I wanted to use my point of view to tell a story that many people can connect with, whether they are LGBTQ or not,” Lassiter said. Noting that Aaron “finds himself grappling with who he is versus what the industry wants him to be,” he added, “The show addresses what could happen to a person when they feel alone and isolated while uncovering [their] truth.”

Given that the “Single Record” will debut days after “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was attacked in an alleged racist and homophobic hate crime, Lassiter is hopeful his show will prompt reviewers to speak out against discrimination of any kind, as well as “reflect on similar experiences in their lives.”

“When people finish the series, I want them to see life through another’s eyes and be fully aware that every action has a consequence that will not only affect you, but everyone else around you,” he said."

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the ""supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

""(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" he told the network. ""Never did.""

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation ."

The report, obviously fabricated, claimed Smollet was upset he was being written out of “Empire.” It didn’t make any sense. But the web picked it up and ran with it.

Now Danny Strong, creator of “Empire,” has weighed in on Twitter. He writes: “There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed.”

Fox TV also chimed in, reminding readers Smollett is a “core” character. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” said 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment today. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

It’s funny that no one wants to believe Smollett. Something DID happen to him, obviously. Time and patience will bear that out."

But recent reporting from ABC7, their local affiliate in Chicago, suggested that Smollett may have collaborated with others to stage the attack because he allegedly was being written off the show.

“Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire,’” reported ABC7. Adding, “Chicago police told ABC News, Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack - or whether the attack happened at all.’”

That 24 minutes and 19 seconds was tallied from ABC’s World News Tonight’s coverage on February 13-14 and February 14's Good Morning America when they were either hyping the interview between Smollett and ABC’s Robin Roberts or showing it. Since the alleged attack first broke on January 29, those two programs had spent a total of 52 minutes and 38 seconds covering Smollett’s claims. An alluring claim was the accusation that the attackers yelled: “this is MAGA country.”

During that time, ABC was sympathetic to Smollett despite swirling questions about the validity of his claims. As NewsBusters news analyst Kristine Marsh discovered, Roberts “did not refer to the attack as ‘alleged’ even once.” And the coverage on World News Tonight wasn’t much better.

During Wednesday’s World News Tonight (February 13), reporter Alex Perez touted how: “Tonight, actor Jussie Smollett is speaking out in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts. For the first time, revealing what he saw in that grainy surveillance image of two people police say were spotted nearby around the time of the attack.”

“The star of the show Empire told Chicago police he was walking back to his downtown apartment when the men assaulted him, battering him in the face, yelling racial and homophobic slurs and putting a noose around his neck. Investigators calling it a possible hate crime,” Perez added.

Perez then played a soundbite of Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson stating: “He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim. He's been very cooperative.” But that soundbite was from February 1. That date was noteworthy, because, on February 13’s NBC Nightly News, they reported that Chicago Police were saying something totally different.

According to NBC correspondent Ron Mott, since the CPD could not find “evidence of an assault and no independent corroborating information,” they “continue to consider Smollett a ‘possible crime victim’, but say he will be held accountable if they suspect the actor filed a false report.”

Sometime after the ABC interview on Thursday (February 14), news broke that the two people featured in a photo circulated by police were actually people Smollett knew and had worked with on Empire. ABC was still quite sympathetic, with Perez reporting:

But police say they have no evidence the two people were involved in the attack on Smollett. Smollett is being interviewed again by investigators. The Empire star now opening up about what happened that night he was on his phone, talking to his manager. (…) [W]e learned just a short time ago, that authorities actually carried out an overnight raid on the home of those two people that they have been interviewing, collecting shoes and electronic devices as evidence. So far, no one has been charged.

Meanwhile, on Thursday’s NBC Nightly News, reporter Miguel Almaguer was more willing to cast doubt on Smollett. “As Smollett begins to make public appearances, questions are swirling over the actor's account of the alleged racist and homophobic attack, still not verified by police. The Chicago Tribune is reporting both men questioned today are black,” he recalled.

Adding, “Detectives say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance video and have not found any evidence of the attack. Investigators call Smollett an ‘alleged victim’ who they still have questions for.”

In yet another twist late Thursday, ABC7 reporter Rob Elgas reported on Twitter that Superintendent Johnson contacted the outlet to say “Smollett is considered a victim,” and a spokesperson for Smollett said the actor had answered: “Routine follow up questions.”

From the beginning, Smollett’s claims were dubious which were evident by the questions many had, NBC included. And as time went on, the claims appeared to get weaker and weaker.

Fox Entertainment have denied claims suggesting Jussie Smollett was going to be ‘written off’ from Empire.

A spokesperson for Fox has issued a statement insisting that the idea is ‘ridiculous’, after reports have been circulating alleging Jussie had ‘staged his attack’ in Chicago in a bid to ‘keep his job’.

Jussie was attacked in Chicago by two masked men, with reports later claiming the two men in question ‘beat the actor up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him’.

He was taken to hospital for treatment and the attack is now being treated as a hate crime, as the attackers allegedly hurled racial and homophobic slurs at Jussie.

It is now being claimed by Chicago-based outlets that Jussie had ‘conspired with his attackers’ before the attack took place.

Denying such claims, Fox have said they ‘stand behind’ the star who plays Jamal Lyon in the series.

Fox insisted Jussie is a ‘core player’ on Empire, dismissing claims he ‘staged’ attack in Chicago to save his job (Picture: Rex)

The statement given to People read: ‘The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous.

‘He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.’

TMZ reports that Jussie is being questioned by Chicago police again, as well as a man, an actor who also appeared on Empire, about the attacks that left Jussie hospitalised last month.

Sources connected to the case told the publication that the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD on Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport.

Actor Jussie has said he is ‘pissed off’ that people are doubting his attack and think details have been ‘fabricated’ (Picture: Invision)

The website reports that Jussie was brought in on Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare is also reported to have been taken in for questioning.

The two individuals are being questioned as ‘persons of interest’.

A rep for Jussie told Metro.co.uk: ‘Jussie answered routine questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to be cooperative.’

Jussie, meanwhile, said he is ‘pissed off’ in his first TV interview since the attack took place.

He appeared on Good Morning America and vented his frustration at those doubting his attack and claiming details of his ordeal have been ‘fabricated’.

‘I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.

‘You know, at first it was a thing of, “Listen if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,” then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

‘And then it became a thing of, like, “Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”‘

""The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement late Friday.

He gave no details of the new evidence.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29 before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack happened.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said she had no comment on the release of the two men Friday.

The two men, identified only as Nigerian brothers, were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. He said he did not know what the man's job was.

Guglielmi also said police searched the Chicago apartment where the men lived. But he said he had no information on what was found.

Police have said they found no surveillance video of an attack but continue to look. Investigators also said they were contacting stores in the hope of finding out who bought the rope that was around Smollett's neck.

But police earlier this week said there was ""no evidence to say that this is a hoax"" and that Smollett ""continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.""

In an interview with ABC News, the singer and actor said he didn't remove the rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

Smollett also said he initially refused to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers. He later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for an investigation."

At a Thursday press conference at the White House, April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, asked the president about the alleged assault, but he offered just a short response.

“That I can tell you is horrible,” he said. “I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

View Trump’s comments on Smollett below.

The president did not address police reports that Smollett, who is gay, told them his attackers shouted “racist and homophobic slurs.” Similarly, he didn’t address the claims that his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” had been cited by the attackers during the assault.

Instead, Trump used the question to delve into a discussion about immigration from Mexico and to make a renewed call for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border.

“What I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we’re allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic and do all of these horrible things,” the president said. “If we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country.”

“That, to me, is the great sin,” he added.

Prior to Thursday, the White House had been criticized for staying silent on Smollett’s attack.

A number of top Democrats ― including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Senator Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden ― had voiced their support for Smollett on social media shortly after the news broke.

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.



This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

Smollett’s representative, Pamela Sharp, has said the actor is “recovering well” after being treated for cuts to his face and neck at Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

He’s slated to return to work Saturday for a previously scheduled concert in Los Angeles."

During his conversation with Robin Roberts, Smollett recapped the traumatic incident and possible hate crime, recalling how his masked attacker used racist and homophobic slurs, punched him, poured bleach on him, and hung a rope around his neck. In the weeks since the disturbing attack and consequent hospitalization, Smollett’s account has been questioned by skeptics—which the actor noted during his G.M.A. sitdown.

“At first it was a thing of like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it—’cause it’s the truth!’” the Empire actor said. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth!’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”

Hours later, in a twist that may have proven Smollet’s point, a local Chicago news outlet reported that police were investigating “whether Smollett and two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of Empire.” Within two hours of ABC7 reporter Rob Elgas posting the claim on Twitter, it had had been retweeted over 5,800 times by users who shared the report with their followers, and so on.

Smollett’s representative swiftly denied the report in an e-mail response to Vanity Fair. “Today, Jussie did answer routine follow-up questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” Pamela Sharp wrote, contradicting ABC7’s report that the actor “failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday.” Sharp added, “There is no evidence to support [ABC7’s report] and Jussie was NOT written off Empire.”

Moments later, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment also issued a statement denying the report.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Chicago Police additionally shot down the local report—with spokesman Anthony Guglielmi releasing a strongly worded clarification on Twitter: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. [Superintendent] Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed C.P.D. sources are uninformed and inaccurate.

Even so, outlets like Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Page Six, and Complex re-reported the story—sending a wave across the Internet that emboldened Smollett’s critics and drew out new skepticism. . “This story has sounded made up since the beginning,” one Twitter user wrote, in a response to Elgas’s breaking report.

Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two “persons of interest” who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren’t considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea “patently ridiculous.”

“(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he told the network. “Never did.”

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were “ridiculous” to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump‘s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing “MAGA” hats were inaccurate.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn’t remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived “because I wanted them to see.”

He also said he didn’t initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

However, not everyone seems to believe the Empire actor’s story.

According to TVLine, Jussie Smollett’s attack story is getting a bit bizarre. The actor was reportedly attacked in Chicago last month when he says that two men wearing masks over their faces yelled out racist and homophobic slurs to him, hit him with their hands, poured a chemical liquid over him, and then tied a rope around his neck.

Jussie claims that the assailants also yelled things such as President Donald Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” during the horrific and terrifying attack.

Now, some speculation is floating around that Smollett staged the attack in an attempt to keep himself from being fired from the TV series, Empire. Of course, Jussie denies any wrongdoing in the situation, and now Fox is speaking out.

Before the attack, there were no rumors that Jussie had been fired from the series, but now the speculation is running wild after police claim that the actor handed over his phone records, which they say were redacted.

The rumors got so out of hand that the network was forced to make a statement, which reveals that Jussie was never fired from the show, and that they continue to support him through this very difficult time in his life.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement this week.

Smollett currently plays the fan favorite role of Jamal Lyon on the network’s musical drama, and viewers would likely be furious to see the character be written off the show.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Jussie opened up about the attack during an interview with Robin Roberts on Thursday’s episode of Good Morning America.

The actor claims that he’s been permanently changed by the attack, and that he’ll never be the same man he was before the terrifying night. He also revealed that he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to fully heal from the hate crime, especially if the people who did this to him are never caught and brought to justice for their actions.

Fans can see more of Jussie Smollett by watching Empire, which airs Wednesday nights on Fox, or by following him on Instagram."

Citing anonymous sources familiar with the investigation, reporters for ABC and CBS affiliates in Chicago initially wrote that the racist and homophobic attack on Smollett in January was being investigated as a hoax perpetrated with the actor's involvement after he discovered he was to be written off the Fox drama.

However, the Chicago Police Department stated it has no evidence to support those media reports. ""We have no evidence to support their reporting, and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" wrote Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi on Twitter.

In a statement to TV Guide, 20th Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, supported Smollett and said there were no plans to write him off the show: ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

A representative for Smollett told TV Guide Thursday evening that the actor is cooperating with the police investigation. In a statement to Essence earlier this month, Smollett said, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ""

Empire airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Fox.

ABC7 Eyewitness News reported Thursday that police were investigating whether Smollett, who is black and gay, had fabricated allegations that two white men attacked him, poured bleach on him, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. One of the suspects also tied a rope around his neck, Smollett said. CBS Chicago also reported, citing anonymous sources, that the attack, which drew nationwide condemnation, may have been staged by Smollett.

A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said law enforcement has “no evidence” to support the ABC7 report and called the news outlet’s anonymous police sources “uninformed and inaccurate.”

The ABC7 report also suggested the “Empire” actor may have staged the attack because he was allegedly being written off the series.

Fox, which owns the series, denied that allegation.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the company said in a statement.

Following the alleged incident, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., blamed President Trump, accusing him of stocking racial tensions.

Trump, too, weighed in on it at the time. “That, I can tell you, is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that's horrible,” the president said last month. “It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.”

The reports Thursday night that the attack was staged drew widespread comment on social media.

According to a local CBS affiliate, officers in Chicago raided a home occupied by two men identified as Nigerian brothers who had roles as extras on “Empire,” the show on which Smollett stars.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, the 35-year-old claimed he was the victim of a violent homophobic attack by two men last month after leaving a Subway restaurant. Days earlier, he alleged that he received a hate-filled letter threatening his life.

Authorities have been following up on leads in the weeks since and a relative of the two men interviewed this week are suspected of possibly working with Smollett to orchestrate the incident.

After searching the home, police reportedly left with evidence including bleach, receipts, shoes and other items. Sources close to the family say the home was left in disarray after investigators searched it.

TMZ cited sources reporting that Smollett himself was interviewed by police on Thursday.

Despite those sources’ claims, however, police remain firm in their assertion that there is no evidence to report showing Smollett was involved in the attack, as reported by the New York Daily News.

The two men reportedly wanted as persons of interest were arrested at O’Hare airport on Wednesday after leaving for Nigeria — on the day of Smollett’s alleged attack — for what they claimed was a family visit.

A statement from the production companies behind “Empire” offered their own statement on the recent updates in the case.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television wrote. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Jussie Smollett claimed to be the victim of an attack in downtown Chicago in January. The Empire actor said that two men in masks beat him, wrapped a rope around his neck, put a chemical on him and called him racial and homophobic slurs. He also said that the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country!”

Now, Chicago police have identified two persons of interest, both of whom are reportedly Nigerian and appeared on Empire as extras.

ABC7 Chicago reports:

Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.” A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday. A source briefed on the Smollett investigation confirmed to ABC News that Chicago police are questioning the two persons of interest — one of whom has appeared on “Empire.”

Mere moments after the ABC report, the Chicago Police Department issued a firm refutation, saying, “Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

“Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” the department’s spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday.

During a tearful interview that aired on Good Morning America Thursday, the 36-year-old actor said that he was “pissed off” at those who didn’t believe his story.

“It’s like, you know, at first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then, that’s it, because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, how can you doubt that?” he said.

“Like, how can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.”"

Despite reports saying Empire actor Jussie Smollett staged his Chicago assault after learning about his writing off from the hit FOX show, the network came out in support of Smollet.

Earlier today, Variety reported that The Chicago Police Department had reason to believe that the attack on Smollett was staged. Two reporters each from ABC 7 and CBS Chicago claimed that the actor was aware that he was being written off from the show, leading him to conspire with the two perpetrators and fake the assault. However, Chicago PD later retracted their statement, claiming that the information was a hoax and “unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi addressed the “staged assault” rumors on Twitter, calling ABC 7’s sources inaccurate. “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi said. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted ABC 7 Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Because of this, FOX voiced its full support for the actor, calling the rumors “patently ridiculous.” In a joint statement from 201th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, the network said, “the idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series, and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett was assaulted at 2 AM on January 29 by two men who shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” while attacking him. They then beat Smollett, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene."

Fox, the network which produces Empire, released a statement to say Smollett was “core” to the show and was not being written out.

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, is alleged to have been attacked by men who shouted homophobic and racist abuse in Chicago on January 29.

The 36-year-old made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America this week and said he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack."

Chicago police said Thursday night that local media reports that the attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the ""supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

""(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" he told the network. ""Never did.""

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing .

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf. Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see.""

He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation."

Chicago police are denying reports that they believe the racist and homophobic attack against Jussie Smollett was staged.

Shortly after reports surfaced that police were questioning two persons of interest in the case, multiple reports claimed police believe the racist and homophobic attack against the actor was staged because his EMPIRE character was being written off the show.

Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman denied the reports on Twitter.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he wrote. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Jussie Smollett Attack: Chicago police have identified 2 ‘persons of interest’

On Thursday, Rob Elgas of ABC 7 in Chicago reported that “multiple sources” alleged Jussie Smollett and staged the incident because his character was being written off of the FOX series, EMPIRE. Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, wrote about a source who said investigators believed the “non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.”

FOX denied the notion that Smollett’s character was being written off of the show and continues to stand behind the actor.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network said in a statement on Thursday. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

“He’s been very cooperative and very consistent,” Smollett’s publicist, Pamela Sharp, said of the “ridiculous rumors.”

Other reports suggested that the two men brought in for questioning were the same ones caught on surveillance tape on January 30.

“Media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time,” Guglielmi said on Thursday.

Jussie Smollett confirmed his belief that the two men caught in the footage were responsible for his attack during an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday morning.

“For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘O.K., we’re getting somewhere,’” he told Robin Roberts. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”"

The Chicago Police Department and 20th Century Fox Television pushed back against a Thursday report from WLS-TV Chicago that said police were looking into whether actor Jussie Smollett staged an attack upon himself while he was walking along a street late at night in Chicago on January 29.

“Media reports about the ‘Empire’ incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” CPD’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweeted statement. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Smollett, an openly gay actor and musician, plays Jamal Joseph Lyon on the television show “Empire.” In its report, WLS-TV claimed that police were investigating whether or not the attack was staged because the actor was being written off the television show.

In a statement sent to INSIDER, Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied that Smollett was being written off the show, calling it “patently ridiculous.”

“He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement continued.

A spokesperson also said that Smollett answered follow-up questions from police on Thursday, countering the WLS-TV report.

Smollett alleged that around 2 a.m. local time, when he was heading to Subway for a sandwich, two white men poured an unknown chemical on him, beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, and yelled racist and homophobic epithets.

The Chicago Police Department is speaking with two persons of interest, Officer Guglielmi tweeted on Thursday.

“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,” he said. “They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

Guglielmi told CBS News that the people of interest were identified by “advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records,” and he told the Associated Press that the people being questioned are those who appeared in surveillance photos released last month. Nobody has been charged in the case.

INSIDER contacted CPD for more information, and we will update as necessary.

Smollett spoke to “Good Morning America” on Thursday, and he addressed those who have cast doubt on the veracity of his allegations.

“I think people need to hear the truth,” he told “GMA.” “‘Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community – young, black children – to know how strong that they are.”

The reports surfaced as detectives were questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance cameras in the area of downtown Chicago where Smollett said he was attacked last month.

The two men aren't considered suspects but may have been in the area when Smollett says he was attacked, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier Thursday. Smollett said two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs before attacking him and putting a rope around his neck early on Jan. 29.

Guglielmi said Thursday night that Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted at least one Chicago news outlet to say investigators have no evidence to support their reporting. The spokesman added that Johnson said the ""supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

Producers of the television drama also disputed media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show, calling the idea ""patently ridiculous.""

""(Smollett) remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement late Thursday.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told ABC News in an interview that aired Thursday morning that he believes the people of interest were the ones who attacked him.

""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them,"" he told the network. ""Never did.""

No arrests have been made in the case. Police said they have not found surveillance video that shows the attack, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Smollett also told Robin Roberts of ABC News that people who question his narrative of the attack were ""ridiculous"" to think he would lie. Smollett has said he was attacked while out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

The singer and actor said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" referencing President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Smollett said earlier reports from some outlets that his attackers were wearing ""MAGA"" hats were inaccurate.

""I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Smollett said he didn't want to call police at first, but that his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, called on his behalf.

Smollett said he didn't remove a rope from around his neck before police arrived ""because I wanted them to see."" He also said he didn't initially want to give police his cellphone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Smollett later gave detectives heavily redacted phone records that police have said are insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The actor is alleged to have been beaten in a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last month.

On Thursday, reports in the city suggested Smollett may have staged the incident along with two men after he feared he was being written out of musical drama Empire.

However, detectives have issued a statement denying this is the case. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

“Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Fox, the network which produces Empire, released a statement to say Smollett was “core” to the show and was not being written out.

The 36-year-old made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America this week and said he had been “forever changed” by the alleged attack.

He said: “I will never be the man who this didn’t happen to.

“I am forever changed and I don’t subscribe to the idea that everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.”

Asked what message he wanted to send by speaking about the attack, he replied: “I want young people, young members of the LGTBQ community, young black children, to know how strong they are, to know the power they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett has starred in Fox’s musical drama Empire since 2015. He plays Jamal, the gay son of a music mogul, played by Terrence Howard.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged attack.

Here’s what is known: Chicago police have confirmed Thursday that the two individuals who were previously seen on surveillance footage near where the Empire actor claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault on Jan. 29 were brought in for questioning. The police have dubbed the duo “persons of interest” in the case.

Late Thursday, at least two Chicago outlets reported that police believed Smollett worked with the other two individuals to stage the crime as a hoax and that Smollett was being written out of Empire. But a Chicago PD communications officer said Thursday evening on Twitter that the reports are “unconfirmed” as well as “uninformed and inaccurate.” The Chicago ABC station reports that police confirmed Smollett “is considered a victim and the investigation is ongoing.”

Also, 20th Century Fox Television, the studio behind Empire, issued a statement slamming the report: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Local Chicago media reports have additionally claimed that the two individuals being questioned worked as extras on Empire and are of Nigerian descent. Chicago PD has not confirmed this, however, and police have not replied to EW’s request for comment.

Meanwhile, representatives for Smollett say, “Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate.”

On Friday, local media reported that Chicago police released this update: “Interviews will resume today with the two people of interest and their attorney. While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as the victim, not a suspect. The investigation continues.”

The news comes on the heels of Smollett, 36, sitting down with Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts to share his full account. “I’m pissed off,” he had said of such claims in a promo clip released ahead of Thursday’s segment.

“I went to the Subway, got my order,” Smollett said. “During that time I texted my manager, thinking that he was still in Australia…I said, ‘Call me when you can.’ He called me immediately and while he was on the phone, I heard as I was crossing the intersection, ‘Empire!’ And I don’t answer to Empire, my name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer, I kept walking, and then I heard, ”f— Empire n—.’ So I turned around and I said, ‘What the f— did you just say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘This MAGA country, n—,’ and he punched me right in the face. So I punched his a— back and then we started tussling.”

The actor remembered, “There was a second person involved who was kicking me in my back and then it just stopped and they ran off.” It was only after getting back on the phone (which was still on during the attack) with his manager that he realized there was a noose around his neck and a liquid (that appeared to be bleach) poured on his person. “It happened so fast,” he said. “It felt like minutes but it was probably 30 seconds.”

Smollett also addressed reports that his ribs had allegedly been fractured. “My clavicle was messed up, my ribs were bruised but nothing was cracked,” he said. “Like, I walked into the hospital, I walked out of the hospital.

“It became a thing of like, ‘Oh, It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,'” he said. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” he added. “A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.”

Smollett pointed to reports that he allegedly described the attackers as wearing MAGA hats, which he didn’t say: “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—, they called me a n—. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of a racist sundae.”

Citing ""new evidence as a result of today's interrogations"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter that the two men ""have now been released without charging.""

""Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Guglielmi added.

Police had said in a statement earlier that the brothers were taken into custody on “probable cause that they may have committed a crime” in the reported Jan. 29 attack on Smollett.

Guglielmi pushed back against earlier media reports suggesting the attack was a hoax.

He said in an email: ""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

Guglielmi said detectives were working to corroborate Smollett's allegations and establish a timeline of how the attack unfolded.

The suspects are brothers of Nigerian descent and were picked up Wednesday by Chicago Police at O’Hare International Airport after returning from travel, according to a police department source who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation. At least one of the suspects worked on the set of ""Empire,"" the source told USA TODAY.

Guglielmi said that search warrants were served on the potential suspects’ Chicago homes.

As questions arose this week around Smollett's claim that two men attacked him last month, the TV network and studio behind the Fox drama gave its full support to the actor and musician.

In addition, police disputed a TV news report that cited multiple anonymous sources saying Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the show.

FOX Entertainment and 20th Century FOX Television, which produces the Chicago-based family drama, sent USA TODAY a statement Thursday in response to a question raised in a Chicago TV news report that multiple anonymous sources were saying Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement said.

Guglielmi disputed the tweet by a reporter from Chicago's ABC affiliate, which said sources were saying that Smollett and two men staged the attack and were being questioned by police. Guglielmi said the Chicago police superintendent told the news outlet that its sources are ""uninformed and inaccurate.""

""Media reports (about) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi's tweet said.

The ABC 7 Chicago reporter who tweeted the initial report of sources saying the attack was a hoax later took to social to media to say that Johnson had called the station to say Smollett ""is considered a victim and the police investigation"" is continuing.

Smollett's representative, Pamela Sharp, told USA TODAY Thursday that the actor answered ""routine follow-up questions"" from Chicago police and ""continues to cooperate.""

Earlier Thursday, ABC's ""Good Morning America"" aired portions of an interview Smollett gave to anchor Robin Roberts. The actor, who is black and openly gay, recounted details of the attack, which he said included racist and homophobic slurs, and also said those doubting him ""don't even want to see this is the truth.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” he said.

In an emotional new TV interview, “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett tried to end doubt that he was attacked last month in Chicago by two men who shouted slurs at him, hit him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a rope around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

“I am an advocate. I respect too much the people – who I am now one of those people – who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this,” Smollett told “Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts.

Most of the interview – which took place in Chicago where Smollett films the Fox drama “Empire” – aired Thursday morning on “GMA” and the rest was scheduled to air Thursday night on “Nightline.” It is Smollett’s first TV interview since he reported being attacked in the 300 block of East North Water Street in the Streeterville neighborhood about 2 a.m. Jan. 29. He was walking between a Subway restaurant and his apartment at the time.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative,” Smollett told Roberts. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Smollett said he didn’t want to call the police at first, but his friend and creative director, Frank Gatson, did so on his behalf. Smollett said he was in shock when police arrived at his apartment. “I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out. I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little – the rope burn around my neck. And then – but I smelled bleach. I know the smell of bleach, and I saw on my sweatshirt it had marks on it, like spots on it when you have a bad bleach job,” he said. “So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me. . . . I mean, it wasn’t, like, wrapped around. But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see.”

Chicago police had sought Smollett’s phone records since shortly after he reported the attack because he said he was on the phone with his manager at the time it occurred.

But police said this week that the phone records Smollett and his manager provided weren’t sufficient for solving the case that has quickly captured nationwide attention. Smollett confirmed he didn’t hand over his phone when he talked to police.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but – I’m not gonna do that,” Smollett said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmates’ number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

He added: “I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for – and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.”

Smollett said some media outlets incorrectly reported that he said his attackers wore MAGA hats – a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

“I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f — , they called me a n — . There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae,” he said.

Smollett, who is openly gay and has emerged as an activist for LGBTQ rights and HIV education, expressed hope that police will find his attackers.

Police have scoured surveillance footage from cameras around Streeterville but have not found footage of the attack. Police did identify two potential persons of interest who were spotted walking near the area around the time of the incident, but the images police released from surveillance footage are dark and the faces are not clear.

Smollett believes these two people are his attackers.

“‘Cause . . . I was there,” he told Roberts when asked how he is sure those are his attackers. “For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere,’ you know what I’m saying? So, yeah, I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Smollett said he also told police about a letter he received a week before the attack, on Jan. 22. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off a letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in southwest suburban Bedford Park on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters MAGA were written in the upper-left corner of the envelope.

Smollett said a stick figure was shown hanging from a tree with the words “Smollett Jussie you will die black f —.”

“Did I make that up too?” Smollett said in the interview with Roberts.

Police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are related, and so far they are being investigated separately: the letter by the FBI and the alleged attack by Chicago police.

Days after reporting the attack, Smollett performed a previously scheduled concert at a West Hollywood club. Shortly thereafter, he returned to work on the “Empire” set playing gay musician Jamal Lyon. He was nominated this week for an NAACP Image Award for this role.

“I think that what people need to hear is just the truth,” Smollett told Roberts. “‘Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community – young, black children – to know how strong that they are.”

Chicago police have arrested two potential suspects in the attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett to hold them for questioning, according to Chicago PD spokesperson Sally Born. But no one has been charged in the January 29 incident in which the actor told police that two masked men shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him.

On Thursday afternoon, Chicago’s ABC 7 released a story claiming that Chicago police were investigating whether Jussie Smollett staged his January attack. “Multiple sources tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet[sic] and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack — allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” tweeted ABC 7’s Rob Elgas. Now multiple sources — including Chicago PD and 20th Century Fox — are disputing the story.

Earlier in the day, two men were questioned in connection to the attack. According to the ABC story, Smollett failed to turn up for questioning at that time. Chicago PD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi denied the claims, tweeting, “We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.” 20th Century Fox, producer of Empire, has released a statement in support of Smollett as well. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” they wrote. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

According to the New York Times, two brothers have been questioned in Smollett’s case, one of whom knows him from working on the TV show. According to updates from the CPD to Times reporters Friday morning, the brothers are “classified as potential suspects” and detectives “have probable cause they may have been involved in an alleged crime,” but also note that there is “no evidence to say that this is a hoax.”

Update, February 15: The New York Times first reported on Friday that one of the brothers the Chicago Police Department brought in for questioning appeared on Empire. Sources have now confirmed to Vulture that one of the suspects has a connection to the show. No charges have been filed yet.

Update, February 15: On Friday evening, Chicago Police Department Deputy Director of News Affairs & Communications Tom Ahern tweeted that due to “new evidence,” the men brought in for questioning have been released without being charged, noting that law enforcement now has “additional investigative work to complete.”

For weeks, Empire star Jussie Smollett has kept up the narrative that he was viciously attacked in Chicago by pro-Trump supporters in an apparent hate crime. Now, local media reports claim that police investigating the incident believe that the whole thing was staged.

Chicago police raided the home of two “persons of interest” Wednesday night (Feb. 13), CBS Chicago reported. A relative of the “persons of interest,” two men, said police took bleach, shoes, electronics, receipts and other items from the home.

This information is according to family who says home was ransacked. I asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for #Nigeria the day of the attack. @cbschicago — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 14, 2019

The two men, both of Nigerian descent, have appeared as extras on Empire, and their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said that they both know Smollett.

“They do know Jussie,” she said. “They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

The relative who was home Wednesday night during the raid said she heard a loud banging at the door before the door came crashing down and officers burst in saying they had a search warrant.

The woman, who is in her 20s, said she was patted down by an officer and was asked if she knows Smollett. The unidentified woman said she was “so scared” she thought she was going to die. She said she was confused by what was going on, but did know Smollett was from the show.

The woman said she thinks police picked the two brothers up for questioning because of their loose connection to Smollett, and the men left for Nigeria the same day of the attack.

An attorney for the two men said they were visiting family in Nigeria and were picked up at Chicago’s O’Hare airport Wednesday night. Police confirmed Smollett himself was also questioned at CPD Area Central Thursday.

According to ABC 7 Eyewitness News, police “are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire.'”

A spokesman for Chicago police, however, said those reports are unconfirmed, and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said they will continue to treat Jussie Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing.

Additionally, reps for Smollett said reports that he was being written off Empire are not true.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

Netflix — which is on the same location at L.A. news station KTLA and a few other media organizations and offices — had their employees shelter in place as police made sweeps outside and within the building.

It’s still somewhat unclear at this moment exactly what the threat was, but later media reports placed a “man with a deadly weapon” as the focus of police investigation at the studio.

But, as the media noted less than an hour after the lockdown was first put in place, a suspect was arrested and LAPD eventually lifted the shelter-in-place order (below):

ABC Chicago reported that Chicago police are now investigating whether Smollett lied about the attack — and whether he had help from two people.

Sources told the news station that police picked up two persons of interest at O'Hare International Airport Wednesday night and questioned them.

According to CBS Chicago, the men are of Nigerian descent and have appeared on the ""Empire"" show with Smollett as extras. Police served a search warrant at a home they are staying at and took bleach, shoes, electronic devices, receipts, and other items.

Smollett is reported to have skipped a follow-up interview with police on Thursday. ABC reported that Smollett's motivation for potentially making up the story was that he is being written off ""Empire.""

Police would not confirm the reports.

The 36-year-old Smollett is openly gay and told police he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 in Chicago. He said the attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, and hurled racial and homophobic slurs as they beat him up and placed a noose around his neck.

Holes have appeared in Smollett's story, however, which has raised the possibility that he made it up.

Sources say Smollett may have faked the beating because he was being fired from Empire, but Fox, the Chicago PD, and Smollett push back.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating whether out actor Jussie Smollett conspired with two men to fake an attack on him in the early hours of January 29, according to Chicago's ABC and CBS affiliates and TMZ, but Chicago PD blasted the reports.

Detectives are speaking to the two individuals photographed walking in the area of downtown Chicago near where the incident took place, according to TMZ. Smollett told police he was attacked by two men who hurled racist and antigay slurs at him, screamed ""MAGA,"" beat him, poured an unknown liquid on his body, and hung a rope around his neck.

Responding to rampant internet rumors, Smollett recently denied he faked the attack. But multiple sources told ABC7 that Smollett staged the beating because was upset he was being written off of Fox's Empire, which films in Chicago. Smollett reported that a threatening letter directed towards him was sent to Empire's production office a week before the attack.

""The idea that Jussie Smollet has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" a Fox spokesperson tells The Advocate. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Police on Wednesday allegedly raided the homes of the two men captured on camera, and ABC7 says at least one of them worked on Empire; TMZ says both men worked on the show. The two men were ""picked up"" by police at O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday evening for questioning; neither has been arrested or faces charges. TMZ identified the men as Nigerians and said they flew to the African nation the day of the attack; the police allegedly followed their movements and were waiting at O'Hare when they returned to Chicago.

But the Chicago Police Department disputes this reporting.

""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.""

The openly gay actor says he was attacked in the early morning on January 29 by two masked men, as the Inquisitr previously reported. The Empire star was taken to the hospital after the two men placed a noose around his neck and poured liquid on him that he says smelled like bleach.

The following day, police released a video showing two people who were in the area when the attack occurred. Smollett said that he was confident that the two individuals were the people who attacked him. While speaking with Good Morning America, he also said that he was angry that people doubted the authenticity of his report.

“For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘O.K., we’re getting somewhere.'” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Smollett has faced doubt about the authenticity of the attack, with some people suggesting that the absence of security footage exposed the actor’s story. As the Inquisitr reported, Smollett has also been criticized for failing to turn over sufficient evidence to police. The actor maintains that the events occurred as he reported them."

ABC News(CHICAGO) — Police in Chicago have identified and are questioning two “persons of interest” in an alleged racial attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

One those persons of interest has previously appeared on “Empire,” according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation

Smollett is also being questioned by police at this time, the official said.

“Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” Smollett’s representatives said in a statement to ABC News.

Neither of the “persons of interest” has been charged with any crime related to the alleged attack, and there is no evidence that they were involved in any attack on the actor, police said.

But a law enforcement official told ABC News that the homes of the two people being questioned were searched overnight by police for possible evidence.

Authorities retrieved shoes, electronic devices and other items they believe could help them determine whether the two people played any role in the alleged assault, the official said.

Nobody has been charged in connection with the attack.

Chicago police used surveillance technology to track the movements of the two individuals using cameras, public transportation records, and corroborating information provided by Smollett, according to a spokesman.

“We know who they are and have brought them in for questioning,” a Chicago Police Department spokesman said on Friday.

Late last month, Smollett told police he was brutally attacked in what authorities are calling a suspected hate crime.

He was subsequently hospitalized and released, local authorities said.

Smollett told police that the men also allegedly poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, police said. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when police spoke to him, officials said.

And while Chicago Police have told ABC News that Smollett is only being viewed as the victim in this investigation, the actor is still bothered by some chatter online that his story may have changed in any way.

In his first interview since police say he was attacked last month, the singer and actor said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” Smollett, 36, told ABC News’ Robin Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth,” he added.

Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox’s “Empire,” said the attack happened on Jan. 29, at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, according to an initial incident report.

He said the attackers put a noose around his neck, poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him and used their hands, feet and teeth as weapons in the assault, according to the report, which ABC News obtained last week via a Freedom of Information Act request. Smollett said the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the attack — a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

The singer said he sustained injuries to his clavicle bone and bruised ribs during the attack, but some still questioned if he made the story up.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett said earlier reporting by various media outlets claiming his attackers were wearing MAGA hats was inaccurate.

Others suggested that he may have lied in his explanation for being outside at 2 a.m. in sub-zero Chicago weather, but Smollett said “that’s ridiculous.”

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said.

“I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive,” he added.

Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.

“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” the singer said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”

“I don’t know what that’s gonna be, to hand over my phone for — and honestly, by then, inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there,” he added.

The musician said he’s hopeful that police will track down the suspects. He also believes the two potential persons of interest in a photo released by police in the days after the attack are the perpetrators.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” Smollett said. “Never did.”

But there’s no doubt in his mind that the attack was racially motivated.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says, “f—– ‘Empire’ n—–,” “This is MAGA country, n—–,” ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” he asked. “It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”

Smollett decided to speak out so people could hear the “truth.”

“I think people need to hear the truth,” he said. “‘Cause everybody has their own idea. Some are healing and some are hurtful, but I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community — young, black children — to know how strong that they are.”

Police spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, who are believed to have been seen on surveillance images on the night of the attack.

Rob Elgas, a reporter at ABC 7 in Chicago, reported Thursday afternoon that ""multiple sources"" said that Smollett and the two men staged the attack because his character was being written off the show. Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, cited a source who said that investigators believe the ""non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.""

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said that the reports were ""ridiculous rumors.""

AAP

""He's been very cooperative and very consistent,"" she said.

Police have not commented on the report. Earlier Thursday, police said they were questioning the two men but that they were not considered suspects. Local media reported that one of the men had appeared as an extra on ""Empire."" Elgas reported that Smollett did not appear for a scheduled interview on Thursday. Sharp contradicted that, saying that Smollett did answer additional police questions in person on Thursday.

Charlie De Mar, a reporter at CBS Chicago, spoke Thursday with family members of the two men who were being questioned. They told De Mar that the men are brothers, and are from Nigeria. They left for Nigeria on the day of the attack, De Mar reported. The police reportedly asked the family members if they knew Smollett. De Mar posted a search warrant receipt, showing that investigators had found a laptop, shoes, and bleach at the home.

A police spokesman said on Twitter he would not release details of the investigation while the men are being questioned.

AAP/Chicago Police Department

""Media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time,"" spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Smollett's rep said earlier in the day that he was glad to see progress was being made.

""We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" she said.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that he had been accosted at 2 a.m. that morning by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, put a rope around his neck, and doused him in bleach.

On January 30, police released surveillance images of two figures who were in the area at the time of the alleged attack, and described them as ""persons of interest"" in the case. In an interview on Good Morning America on Thursday, Smollett said he was convinced that the two were the attackers.

An hour after after a bombshell report Thursday claiming the alleged racist and homophobic attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be a hoax, Chicago Police were already disputing it, as the mysterious case grew even more curious.

Chicago police late Thursday denied reports by a Chicago TV station that Jussie Smollett worked with two men to stage a racist and homophobic assault on himself, allegedly to keep his character from being written off the show.

Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said that police cannot confirm the Chicago TV station’s report that Smollett and two other men that the police have been questioning about the alleged attack on the “Empire” actor perpetrated a hoax.

“Media reports (about) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

ABC 7 in Chicago tweeted that according to multiple sources Smollett and two men orchestrated the attack possibly because Smollett’s character was being written out of the Fox drama.

“BREAKING: Multiple (sources) tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollett and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack — allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” according to the station’s tweet.

CBS 2 in Chicago had a similar report.

Smollett said he was attacked outside of his Chicago apartment in the early morning of Jan. 29.

According to officials, the openly gay 36-year-old actor and LGBTQ activist said attackers first yelled racial and homophobic slurs before they beat him and poured an unknown chemical substance over him. They also reportedly yelled “This is MAGA country,” and one wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck.

Jussie Smollett probe shifts after suspects released

Is Donald Trump Jr. promoting a Jussie Smollett conspiracy theory? Police on Wednesday picked up two men at O’Hare Airport and questioned them about the alleged assault. TMZ reported that a raid of the men’s residences produced five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items. It had been reported that the substance poured on Smollett might have been bleach.

Family members of the two men said they left for their native Nigeria on the day of the alleged attack. Police kept tabs on their whereabouts and were waiting for them when they returned to Chicago on Wednesday.

Police said the two men are the same ones captured on a surveillance video screen grab on the night of the alleged attack.

In a recent interview, Smollett said he was “pissed off” because people are questioning whether he’s telling the truth.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth,'” he said."

Jeff Schear Empire actors Taraji P. Henson and Jussie Smollett in Chicago in 2017.

After two local Chicago news stations cited sources alleging that Jussie Smollett had staged an attack on him, 20th Century Fox and Fox — the studio and network behind Empire — issued a statement supporting the actor. Chicago's ABC affiliate reported that Smollett, along with two men, might have staged the attack on Jan. 29 out of fear that he was being written off of Empire. The story gained national attention immediately because Smollett told police his attackers had thrown a bleachlike chemical on him, called him anti-gay slurs, and put a rope around his neck. But on Thursday, Fox and 20th Century Fox refuted that report. ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the statement read. A source close to Fox also confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the network believes the attack on Smollett ""really happened,"" and he remains a ""key player"" on Empire. An executive producer on the show also tweeted that Smollett's character was never in danger of being written off.

Having been in on every story move on Empire for the past three seasons, I can tell you unequivocally that Jussie’s character Jamal was never in danger of being “written off”. #askawriter

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi also tweeted Thursday night that media reports about the incident being a hoax ""are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" and that police Superintendent Eddie Johnson himself had called ABC Chicago to state on the record that ""we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate."" The actor, who plays one of the most prominent black gay men on television, told officers in January that two men brutally beat him. According to police, Smollett said they tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical on him, and shouted racist and anti-gay slurs at him. The attackers also yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" police said Smollett reported. Shortly after the attack, police reviewed surveillance images in hopes of identifying the suspects. Two persons of interest have since been identified and were questioned by investigators, Guglielmi said Thursday. The individuals are not suspects, but ""were in area of concern and are being questioned,"" he said on Twitter. CBS Chicago reported the two men were taken in during a raid on their home, where police found a laptop, shoes, and bleach. The men are reportedly of Nigerian descent, and, according to their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, have appeared as extras on Empire. “They do know Jussie,” she told CBS. “They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest."" Schmidt could not immediately be reached by BuzzFeed News Thursday night.

Days after the attack, Smollett performed at a nightclub in West Hollywood and addressed what had happened, telling the crowd ""I fought the fuck back."" In an interview on Good Morning America Thursday, Smollett said the attack has left him ""forever changed.""

ABC Chicago reporter Rob Elgas tweeted on Thursday that “multiple sources” believe that Smollett and his two assailants orchestrated the headline-making crime, allegedly because his character, Jamal, was being written out of Empire. Another Chicago reporter, CBS’ Charlie De Mar, said that two persons of interest whose home was raided by police previously appeared as extras on the Fox drama.

Chicago PD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, however, issued a statement on Thursday saying, “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. [Superintendent] Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Supt. Johnson told ABC Chicago that Smollett “is considered a victim and the police investigation is ongoing.”

Empire producer 20th Century Fox Television, meanwhile, issued a statement undercutting the motive for any alleged hoax, saying, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett sought treatment at a hospital in Chicago, where Empire is filmed, following his alleged late-January attack, in which two men supposedly approached the actor/singer and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. According to the original account, the two men beat Smollett, poured a chemical substance (believed to be bleach) on him and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett also told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack.

Smollett performed at an L.A. concert days after the attack, and appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America this Thursday morning to give his account of the incident, saying that he’s been “forever changed” by it."

For the past two weeks, one of the entertainment world’s biggest stories has been an alleged motivated attack on actor and performer Jussie Smollett. Now, a report from Chicago affiliate ABC7 claims that the incident may not have been a hate crime, but a staged situation meant to benefit Smollett’s career — while “Empire” producer 20th Century Fox and the Chicago Police Department have made statements denying the report.

ABC7 reports that Smollett did not appear for a planned Thursday interview with detectives and that investigators are questioning a pair of individuals who may have been involved. The report cites sources who say that Smollett’s character being phased out of the Fox show “Empire” may have been a possible motivation for staging the incident.

However, a statement from 20th Century Fox denies that there were any plans to write off Smollett from the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.” – STATEMENT FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION AND FOX ENTERTAINMENT — 20th Century Fox TV (@20centuryfoxTV) February 15, 2019

In addition, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department shot down the ABC7 report.

When details first emerged about the alleged attack on the night of January 29, they included claims that Smollett was assaulted by a pair of young men. After shouting gay and racial slurs, the initial reports also asserted that the two men proceeded to “batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.”

Many throughout various corners of the entertainment industry and the LGBTQ community had spent much of the intervening time since Smollett’s hospitalization voicing support for him and condemnation of the alleged crime. At the recently completed Television Critics Association press tour, Smollett’s colleagues on “Empire” spoke firmly about the actor’s resolve, and Fox CEO Charlie Collier also offered condolences. The Smollett family’s collective statement on the issue labeled the alleged attack as “a racial and homophobic hate crime” and an act of “domestic terrorism.”

Jussie Smollett has made a number of public statements about the incident, including one in writing to Essence Magazine and an interview on the Thursday morning edition of ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Days after January 29, still insisting it was an attack motivated by both his race and orientation, Smollett performed to a sold-out audience at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, concluding his set by saying, “We are proud. We are gay.”

There is a whole new round of controversy today when it comes to Empire and Jussie Smollett, mostly thanks to rumors.

Most of them today stem from local ABC reporter Rob Elgas, who cited multiple sources in his claim that the attack on Smollett earlier this year was staged due to the actor being written off the show later on this season. (There have been rumors about a key death coming later this season.)

However, since the time of this report there have been multiple denials, starting with the Chicago Police Department itself. In a statement, here is what Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi had to say on the subject:

Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted [ABC 7 Chicago] to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.

Meanwhile, Fox and the studio 20th Century Fox TV issued a joint statement tonight, one in which they denied the reports that he was being written off the show:

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous … He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

This is obviously still a developing story, but one thing is certainly clear at this point: It’s also a super-complicated story and more than likely, it’s only going to get more complicated over time. There have been so many rumors and complications at the moment and we have to wait and see where things are going to go from here.

Ultimately, the best thing that needs to be done at the moment is just wait and see what the final results are of the investigation. Otherwise, the world just devolves into everyone sniping on social media about who is right — which is basically what this world is coming to at this point.

Empire is currently on hiatus, but is slated to return with new episodes on Fox next month. We’ll have more news in the context of the show itself soon enough. The series is charting towards a season 6 renewal, which will probably be confirmed a little bit later in the spring.

For now, be sure to let us know what you think about some of the latest rumors surrounding Jussie now in the comments. (Photo: Fox.)

In an extraordinary step, the police department’s top spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, put out a statement on Twitter that said: “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives”

He said the police superintendent had contacted one of the stations to “state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

That came after CBS and ABC affiliates in Chicago quoted unidentified sources as saying that detectives either believed or were investigating whether Smollett had staged the incident with the help of two men.

Earlier in the day, the Chicago Police Department did confirm they had identified two “persons of interest” in the alleged attack.

Authorities were reportedly able identify the suspects “using cameras, public transportation records and corroborating info provided by Smollett,” but police were unable to find video surveillance footage of the attack.

The Chicago Tribune reported that the men—one of whom had appeared in Empire were picked up at the airport Wednesday night and brought in for questioning.

Hours after that, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America and recounted the Jan. 29 attack and complained that doubts had been raised about his account.

He described how he was called homophobic and racial slurs while he was walking home from Subway early that morning. He then said one of the men punched him.

“So I punched his ass back,” Smollet said. They allegedly fought on ice before the two men ran off. Then Smollet realized they poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says ‘Fucking Empire n---er, this is MAGA country, n---er, ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?”"

In a statement online this afternoon, a spokesman for the Chicago PD offered an update on the ongoing investigation into the Jan. 29 assault on Smollett, as well as a stern rebuke to local media.

“Today Jussie did answer routine follow-up questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate,” reps for the actor said Thursday. Smollett plays openly gay Jamal Lyon on the Fox hip-hop drama created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong.

Earlier in the day, ABC and CBS affiliates in Chicago went with stories that Smollett was believed to possibly be in cahoots with two men brought in for questioning about the attack today. The outlets claimed the actor may have planned the assault in an idea that it would keep him on the Chicago-filmed show – a show Fox now says he was never being written off of.

The co-creator of Empire and others on the show also shot down the notion that Smollett was exiting the series:

There is 0% truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire. This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed. — Danny Strong (@Dannystrong) February 15, 2019

The writers of Empire have never planned or even discussed writing @JussieSmollett off of the show. — Empire Writers (@EmpireWriters) February 15, 2019

Guglielmi tweeted shortly after Smollett’s GMA appearance this morning that through a “meticulous investigation,” detectives “have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.”

Shortly after that tweet, Guglielmi tweeted, “Important for media reporting: The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

That “alleged victim” is of course Smollett, who has received almost universal support from his Empire co-workers, Hollywood and even Donald Trump.

After a delayed flight from NYC, the actor was just back in Chicago when around 2 AM on the morning of January 29 two men began screaming derogatory slurs at him on the street near where he lives. The duo then started striking Smollett again and again. They are also said to have poured an unknown chemical substance over him now thought to have been bleach.

Additionally, the assailants were said to have put a rope around Smollett’s neck before leaving the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital to be seen by doctors. Bruised but not admitted to the facility, the Empire star returned to his local apartment that morning and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Soon afterwards, the Chicago PD said they were treating the incident as a “possible hate crime.” On January 31, one day after local law enforcement released photos of “persons of interest” in the matter, Guglielmi referred to the matter as an “assault and battery case.”

On the day of the attack, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment

said in a statement they were “deeply saddened and outraged” by the assault.

At a previously scheduled show at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on February 2, Smollett directly addressed the matter on everybody’s minds. As the FBI assisted investigation continued back in Chicago, the performer told the packed club: “I had to be here tonight!”

He added to roars of support from the audience, “I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win!”"

UPDATE: Representatives for Jussie Smollett say “Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate.” — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019

As previously reported, police wanted Smollett to re-submit his phone records, after the first ones he provided were a “heavily redacted” PDF of his call log.

Chicago Police told Page Six on Tuesday the records he provided for the investigation into his alleged attack were “limited and redacted” and “insufficient for a criminal investigation,” and that they needed something “more concrete.”

“We need something a little more concrete and direct if we’re going to be able to say for a fact the conversation occurred,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told the outlet, in reference to a conversation the actor said he had with his manager during the alleged attack.

“We don’t believe this is the case at all, but when anyone hands over a redacted and limited record like a PDF of a phone bill, for example, those records could be manipulated,” he added. “We don’t believe they are, but we have to be able to hold up to the standards of a criminal court … [the records] don’t meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

Chris Bastardi, a spokesperson for Smollett, explained that the redacted records were “intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

The developments come on the heels of reports that police were seeking “people of interest” after the “Empire” star told authorities he was attacked by masked men near his home last month in Chicago.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi stated. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. They called him an Empire … and they used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Smollett told police at the time of the attack that he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, who told police that he heard the racist and homophobic slurs. Police, therefore, need the phone records to corroborate the two accounts of what allegedly occurred."

... a new development in the Jussie Smollett investigation has caused authorities to wonder whether the Empire actor actually staged his own attack late last month.

As previously reported, surveillance footage taken from the vicinity around where the alleged assault took place early on the morning of January 29 depicted two men walking down the sidewalk.

Police released photos of these two men and labeled them as ""persons of interest"" in the investigation.

Here is one of the images unveiled to the public by the Chicago PD a couple weeks ago:

According to TMZ and other outlets, the two men featured above were picked up by cops at O'Hare Airport on Wednesday night and taken in for questioning.

Moreover, per WBBM TV reporter Charlie De Mar, the homes of these individuals were raided yesterday.

Now here is where things get legitimately weird and troubling:

The suspects are of Nigerian descent and both appeared as extras on Empire.

Multiple insiders have told the local ABC affiliate in Chicago that police are investigating whether Smollett worked with these two men to stage the assault because Smollet's character was being written off Empire.

To be clear, no one associated with the police department has commented on this possibility just yet.

However, Rob Elgas - a reporter at ABC 7 in Chicago - Tweeted the details of this theory on Thursday evening.

He added that Smollett did not appear for a scheduled interview on Thursday.

Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, has also cited a source who said that investigators believe the “non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.""

Smollett and his team have claimed on numerous occasions that the star was approached by two assailants around 2 a.m. on January 29.

They say these assailants hurled racial and anti-gay epithets in Smollet's direction; that they screamed he was in ""MAGA country;"" that theu doused him in bleach; and that they tied a rope around his neck.

The attack made national headlines, with 2020 Presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker commenting on the hate crime and President Trump also labeling it as ""horrible.""

In the days since, however, some people have questioned the validity of Smollett's story.

They've wondered why he didn't call the police right away and why he's seemed hesitant to turn over his cell phone, and/or non-redacted records for his cell phone, to the authorities.

Smollett, who si 36 years old and who has been openly gay since 2015, appeared on Good Morning America on Thursday.

He fought off tears at various points while talking to Robin Roberts and addressed those who doubted his story.

“You don't even want to see the truth,"" he said of these critics, adding:

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more.

""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Roberts asked Smollett about the time lapse between the attack and his 911 call, to which Smollett said the following...

""There's a level of pride there.

""We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow, to be weak, and I'm not weak. I am not weak. And we, as a people, are not weak.""

He went on to say it was ""offensive"" and ""ridiculous"" to allege that he was lying about this assault.

UPDATE: A lawyer for the two suspects has talked to the aforementioned CBS reporter, Edwards.

She's confirmed that the men do know Smollett from their work on Empire, telling the journalist:

“They do know Jussie. They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight.

""They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

Edwards writes that police took bleach, shoes, electronics, receipts and other items from the home of these men -- and he quotes a ""TOP SOURCE"" who sayss:

Indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event.

This is a truly crazy twist.

We aren't about to rush to judgment in either direction, but we will keep readers apprised as more news breaks.

UPDATE:

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment have released a statement in response to the rumor that Smollett was being written off Empire.

It reads as follows:

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand by him.""

Again, we will update this article as more information comes in.

UPDATE: Says the Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago Police Department:

Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate."

Meanwhile, Fox denied that Smollett was being written off “Empire.”

The hoax reports originated with two Chicago stations, one of which raised the possibility that Smollett staged the attack with two men to avoid being written off the show.

“Multiple sources tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack — allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” the affiliate’s reporter, Rob Elgas, tweeted.

Meanwhile, CBS Chicago reported Thursday that police raided the home of two persons of interest in the case on Wednesday night. The site said they are brothers of Nigerian descent who appeared as extras on Smollett’s show, “Empire.” The mens’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said they both know Smollett, CBS Chicago reported.

Schmidt did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Fox did not immediately respond to request for comment about whether the two men appeared on “Empire.”

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Chicago PD tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment added: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

And Smollet’s rep, Pamela Sharp, told TheWrap: “Jussie is NOT being written off Empire. Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate.”

According to De Mar, the men left for Nigeria the day of the attack. De Mar also posted a search warrant receipt, which shows police took bleach, shoes and a laptop.

Twitter sleuths and some news organizations began floating theories that Smollett had faked the attack within days of him reporting it. He said two men beat him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” Police said they had no reason to doubt him, but a public disagreement mounted between police and Smollett when he initially declined to hand over his phone. Officers wanted it to confirm that he was speaking to his manager during the attack.

Smollett handed over his phone records this week.

In a statement Tuesday, before the news reports with hoax speculation, GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said Smollett had been “doubly victimized” — first in the attack, and then later by “speculation” about the incident from the media.

The saga surrounding the alleged hate crime attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett took a dramatic turn on Thursday amid multiple reports that Chicago police took two “persons of interest” into questioning, including one man who reportedly worked with Smollett as an actor on “Empire.” A Chicago ABC affiliate and CBS Chicago reported Thursday evening that sources close to the case said police are investigating whether Smollett and the two persons of interest potentially “staged the attack.”

“Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire,'” ABC7 reported Thursday evening.

“Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack — or whether the attack happened at all,” Chicago police told ABC, the outlet reported in an update to its original report. Citing a source familiar with the investigation, ABC says that Smollett also “failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday, but has since spoken with police.”

CBS Chicago also reports that sources say police are investigating if the alleged attack was “potentially staged” by the “non-cooperating” persons of interest and the actor. “Investigators believe Jussie Smollett and the non-cooperating witnesses in the alleged attack of Smollett last month ‘potentially staged the attack,’ sources tell CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards,” the outlet reports.

Earlier Thursday, multiple outlets, including The Chicago Tribune, reported that police had confirmed that they detained two persons of interest at O’Hare International Airport for questioning about their potential involvement in the case Wednesday night. One of the men reportedly appeared on “Empire,” ABC News confirmed.

According to ABC, law enforcement officials say the homes of the two persons of interest were raided Wednesday night, noting that officials “removed shoes, electronic devices and other items they believe could help them determine if the two people played any role in the assault from those homes.”

The outlet stresses that Chicago police told them they “cannot confirm any of those reports” and that no charges have been filed. In an update posted Thursday night, ABC reports that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson contacted the outlet to clarify that the department is “continuing to treat Smollett as a victim and the investigation remains ongoing.”

In response to ABC’s initial report, Smollett’s representatives issued a statement saying the actor “did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate” and that he is not being written off “Empire.” The outlet reports that Fox has also denied the “patently ridiculous” claim, stating, “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Thursday evening, CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar quoted a “top source” as saying, “We [investigators] believe the non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack” (post below).

“The brothers were returning from a trip to Nigeria, their attorney said,” De Mar said in a follow-up report. “As they were picked up by police at O’Hare, officers were at their home, taking several items and leaving behind an inventory list of some of the items taken. The list includes a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.”

Smollett, a 36-year-old openly gay African American singer and actor, told police that he was brutally attacked at around 2 a.m. on January 29 while walking home from Subway in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood. According to Smollett, the two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with an unknown chemical (believed to be bleach), assaulted him, and put a rope around his neck. Along with allegedly calling him “n***er” and “f***ot,” he says they yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

But by the end of the first week of the investigation, police revealed that all available surveillance footage failed to show the attack. One piece of evidence emerged: a grainy image of two men dressed in dark clothing that Smollett said in an interview with “Good Morning America” Thursday were the two men.

Using the surveillance photos and, according to TMZ, “rideshare and/or taxicab records,” police say they were able to identify the two persons of interest and track them the night of the alleged attack.

UPDATE: On Friday, police issued a statement to the press clarifying that the two men were being considered “potential suspects” and Smollett “continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

According Variety, law enforcement spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, who are believed to have been seen on surveillance images on the night of the attack.

The new information comes on the heels of a report from CBS Chicago that alleges police ""raided the home of two persons of interest"" on Wednesday night, with the outlet revealing that the men were of ""Nigerian descent"" and apparently ""extras"" on the show.

Another CBS Chicago reporter, Charles De Mar took to Twitter on Thursday night, shortly before the report was released to the media that claims he ""asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for [Nigeria] the day of the attack,"" according to THR.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted by [ABC Chicago] to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi wrote.

The information comes after Chicago police on Thursday announced they had identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the attack, which Smollett said occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 by two men who yelled racist and homophobic language before and during his brutal attack.

""The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,"" Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi said Thursday. ""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.""

During a sitdown with Good Morning America on Thursday, Smollett addressed the conversation about the incident, and revealed how he fought back against the attackers.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f—, they called me a n—. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Shortly after the reports, FOX issued its own statement, and voiced their support to Smollett that the attack was not staged.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

It was reported on Thursday that the Chicago police were interviewing two persons of interest in the case, believed to be the two men seen in a surveillance video image released by the police shortly after the first report of the attack. The men turned out to be brothers from Nigeria, with police executing a search warrant on their home that same day. Investigators reportedly took a laptop, shoes, and bleach from the home.

On Jan. 29, it was reported that Smollett had been assaulted by two men at approximately 2 a.m. in the 300 block of E. North Water St. Smollett stated that the two men had shouted “racial and homophobic slurs” at him before beating him, pouring a chemical believed to be bleach on him, and putting a rope around his neck.

Also on Thursday, “Good Morning America” aired Smollett’s first interview since the incident. “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” Smollett said during the interview."

The statement comes after a local Chicago ABC affiliate reported that Smollett helped plan his own attack because he was being written off the Fox show Empire.

In a statement to Deadine, 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment debunked rumors that Smollett would be written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollet has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the statement reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The alleged attack occurred in the early hours of January 29 and left Smollett with a fractured rib. Smollett told investigators that his attackers yelled “MAGA country” during the attack, referencing Donald Trump’s popular campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” TMZ’s original report of the attack also said that Smollett had received intimidating mail at Fox studios that said “Die Black fag.”

Smollett’s representatives have previously fought back against rumors Smollett was lying about the attack.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement reads. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.”

Smollett’s statement followed reports that he had handed over records to police that were “heavily redacted.” At the time, Smollett’s team said that any redactions were done to “protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck after the attack exists, but police say they will not release the footage until the investigation is finished, according to The Advocate.

Smollett, who is both gay and black, says he is “pissed off” at the people who have questioned his claim that he is the victim of a hate crime. The skeptics don't believe the truth, the actor said in an interview with "" Good Morning America,"" which aired Thursday. In fact, he added, they ""don't even want to see the truth.""

""What is it that has you so angry? Is it the attackers?"" Robin Roberts asked.

""It's the attackers but it's also the attacks,"" Smollett responded. ""At first it was a thing of like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, cause it's the truth.'""

He added, “Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.'""

Smollett continued, theorizing that if he had said that his assailants were Muslim or Hispanic, then the people questioning his story now would’ve likely supported him immediately.

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,"" he said. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" Smollett added. ""I am forever changed. I don't subscribe to the idea everything happens for a reason, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right and the responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us, good and bad.""

See, this is annoying. Smollett may be the victim of a hate crime. The story is not easy to believe, but it's possible.

It’d be one thing if he were merely frustrated that so many have questioned whether he is telling the truth. But to confuse skepticism for racism? Come on. Surely — surely! — he must see that his story is a big ask.

Skeptics have questioned why two masked Trump supporters would wander downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in subzero temperatures. For that reasonable skepticism, Smollett alleges racism. Likewise, he blames racism for critics questioning why anyone would ever describe Chicago as “MAGA country,” as the actor claims one of his attackers yelled during the alleged crime. Smollett insinuates that it's racism to question the existence of Chicago “rednecks.”

Smollett insinuates racism where skeptics have questioned why the assailants just so happened to have an “an unknown chemical substance"" and rope on hand at 2 in the morning. Smollett insinuates racism where skeptics have wondered how his attackers managed to beat him, tie a rope around his neck, and pour an “unknown chemical substance"" on him all in the space of 60 seconds. Smollett insinuates that racism is behind the skepticism about his story. That skepticism is mostly based on the fact that his attack went uncaptured on camera in arguably the most surveilled city in the United States. Lastly, Smollett insinuates racism where some have questioned his unwillingness to turn his phone over to investigators. That is a very weird thing for him to refuse, considering he said his manager was on the line with him at the time of the attack and could confirm his story.

Critics are not wrong to ask these questions, especially in the current climate of hoax hate crimes.

The skeptics aren’t the problem. Smollett’s story is the problem."

“Multiple sources tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack – allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire,” the network’s reporter Rob Elgas tweeted.

20th Century Fox released the following statement, disputing the report, shortly after: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

This news also comes after a report by CBS Chicago said the police raided the home of two persons of interest in the attack on Wednesday night. The local news outlet reports that both men are of Nigerian descent and have appeared as extras on the show.

CBS Chicago reporter Charles De Mar tweeted on Thursday that he “asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for #Nigeria the day of the attack.”

The report also claims that police took bleach, shoes, electronics and other items from the home and that Smollett was questioned on Thursday as well.

Not long after, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter, “Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Chicago police for comment.

The news comes after Chicago police earlier on Thursday announced they had identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the attack, which Smollett said occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 by two assailants who yelled racist and homophobic language before and during the beating.

“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday. “They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

The actor also told police at the time that his attackers yelled pro-“Make America Great Again” (MAGA) comments during the attack, such as declaring Chicago “MAGA country.” According to a police report, a chemical substance was poured on Smollett’s face and a rope was placed around his neck.

In a sitdown interview that aired on Good Morning America on Thursday, Smollett addressed rumors about the incident, and said that he fought back against his attackers.

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett said. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

CHICAGO — Police investigating the alleged hate crime attack of ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett reportedly believe the incident was staged.

Officers reportedly say the non-cooperating witnesses and persons of interest in the “attack” left the country.

CBS Chicago broke the story: The men, who are both of Nigerian descent, have appeared as extras on the show and their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, says they do both know Smollett.

“They do know Jussie,” she said. “They have worked with him on Empire. My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

The woman says she was confused, but she did know Smollett was from the show. She says she feels the police picked the two brothers up for questioning because there is a loose connection to Smollett, and the men left for Nigeria the same day of the attack.

Watch the video report:

According to ABC7 Eyewitness News, police “are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.” ”

Smollett defended his story on Good Morning America:

On January 29, 2019, Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building upon returning home from walking to a fast-food restaurant, by two men in ski masks, who made racial and homophobic slurs and that the attackers used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault. According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then “poured an unknown liquid” on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.

The Chicago Police Department has promised to charge Smollett for filing a false police report in regards to the alleged hate crime if it was in fact fabricated."

ABC Chicago and CBS Chicago both claimed that 'multiple sources' had said detectives were considering the possibility that Smollett - together with two male persons of interest brought in for questioning Wednesday night - had faked the story because Smollett was being written off of Empire.

CBS reporters claimed that police sources said Smollet 'potentially staged the attack' and said 'indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event'.

The persons of interest are allegedly two former extras on Empire who are brothers and friends of Smollet - who traveled to Nigeria hours after the attack and returned on Wednesday when they were arrested at Chicago O'Hare airport.

Cops raided their home on Thursday and found numerous items including bleach and an Empire script.

Fox has now denied that Smollet was being written out of the show and Smollet has also repeatedly denied staging the attack.

In a statement Thursday evening, Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: 'Media reports anout (sic) the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

'Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.'

Around the same time, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a joint statement denying rumors that Smollett's place on Empire was in jeopardy.

'The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement.

'He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.'

Media reports claiming that investigators are looking into the possibility that Jussie Smollett may have staged last month's racist, homophobic attack because he was allegedly being written off of Empire were quickly labeled 'uninformed and inaccurate' by Chicago police Smollett is seen above during an emotional interview with Good Morning America

Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted about the reports on Thursday evening

Police took bleach, a black ski mask and an Empire script from the brothers' house

Chicago police Thursday morning that two persons of interest were being questioned by detectives.

Hours later, CBS Chicago reporter Charlie De Mar tweeted that he'd spoken to family of the two brothers, who are Nigerian and were both extras on Empire.

Police reportedly seized a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, five bottles of bleach, two laptops and other items from the home.

The relative who was home when the raid went down Wednesday night described hearing loud banging on the door before police flooded into the home and announced that they had a search warrant.

The woman, who is in her 20s, told CBS Chicago she was 'so scared' and thought she was going to die. She said she was patted down by an officer and asked by detectives if she knew Smollett.

She said that she thinks the brothers are being question because of their loose Empire connection to Smollett and the fact that they left for Nigeria on the same day of the attack.

Law enforcement sources confirmed that the men returned from Nigeria on Wednesday night and investigators met them at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

Reports emerged Thursday that police had raided the home of two persons of interest in the Smollett case who may have been the same men seen in surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above)

Police reportedly seized a black face mask hat, an Empire script, a phone, receipts, five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items from the home

When contacted Thursday by DailyMail.com a CPD spokesperson said the two persons of interest were the same men filmed walking near where the attack happened at around the same time.

TMZ reported that detectives found the men by looking at ride-sharing history records from the night of the attack.

CPD officials confirmed that Smollett was questioned again on Thursday, the same day he spoke about the attack in an interview with Good Morning America.

He told Good Morning America that he has 'never' had 'any doubt' that the two people in the image were the ones who attacked him and that when CPD released their image within the first few days of the incident, he became hopeful justice would be served.

Since then, there have been few developments and the police department has repeatedly spoken of the fact that Smollett did not hand over his phone when asked to do so on the night of the incident.

The two men, whose names have not been released, were filmed near to where Smollett was attacked on January 29 at 2am. They were filmed walking on the same street as the Empire star and getting up after he walked past them on the other side of the street.

To Smollett's despair, no footage of the actual attack has been uncovered yet.

In a Twitter statement on Thursday morning, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote: 'Through s meticulous investigation, Chicago Police detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member.

'These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned. Investigation continues.'

He posted a second tweet within a few minutes which read: 'The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported.

'They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim. '

Smollett spoke about the horror attack in a Thursday interview with Good Morning America

The actor became emotional at several points during the interview as he described how he did not want to seem 'weak' when he finally agreed to report the incident to the police

Smollett also shared new photographs of his injuries which he said included a burn on his neck where the rope was placed and facial scratches

In his hour-long interview with Good Morning America that was aired in part on Thursday, Smollett, wearing a collection of badges to show his support of Freedom and Pride among other causes, revealed his frustration at some of the public disbelief surrounding his version of events.

He said he does not think he would have been met with the same cynicism if his attackers weren't white Trump supporters and revealed his belief that he was targeted because he is a vocal critic of the president.

Smollett also went into detail about why he did not immediately hand over his phone to the police to verify parts of his story and said he was trying to protect private photographs, videos, songs and phone numbers of high profile people and his partner.

He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: 'There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.'

Describing the chain of events once police arrived at his apartment at the request of 60-year-old Frank Gatson, his friend who was at the apartment when the attack took place.

'I told them what happened. I asked them to turn their body cameras off. I was like, ""Please just come in.

'I don't want a big scene with my neighbors,""' he said, adding that he had left the rope around his neck and his bleach-doused clothes on for them to see.

He said that while he left the rope around his neck, it was not 'wrapped' tightly.

After the police had come into his apartment, he took them down to where the attack happened to walk them through it and became excited when he noticed a camera overlooking the exact spot where it took place.

'I looked up and saw there was a camera, directly on the post on the intersection.

'Then the detective told me that the camera was facing north so they didn't have it and that was disappointing.'

Later, he added how desperate he was for them to find footage of the attack.

'I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons.

'Number one, I want them to find the people that did it.

'Number two, I want them to stop being able to say ""alleged"" attack.

'Number three, I want them to see that I fought back,' he continued, welling-up.

'I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,' I didn't,' he said.

He was overcome with emotion when presented with the prospect that his attackers might not be found.

'Let's just hope that they are found. Let's not go there yet. I was talking to a friend and I said,""I just hope they find them."" And she said, ""Sweetie, they're not going to find them.""

'That made me so angry. I'm just going to be left here with this? They get to go free and go about their life and do this to someone else and I am left with the aftermath of this bulls**t? That's not cool to me.

'I understand how difficult it will be to find them, but we gotta.

'I still want to believe there's something called justice,' he said.

Addressing why he did not hand over his phone to prove that he had been on a call with his manager when the attack took place, he said he did not feel comfortable being without the device for several hours when it contained the private information and phone numbers of celebrities and friends.

'They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to our hours. And I'm sorry but, I'm not going to do that because I have private pictures and videos and phone numbers, my partner's number, my family's numbers, my cast mates' numbers, my private emails, private songs, voice memos, pictures, videos...

'Honestly, by then, inaccurate statements had already been put out,' he said, referring to the false reports which emerged in the immediate aftermath of the attack including that the assailants were wearing MAGA hats and that his ribs were broken in it.

Smollett is pictured in the hospital after a friend called the police to report him being attacked. He did not want to involve authorities

Smollett condemned the avalanche of false information and speculation over why he had gone out so late which ensued after it became public.

'I've heard that it was a date hone bad which I so resent that narrative. I'm not going to go out to get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous and offensive.

'Yes there's Grindr... I have not been on that in years. I can admit that I was on that back in the day when I was single,' he said.

If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.

Another falsehood was that Smollett had told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

'That I had said they were wearing MAGA hats,' he said, giving an example of the misinformation that was spread.

'I never said that. I don't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t. I don't need to add anything like that. I don't need to make MAGA hat the cherry on the top of some racist sundae,' he said.

'It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.

'That says a lot about the place that we are at in the country right now,' he said solemnly.

The attackers called him 'Empire f****t n****r', punched him in the face, and told him 'This is MAGA country!' before fleeing.

Trump condemned the attack was 'horrible' when asked about it last month. Smollett said on Thursday that he did not know how to react to the president's reaction

Smollett believes they targeted him not only because he is gay and black but because is a vocal critic of the president who he referred to only as '45'.

'I can just assume, I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration and I don't hold my tongue.'

He said he was stunned when the president addressed the attack in the Oval Office and lent him his support. Trump, when asked about the incident, told reporters: 'I saw it. That's horrible. There is nothing worse as far as I am concerned.'

Smollett was shocked by his comments.

'I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,' he said, adding that he believes he was targeted because of his disdain for the president.

'I can only go off their words. Who says 'f****t', 'Empire n****r', 'This MAGA country,' ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you, and this is just a friendly fight?' he said.

He added he has 'no doubt' that two people in a surveillance camera image that was circulated by Chicago police are the pair who attacked him.

'I was there. For me when that was released I was like OK we're getting somewhere.

'I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.'

He also said he gave police the 'best description' he could after his friend, Frank Gatson, insisted that they call the police around 40 minutes after the attack.

One of the attackers was wearing a ski mask. Smollett, 36, described him as the 'primary aggressor'.

'I gave the description as best as I could. It's Chicago in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody's going to question that,' he said.

He said he had a large stature but could not recall any other details of either man's appearance, saying that he did not even see what color their eyes were.

Last week, police discovered a Chilli Habanero hot sauce bottle which seemed to contain bleach (above). It was found near where Smollett says he was attacked and had bleach poured on him . It was found 10 days after the attack

The Empire actor became emotional as he recalled realizing that they had placed a noose around his neck after hitting him in the face and ribs and calling him a racial slur.

'I noticed the rope around my neck and I said, ""There's a f****** rope around my neck,""' he said.

'I'm p****d off. It's the attackers but it's also the attacks. At first it was a thing of like, listen if I tell the truth then that's it cause it's the truth.

'Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that. It's the truth.""

'And then it became a thing of like, ""Oh. It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,' he said.

He also addressed the threatening letter he received in the mail a week before the attack at the Empire studio which contained a powder police believe may have been Tylenol.

'On the letter it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing to it. The return address said in big red caps, MAGA.

'Did I make that up too?' he said.

It was not the first attack he has received, he said, adding that he had become accustomed to them as an 'outspoken public figure'.

'I get threatened all the time on Twitter and Instagram and DMs and things like that but it's like, you know, I'm a public figure. I am very outspoken. Sometimes maybe too outspoken. But it's who I am.

'So I get the idea of p****** people off, that you're going to rub people the wrong way.'

A week before the attack, Smollett received this threatening letter at the Fox studio where he works

In the initial aftermath of the attack, Smollett received an outpouring of support from celebrities and fans alike who all condemned the discrimination he was subjected to.

But in the weeks since, details of the incident have been picked over forensically.

Some of his neighbors have expressed skepticism that it happened the way he said it did and the lack of evidence has done nothing to quell their cynicism.

They have also pointed out repeatedly that Smollett did not immediately turn over his phone records or his phone to prove that he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when the attack took place as claimed.

It carries special significance because Moore claims to have heard the attackers calling Smollett 'Empire f****t n****r' and shouting: 'This is MAGA country!'

Within the first few days of the attack, he gave an interview to Variety saying he had heard the slurs but he has not spoken about it since.

On Monday, Smollett finally did hand over his records but they were redacted.

Chicago Police Department described them as 'insufficient proof' of the call.

The actor angrily responded that via a representative that he was never told as much and that they were redacted to protect 'personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.'

The rest of Smollett's ABC interview will be shown on Nightline on Thursday."

A local CBS affiliate reported based on sources that police are investigating whether Smollett and two other persons of interest “potentially staged the attack.""

Sources made similar allegations to Chicago's ABC7, which reported that sources allege the attack was staged because the star was being written off of the show ""Empire."" ABC 7 also reported that Smollett did not appear for an interview with police earlier in the day.

Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment denied the allegation that the “Empire” actor was being written off the program.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said in a statement to multiple media outlets. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett has maintained that his account of being attacked by two men in Chicago in late January is true. Police are investigating his account as a possible hate crime. His family described it as ""racial and homophobic.""

Smollett said in an interview Thursday morning with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he is ""pissed off"" over the reaction he has received about his statements in relation to the incident.

“I’m pissed off,” he said. “At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you ... not believe that? It’s the truth.' ""

No suspects have yet been identified in the case, though local authorities announced two persons of interest last month in the investigation.

Smollett's family told The Hill on Tuesday that they were confident police would identify and arrest the actor's attackers.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice,"" the family said.

Smollett has stood behind his account of the incident, and his claim that the attacker said “this MAGA country.”

He said the following in an interview which aired on Good Morning America Thursday:

“I turned around and said ‘what did you say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘this MAGA country,’ punches me right in the face, so I punched his ass back, then we started tussling. It was very icy and we ended up tussling by the stairs.”

“Investigators believe Jussie Smollett and the non-cooperating witnesses in the alleged attack of Smollett last month ‘potentially staged the attack,’ sources tell CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards,” CBS 2 in Chicago reported Thursday. The report was part of a wave of media reports Thursday prompting a response from the Chicago P.D. dismissing reports of a possible hoax attack in the “Empire incident” as “unconfirmed.”

At the same time, media reports raised the possibility that two Nigerian brothers who had been questioned in connection with the incident might be charged as early as Friday.

The CBS 2 report added: “Chicago police raided the home of two ‘persons of interest’ Wednesday night, a relative of those men says. Police took bleach, shoes, electronics, receipts and other items from the home.”

“The men, who are both of Nigerian descent, have appeared as extras on the show and their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, says they do both know Smollett,” the report added.

Schmidt is quoted in the report saying: “They do know Jussie. They have worked with him on ‘Empire.’ My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

TMZ reported that five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items were seized in the raid. TMZ also noted that Chicago police reportedly confirmed that the two men taken in for questioning are the same men seen in a photo taken from surveillance video, which can be seen by clicking here.

The Chicago P.D. later responded to reports of a possible hoax, dismissing the reports as inaccurate. Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the department, sent out a tweet to that effect Thursday afternoon, which you can see below."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack in Chicago in January drew outrage across the entertainment world and beyond. But the attack which was first investigated as a hate crime may have a new angle.

ABC 7 Chicago reporter Rob Elgas tweeted on Thursday that a source said the attack may have been a setup in order to get Smollett attention after his Empire role was being written off.

Smollett claims he was brutally attacked, with racial and homophobic slurs directed toward him by unknown assailants. But according to Elgas, those attackers may have been plotting with Smollett himself to stage the incident.

As The Hollywood Reporter noted on Thursday, this report came after police apparently singled out persons of interest in the attack.

This news also comes after a report by CBS Chicago said the police raided the home of two persons of interest in the attack on Wednesday night. The local news outlet reports that both men are of Nigerian descent and have appeared as extras on the show. CBS Chicago reporter Charles De Mar tweeted on Thursday that he “asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for #Nigeria the day of the attack.” The report also claims that police took bleach, shoes, electronics and other items from the home and that Smollett was questioned on Thursday as well.

This comes after Smollett rebuffed skepticism about the attack following his appearance on Good Morning America, his first public appearance after the alleged attack. Smollett said he was “pissed off” that people doubted his story, but on Thursday that list apparently included the police."

CST: A spokesperson for the Chicago police is denying the accuracy of the reports that they are investigating ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for staging the racial attack with two accomplices.

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,"" tweeted Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi.

""Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" he added.



---

New explosive details are emerging out of the investigation into the claims from ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett that he was the subject of a racial and homophobic attack by assailants yelling President Donald Trump campaign slogans.



The wheels of justice began to grind much more quickly after Chicago police discovered the two ""persons of interest"" that were caught by surveillance cameras on the night of the alleged attacks.

On Thursday, police indicated that the two persons had been apprehended at the O'Hare airport and were being questioned.

They were subsequently identified as an extra on the ""Empire"" show, and his close friend.

Rob Elgas of ABC 7 Chicago reported that police believe Smollett and the two accomplices staged the attack for a very mundane reason.

""Multiple soucres tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack,"" he tweeted, ""allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire.""

— Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019

Elgas also reported in a second tweet that Smollett failed to appear at a scheduled interview with police.

The two men are reportedly of Nigerian descent, and their homes were raided by police on Wednesday evening, according to Charles De Mar of CBS Chicago, who spoke to the families of the men.

The police list of items recovered from the scene include bleach and a red hat.

Smollett had vehemently denied the speculation from many that the attack was a hoax. It appears he will have to answer to law enforcement about those claims.

Earlier in the investigation, a Chicago police representative said that he would face the consequences if they suspected that he had filed a false police report.

Here's some of the Smollett interview:"

Despite reports accusing the actor of staging the attack, police say this is unconfirmed.

Two local media reporters in Chicago, where the incident happened in the early morning hours of January 29, say that police have concluded that the alleged attack was staged.

ABC7 in Chicago’s Rob Elgas reported that “multiple sources” say police are investigating if “Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of Empire.”

CBS Chicago’s Brad Edwards says a source told him that investigators “believe the non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.” The source also says “indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event.”

A spokesman for the Chicago police says, “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

This shocking update comes hours after Jussie gave his first on-camera interview about the alleged attack, in which he addressed those who think he’s lying about what happened."

Chicago police on Wednesday questioned two persons of interest in the Jussie Smollett hate crime investigation, according to reports. Both are African-American associates of Smollett and both were seen in the surveillance video, according to Fox 32 Chicago correspondent Rafer Weigel. Neither is officially considered a suspect — yet.

“After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim & witnesses & transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case,” Weigel tweeted.

This comes after Smollett said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he believes the two persons of interest seen in the surveillance photos were the persons who attacked him. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” he said. During the interview, Smollett also addressed doubts about the alleged attack and broke down in tears over fears that the perpetrators will never be found.

CWB Chicago and TMZ reported Thursday that both persons of interest were apprehended at O’Hare International Airport Wednesday night, according to police sources.

Sources connected to the case tell us the actor, not Jussie, was picked up by Chicago PD Wednesday night right after he flew into O’Hare Airport. We’re told Jussie was brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning. Another man who was with the actor at O’Hare was also taken in for questioning.

According to CWB Chicago, Smollett was also brought in Thursday morning for additional questioning and police have his complete phone records via a subpoena of his provider.

…As CWBChicago reported over a week ago, investigators already had Smollett's complete phone records via subpoena of his provider. — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) February 14, 2019

TMZ reported that the persons of interest are an actor who has appeared with Smollett on Fox television’s Empire and a person who was traveling with the second actor. These individuals are believed to be the “potential persons of interest” who were seen in low-quality images released by Chicago police days after the alleged attack, according to a police spokesperson. TMZ also reported that police used “rideshare and/or taxicab records” to identify the “persons of interest” and to track their movements on the night of the purported attack.

According to CWB Chicago’s source, “Chicago police have known the identities of the persons of interest and believed the case to be staged for over a week,” and have been “intentionally slow-playing the case”:

Update 10:31 p.m. EST: According to CWB Chicago, two Chicago brothers are “potential persons of interest” in the alleged hate crime against Smollett:

• At least one of the men has appeared as an extra on Smollett’s show, Empire, which airs on Fox. That man has a YouTube channel featuring three audition reels. In one reel, he performs the part of a man who has received the finger of a loved one in the mail from kidnappers. • CBSChicago reports that an attorney representing the brothers “expects” charges to be filed against them “before 5:45 p.m. Friday” when the typical 48-hour window of opportunity for prosecutors to either prosecute or release an individual will expire. • The men, who are African-American, shared a residence in Lakeview about three blocks from Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s home as recently as one year ago. One of the brothers also lists a home on the South Side. • Police on Wednesday executed a search warrant at a North Side home, seizing electronics, bleach, a red hat, clothing, and more. The search warrant receipt states that police retrieved proof that both men live in the raided apartment. CWB could not immediately confirm that the raid was at the brother’s listed address near the intersection of Ashland Avenue and Belle Plaine Avenue.

Conflicting reports continue to come in Thursday night with the official position of the CPD contending that local media stories about a hoax are unconfirmed.

CBS Chicago, meanwhile, is reporting that the two persons of interest are brothers and charges are expected before tomorrow night:"

The mystery behind “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack deepened Thursday amid reports that cops are probing whether he staged the attack on himself because he was being written off the show.

Cops raided the home of two Nigerian nationals — extras on the show who are considered “persons of interest” — and took them into custody at O’Hare Airport on Wednesday, according to the Chicago’s ABC affiliate.

The station and a CBS affiliate both reported that cops suspect Smollett orchestrated the attack and enlisted the men’s help.

A spokesman for the Chicago Police cast doubt on that narrative.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said.

“We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” he wrote, though the reports don’t specify the sources are law enforcement.

A relative of the Nigerian men told the network that several cops banged on the door last night and said they had a search warrant.

Among the items recovered from the home were bleach, shoes and electronics.

Police also questioned the star himself on Thursday after the actor appeared on “Good Morning America” to give his first detailed account of the alleged incident.

“He did answer routine follow-up questions from the police today and continues to be cooperative,” Smollett’s rep Pamela Sharp told The Post.

Both Sharp and Fox said that Smollett was not being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off Empire is patently ridiculous,” Fox said in a statement.

Smollett says he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, and walking home from a Subway restaurant in Chicago at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when he was accosted by two people who shouted racial slurs, tied a noose around his neck and doused him with a “chemical substance” resembling bleach.

During the GMA interview, he explained how he handed over heavily redacted call logs 13 days after the attack, on Tuesday, arguing the redactions were to protect “high-profile” friends.

“I have private pictures and videos and numbers — my partner’s number, my family’s numbers,” he told “Good Morning America” on Thursday.

The actor opened up about why he did not at first want to report the crime to police.

“There’s a level of pride there,” he said. “We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak, and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.”

The investigation has been stymied by a lack of security-camera footage — and Smollett’s initial refusal to furnish police with phone records.

While a lack of security footage cast doubt on Smollett’s account, he said that there was a camera near where he was attacked — but cops told him it was facing the wrong way.

“How is that my issue?” Smollett said in the interview. “I want that video found so badly.”"

Police, however, are denying the report.

According to ABC Chicago, the actor failed to appear for a scheduled interview with detectives on Thursday. The report claims that the alleged motive is Smollett’s character being written off the Fox show.

But Chicago police spokesman AJ Guglielmi tweeted via his official account that the report is incorrect.

Smollett has stood behind his account of the incident, and his claim that the attacker said “this MAGA country.”

He said the following in an interview which aired on Good Morning America Thursday:

“I turned around and said ‘what did you say to me?’ And I see the attacker, masked, and he said, ‘this MAGA country,’ punches me right in the face, so I punched his ass back, then we started tussling. It was very icy and we ended up tussling by the stairs.”

According to The Hollywood Reporter, several media outlets are reporting that those allegedly involved in Smollett's case are being investigated with police, who are now looking into an alternate theory in the attack and how it was ""potentially staged.""

According Variety, law enforcement spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, who are believed to have been seen on surveillance images on the night of the attack.

The new information comes on the heels of a report from CBS Chicago that alleges police ""raided the home of two persons of interest"" on Wednesday night, with the outlet revealing that the men were of ""Nigerian descent"" and apparently ""extras"" on the show.

Another CBS Chicago reporter, Charles De Mar took to Twitter on Thursday night, shortly before the report was released to the media that claims he ""asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for [Nigeria] the day of the attack,"" according to THR.

However as of 7:34 p.m. ET on Thursday, Chicago P.D. Chief Communications Officer, Anthony Gugliemli reports that the Smollett incident as being a ""hoax"" is ""unconfirmed by case detectives.""

""Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted by [ABC Chicago] to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,"" Guglielmi wrote.

The information comes after Chicago police on Thursday announced they had identified and were questioning two persons of interest in the attack, which Smollett said occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 by two men who yelled racist and homophobic language before and during his brutal attack.

""The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,"" Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi said Thursday. ""They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.""

During a sitdown with Good Morning America on Thursday, Smollett addressed the conversation about the incident, and revealed how he fought back against the attackers.

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f—, they called me a n—. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

Shortly after the reports, FOX issued its own statement, and voiced their support to Smollett that the attack was not staged.

Two Chicago media outlets reported Thursday that multiple sources told them that investigators believe the attack was staged.

Police spent much of Thursday interviewing two persons of interest in the case, who are believed to have been seen on surveillance images on the night of the attack.

Rob Elgas, a reporter at ABC 7 in Chicago, reported Thursday afternoon that “multiple sources” said Smollett and the two men staged the attack because his character was being written off the show. Brad Edwards, a reporter at CBS Chicago, cited a source who said investigators believe the “non-cooperating 2 witnesses are co-conspirators in a potentially staged attack.”

Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, posted on Twitter that ABC7’s sources are inaccurate.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” he wrote. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said the reports were “ridiculous rumors.”

“He’s been very cooperative and very consistent,” she said.

In a statement, Fox denied that Smollett was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” the network and studio said in a joint statement. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Earlier Thursday, police said they were questioning the two men, but that they were not considered suspects. Local media reported that one of the men had appeared as an extra on “Empire.” Elgas reported that Smollett did not appear for a scheduled interview on Thursday. Sharp contradicted that, saying Smollett did answer additional police questions in person on Thursday.

Charlie De Mar, a reporter at CBS Chicago, spoke on Thursday with family members of the two men who were being questioned. They told De Mar that the men are brothers from Nigeria. They left for Nigeria on the day of the attack, De Mar reported. De Mar posted a search warrant receipt, showing that investigators had found a laptop, shoes, and bleach at the home.

CBS Chicago also quoted Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the two men, who confirmed that they know Smollett.

“They do know Jussie,” she told the station. “They have worked with him on ‘Empire.’ My preliminary investigations show that on set it’s very tight. They’re all very cordial with each other, so they’re baffled why they are people of interest.”

Guglielmi said on Twitter he would not release details of the investigation while the men are being questioned.

“Media reports of investigative details cannot be confirmed at this time,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett’s rep said earlier in the day that he was glad to see progress was being made.

“We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,” she said.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that he had been accosted at 2 a.m. that morning by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, put a rope around his neck, and doused him in bleach.

On Jan. 30, police released surveillance images of two figures who were in the area at the time of the alleged attack, and described them as “persons of interest” in the case. In an interview on “Good Morning America” on Thursday, Smollett said he was convinced that the two were the attackers.

“For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘O.K., we’re getting somewhere,'” he told Robin Roberts. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”"

Empire star Jussie Smollett may have staged a hate crime with two extras because his character was being written off the show, reports Rob Elgas of Chicago's ABC 7, who has covered the case extensively.

Smollett was reportedly a no-show for an interview earlier today with detectives.

Earlier Thursday, TMZ reported that police raided the home of two men who police arrested at the O'Hare Airport Wednesday night. According to WBBM TV reporter Charlie De Mar, the two men are Nigerian and were extras on Empire.

The family said the 2 men left for Nigeria the day of the alleged attack. This is consistent with what law enforcement sources previously told TMZ ... that the men left for Nigeria and returned Wednesday night, and the police tracked their travels and were waiting for them when they landed in Chicago. -TMZ

On January 29, Smollett said he was attacked at 2 a.m. outside of a Chicago apartment building after walking home from a Subway. Smollett said he was attacked by two men in ski masks who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, and said ""This is MAGA country"" during the assault - a claim the Empire star failed to mention in his initial police report, yet said his manager says he heard over the phone.

Smollett eventually turned over heavily redacted phone records to the Chicago Police, after he and his his manager, Brandon Moore, claimed they were on the phone during the attack, and Moore heard the ""MAGA Country"" phrase.

He said the attackers then doused him in bleach and put a noose around his neck, which he was still wearing as he walked back into his Chicago apartment - along with the sandwich.

Questions were raised over Smollett's story - including by Smollett's neighbors.

""I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,"" said neighbor Agin Muhammad who lives in the same building.

""I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

A patron at Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub, about a block from the scene of the alleged Jan. 29 incident, said Smollett’s story “doesn’t really make sense.” “It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said the man, who wouldn’t give his name. “They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?” -NY Post

Smollett's claim prompted widespread support among political activists, candidates and those in the entertainment industry. Democratic Senators and 2020 contenders Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both described the incident as a ""modern-day lynching.""

Jussie Smollett Update: According to @CBSChicago Police raided homes of 2 Nigerian actors who appeared on Empire with Jussie. The police took evidence from the homes and still have them in custody for questioning.



Definitely not the white MAGA attacker narrative pushed by media. — Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) February 15, 2019

Oh, so turns out that maybe the media shouldn't have uncritically accepted Jussie Smollett's phony story just because it fit their phony narrative of Trump supporters. https://t.co/Hxq8E4jo5t — Andrew Surabian (@Surabees) February 15, 2019

Look what we have here. @DonaldJTrumpJr was right about Jussie.

At least one of the persons of interest Chicago Police Department questioned Thursday in connection to the alleged assault of Empire actor Jussie Smollett are linked to the Fox program and both are African-American, according to WGN Investigates.

Additionally, reporter Charlie De Mar is reporting that the two men are of Nigerian descent and appeared as extras on the FOX drama Empire, a show on which Jussie Smollett is a starring actor.

“Police raided the home of two persons of interest in Jussie Smollett case last night. Both men are of Nigerian decent and have appeared as extras on the show. Police took bleach, shoes electronics and more,” De Mar wrote Thursday.

Earlier Thursday, Chicago police Anthony Guglielmi revealed detectives were questioning the two individuals, but said neither of them are “considered suspects at this time.”

“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported. They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives,” Guglielmi wrote on Twitter. “We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”

The pair were seen on surveillance cameras in the neighbor where the alleged attack took place, said Guglielmi.

The report comes as law enforcement continues to probe the alleged assault which Smollett told police occurred on January 29 as he walked back to his apartment from a Subway sandwich shop. The actor said two masked individuals spewed racist and homophobic slurs, doused him with an unknown chemical substance. Further, the 36-year-old told police the alleged assailants looped a thin rope around his neck and shouted “This is MAGA country” before running away.

Appearing on ABC’s Good Morning America Thursday, Smollett said he believes his attackers were motivated by his outspokenness against President Donald Trump and his administration. “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he told interviewer Robin Roberts.

Chicago police said Monday they are so far unable to criminally investigate the alleged incident after Smollett turned over phone records that were redacted. “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” police said. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”"

TMZ reported the pair were stopped by police at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday night.

The ""Empire"" actor, who is black and openly gay, repeated that he was assaulted by two men in Chicago on Jan. 29 as they spewed racial and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi revealed on social media that through ""meticulous investigation ... detectives have identified the persons of interest in the area of the alleged attack of the Empire cast member. These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned.""

The FBI is assisting in the investigation after it was confirmed that an earlier threat was made against the actor in the form of a letter before the Jan. 29 incident."
