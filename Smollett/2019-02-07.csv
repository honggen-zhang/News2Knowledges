Frank Gatson, Smollett's choreographer and creative director, recounted his version of events from the early morning hours of January 29 while on the red carpet at the amfAR New York Gala on Wednesday.

'I was there with Jussie. I'm the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital,' Gatson told Extra.

'Man, that was a scary night — my stomach was numb.'

Gatson said he had picked Jussie up from the airport after his flight got in from New York City on January 28.

The actor, who had been stranded at La Guardia airport for several hours earlier that day, went out to get a sandwich at a Subway near his Chicago apartment when he was allegedly jumped by two men.

Gatson said: 'I'm just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there [after the attack], I was responsible.

'I said: ""Let's call the cops, let's go to the hospital.'""

'Shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable.'

Jussie Smollett's choreographic and creative director, who was with the Empire actor on the night he was attacked in Chicago, recounted how he called 911 and convinced Smollett to go to the hospital after the alleged hate crime went down on January 29

Gatson spoke out about the attack in an interview with Extra on the red carpet at the amfAR New York Gala on Wednesday (above)

Gatson continued: 'It is amazing to me how the white community really supports the LGBTQ community, but it's amazing how some black families would rather their son be a murderer than be gay.

'I hope that my community, the black community, understands it’s people’s business what their sexuality is. I just hope that one day the black community, the brown community, can wake up and support our brothers and sisters who are gay. The hateration is just unbelievable.'

Smollett has reportedly returned to the set of Empire and spoke out about the incident for the first time during a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, which Gatson called 'magical'.

'Jussie is a very strong guy,' he said.

Gatson thanked the Chicago police for their handling of the investigation and called Smollett (above after the attack) 'a very strong guy'

Smollett spoke out about his attack for the first time on Sunday during a performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles (above)

In a video of his Troubadour performance, Smollett said: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately, my friend [filmmaker] Fred Gatson drove me, but I was not hospitalized.

'Both my doctors in Chicago and Los Angeles cleared me to perform but they said to take care obviously. And above all, I fought the f*** back.'

Smollett then paused and stated: 'I'm the gay Tupac.'

The incident report from the attack was released on Tuesday, raising some questions about comments made by the police early in the investigation.

In the wake of the attack, the Chicago Police Department opened Smollett up to criticism by electing to publicly announce less than 12 hours into the investigation that detectives had reviewed 'hundreds of hours' of security footage and not found any evidence of an attack.

The report however shows that only four cameras were initially identified as being near the area where the attack took place.

One of those cameras was located in a parking garage and the other attached to a building across the street, which is five-lanes wide.

Those were also both north of the route that Smollett took home from the Subway.

The same goes for the two other cameras, which are used for traffic purposes and were not particularly close to where Smollett was attacked by the men.

It was then made public that after an expanded search that detectives still could not find footage, yet in the end the image of the two persons of interest came from a camera located less than a block from the scene that was in fact closer than the other four cameras noted in the report.

It was also on the route that Smollett took to return to his apartment.

The two men who are considered persons of interest were seen in surveillance footage walking across the street from Smollett (above) just before the attack

Smollett has never wavered from his timeline, and prior to the attack had been documenting his much-delayed flight back to Chicago from New York.

He posted on Instagram as soon as he landed, just after a midnight, but it is unclear if he had his luggage with him when he was attacked or had returned to his apartment first before going to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway.

Smollett was then just across the street from his residence when the attack occurred, and appeared to be heading into a back entrance of the building that was closer due to the weather.

The attack happened in a below ground street that runs by the building where Smollett lives, and video did show him entering with a noose shortly after 2am on Tuesday.

The proximity to his apartment would also explain why Smollett was so quick to get inside from the cold after spending close to 10 hours in transit that day.

Smollett told Chicago police that his attackers seemed to know who he was before they beat him and tied a rope around his neck.

He also reported that the two men were dressed in black and wearing black masks, and another eresidence at the apoaportment building recalled seieng men who fit that description earlier that night.

The men shouted a Smollett 'Empire f****t n****r' before attacking him in the street.

Smollett is black and openly gay.

He also revealed that he had been sent 'hate mail' at his work one week prior.

The report also revealed Smollett did not want to report attack, but another person believed to be Jackson went ahead and called police.

There is no mention of Smollett having been to Subway or that the men made any 'MAGA' comments in the incident report.

Police have said they would like to speak with Smollett again, who has been labeled a liar by a number of people in the wake of the attack.

At the same time, Liam Neeson has been making the press rounds after revealing he had an urge to commit a hate crime against a black person in response to learning that a female friend had been raped by a black man.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has done little to help the situation, choosing to comment by stating that Smollett's 'alleged statement of what happened' is 'horrific.'

Police meanwhile have confirmed that Smollett is scene walking across the street from the men in the video, disappears for minute, and then reappears with a noose around his neck."

More details about the alleged assault on Jussie Smollett have been revealed by the man who was apparently with him that night in Chicago.

Frank Gatson, the Empire star’s choreographer and creative director in Chicago, told Extra that Smollett had contacted him following the brutal attack on January 29, revealing:

“I was there with Jussie. I’m the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital, and it was so scary man, that was a scary night, my stomach was numb.”

Chilling.

Gatson went on to explain that it was his idea to get the police involved, as Smollett did not want to report the apparent hate crime. He recalled:

“I’m just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there. I was responsible. I said let’s call the cops, let’s go to the hospital, shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable.”

Last week, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing that detectives obtained footage that could lead to the arrests of Smollett’s attackers.

According to the report, Smollett was attacked at about two in the morning. Guglielmi said the actor walked to Subway “just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men.”

After returning to his apartment afterward, Smollett reportedly called his manager — we assume he’s referring to Gatson — who quickly made his way to Smollett’s apartment. Guglielmi noted that “the manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” adding:

“[Units] responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived. He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”

Thank goodness Gatson was there to drive Smollett to the hospital and report the attack. These men need to be brought to justice!

“The president, who’s long been accused of harassing people on Twitter, is today objecting to what he calls Presidential harassment,” Tapper noted.

“President trump is calling it presidential harassment. Democrats are calling it their constitutional duty, telling the president this is his new reality,” Tapper observed. “House Democrats now armed with subpoena power, announcing more investigations into more of the president’s business,” he continued.

The creators and showrunners of the hit television series are praising his strength and attitude.

Here is what they had to say about Jussie's recovery.

Empire executive producer and showrunner Brett Mahoney spoke at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour in Los Angeles.

Mahoney spoke to Fox News about Jussie Smollett's recovery from the brutal and bigoted attack that he endured.

""He's doing well,"" Mahoney praises.

""I think again, he spoke at the Troubadour during his performance on Saturday,"" he notes.

So, Mahoney explains, ""you know he's getting better and he will be.""

""He's not there yet,"" he admits. ""But he'll back to his old self because he's strong and you can't diminish his spirit.""

Mahoney refers to Jussie's statement over the weekend, affirming that he will stand strong in the face of hate.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Jussie affirmed to his fans.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" he assured the audience. ""More importantly I want to say thank you.""

The numerous declarations of love and support for Jussie has been a heartwarming thing to behold.

Jussie gushed: ""The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

Words can really be uplifting, even when someone is frightened, angry, and hurting.

He did address a more negative side of the coverage of him and the vicious attack that he endured.

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread,"" he began.

He concluded: ""I still believe that justice will be served.""

Conspiracy theorists immediately latched onto his story, not wanting it to be true.

Though police released photos of the two suspected assailants, some have falsely claimed that there's no footage of them anywhere.

The truth is that the beating of a black gay man by assailants who referred to ""MAGA country"" makes a lot of people uncomfortable.

It would be more politically convenient for some of Jussie had somehow managed to attack himself.

Mahoney had more to say about Jussie and the brutal attack that he endured.

""The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family – hurt us all very hard,"" Mahoney continued.

""But, Jussie is a proud gay black man,"" he affirmed.

""And I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black, or the pride out of him,"" Mahoney admitted.

""But that’s impossible because he’s strong,"" he noted.

""So,"" Mahoney concluded. ""We’re happy that he is back at work and he’s happy to be back at work.""

Danny Strong, co-creator of Empire, voiced similar sentiments.

""Anything you want to know about Jussie,"" Strong said. ""You can see from his statement when he performed on Saturday night.

He noted that Jussie had come out ""with a statement of defiance for what happened to him.""

""And,"" Strong continued. ""A statement of love.""

Very true.

Strong went on to mention that Jussie has always had this underlying strength.

""And he’s truly a very special person,"" Strong said. ""Which is how he got cast as Jamal.""

This wasy, he explained, ""because we needed someone who was special to play that part, and it was him.""

""So,"" Strong concluded. ""I’m not surprised at all by the class and the poise of his response to what’s happened.""

It's good that, at the very least, Jussie is surrounded by a powerful and caring support system."

The attackers reportedly poured bleach over the “Empire” star and put a noose over his neck. The suspects also were allegedly wearing MAGA hats when they approached Jussie.

Rapper Joe Buddenspoke out about the incident, telling his “State Of The Culture” co-hosts that some of the details of the attack don’t make sense to him.

“Jussie’s story sounds really funny. It’s changed a few times….I’m going to always have a question when a Black man says he had a noose around his neck and he left it there for forty five minutes,” Budden pontificated.

He then went on to reference the hate mail Fox reportedly received right before the attack.

“That ‘Empire’ note…looked like some bulls*t I’ve seen in ‘Austin Powers.'”

Continuing, “I’m waiting for footage. Just show me footage and I’ll shut the f*ck up,” he added.

He went on to suggest a theory proposed on Reddit about what really happened.

“Famous rich people when bad things happen….you cover the story so you can protect your image, your likeness and your career,”

It’s disappointing for Budden to interject his disbelief into such a sensitive, traumatic event without proof of fradulence.

Despite the cynicism around his claims, Jussie is standing strong in his recount of what happened. When he broke his silence about the alleged crime, he told fans,

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he explained.

Continuing, “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”"

According to TMZ, the actor/singer flew back to the Windy City on Sunday and he has already filmed a scene and did a table read, all while security was present.

As previously reported, Jussie claims he was leaving a Subway sandwich eatery around 2 AM on Jan. 29 when two masked men beat him up, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck. No arrests have been made and the case is still under investigation.

The attack came eight days after the actor received a threatening racist and homophobic letter in the mail. Now, the FBI is working with folks on the “Empire” set to track down the person who sent the vile letter.

Sources on set tell TMZ a private security company was hired by the show and met with FBI agents to establish a protocol for inspecting all incoming mail to the cast.

“The security team has 2 functions … to flag threatening, incoming mail and alert the FBI, and to possibly link new items to the letter Jussie already received, containing homophobic and racists epithets along with an image of a noose,” TMZ writes.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Jussie told ESSENCE in statement on last week. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

During an interview to promote his latest revenge flick, actor Liam Neeson reflected with The Independent on an experience in his past, when he reacted with anger and bloodlust after a close friend disclosed she had been raped.

“My immediate reaction was … I asked, did she know who it was? No,"" he said. Curiously, he then inquired about the attacker’s race: “What colour were they? She said it was a black person.”

And then the Hollywood veteran’s imagination took flight: “I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I’d be approached by somebody – I’m ashamed to say that – and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some ‘black bastard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could … kill him.”

Related: Speaking candidly about racism, like Liam Neeson did, is the only way to get past our demons

We do not know what is in Mr. Neeson’s heart today, but there is no way to characterize what he was admitting to as anything other than deeply wrong and hurtful. That he was merely reflecting upon how he’s changed since a long-ago and regretted episode in his life does not excuse his raising of such violent anti-black sentiment. Whatever fallout comes his way as a result of his now-infamous interview is entirely his own making.

But, Mr. Neeson unintentionally did something of a public service: blowing up the poisonous and persistent idea that we live in a postracial society.

It is a useful case through which to examine how black people are imagined and what we should do when people make offensive remarks as a result. Mr. Neeson reminded us how black people, particularly black men, are often imagined in the popular white psyche and become real-life targets for violence. Whether it’s a random attack as in the recent assault of actor Jussie Smollett, state-sanctioned police brutality or the actions of a rowdy white-supremacist mob, black people are often the victims of race-based violence. And that’s increasingly the case: According to Statistics Canada, reported hate crimes involving black people and other racialized groups have increased by 47 per cent since 2014.

Of course, Mr. Neeson’s desire for revenge against a black body – any black body – isn’t new. There is a long and sordid history of this kind of thinking.

D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film Birth of a Nation depicted the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in response to fears that free black men would run amok and defile white female virginity. The Klan’s violence was driven by the same impulse that Mr. Neeson admitted to: the need to lynch black men into submission.

The Central Park Five case in the late 1980s showed how the white imagination, conveyed throughout news media coverage, viewed black youth as prime suspects even though there was little to no evidence to support such claims.

And in 1994, Susan Smith conjured up a make-believe black man who she claimed stole her car containing her two young sons, leading to their deaths. Ms. Smith was later found to have drowned her children.

What do we do when such vile imaginings lead to offensive statements? How should such moments be addressed?

As an educator, I’ve had to deal with several situations where a student has made racially insensitive remarks during a class discussion. In one such case, a student commented on how she would never marry a black man because she believed they were prone to intimate partner violence.

My first priority is to call out such statements and ask the speaker to explain themselves. Most times, students will immediately realize the impact of their words and apologize without delay. I will then check in with other students and offer support to anyone who feels affected.

Earlier in my teaching career, I felt pretty satisfied whenever such issues were resolved in this way. I had demonstrated that I would not tolerate offensive language and was transparent in setting those expectations.

But I’ve come to realize that we often fail to adequately address the harm done to those who have been targeted. In many ways, the hurt is irreparable and permanent, and the classroom stops being seen as a safe and welcoming place. That was certainly the case for my black male students in that particular class, just as I assume it will be for the next black actor who has to work with Mr. Neeson.

There is no perfect way to address these challenging moments. What matters, though, is that we continue to openly discuss racism in all of its manifestations and acknowledge that anti-black racism is deeply woven into the fabric of our collective discourse. Even as celebrities such as Mr. Neeson make spectacular, high-profile PR blunders, it’s essential that we seize upon the everyday opportunities to address such hurtful imaginings head on."

Johnson, however, clarified that police currently have NO reason to suspect the attack was fabricated or even exaggerated, but that the public’s concerns have been heard and will be addressed if they are ever corroborated.

Smollett was initially hesitant to come forward but ultimately reported to Chicago police that he had been assaulted by two white males. The 35-year old singer and actor says that during the attack his assailants yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him, put a noose over his neck, and poured bleach over his head. He also claimed one screamed, “this is MAGA country,” a reference to the “Make America Great Again,” slogan of the Trump campaign.

Finding Smolett’s Attackers

Police have called for the public’s assistance in identifying the two persons of interest that were recorded that same evening on surveillance footage near the site of the attack. They are also tracking down the source of the rope that Jussie Smollett said was used as a noose.

Per the report, a private security company was hired by FOX for the show. The company recent met with FBI agents in order to establish a protocol for inspecting all incoming mail.

This includes the team inspecting all incoming mail and wearing gloves to the evidence in question is not contaminated. The team is being used to flag threatening, incoming mail and alert the FBI and to possibly link new items to the letter Jussie Smollett previously received. The letter had homophobic and racist epithets, along with an image of a noose.

The report claims that the security team has already flagged “hate mail,” but that is nothing new. In the past, the show has reportedly been targeted by racists and homophobes. However, the attack on Smollett has put the show on high alert to prevent dangerous mail and items from making contact with the cast..

Other changes reportedly include daily security sweeps on the set. That includes looking for anything or anyone who might be out of place.

So when I saw the trailer for Jordan Peele’s debut film, “Get Out,’’ I dropped everything, reserved my ticket and, on the night of the premiere, I raced to the theater and anxiously sat through trailers as I plowed through my popcorn.

This film meant a lot to me, not just as a horror fan, but as a black movie-goer, because it was the first time I’ve ever seen a black protagonist that I could relate to in my favorite film genre. But, aside from giving black audiences the representation we craved, “Get Out” identified a piece of the black experience that had yet to be named: the “sunken place.”

The sunken place is a void that black characters were trapped in by the film’s antagonists, where they fell adrift in their minds as their bodies were colonized by white charac- ters. The sunken place is anything but fictional, but unlike “Get Out” would suggest, it’s not a place that black people actively fear or avoid throughout our lives.

In the current political climate, people of color are offered two choices: We can stay “woke,” remaining acutely aware of social injustices, or we can fall into the sunken place. In many ways, this can be therapeutic, as staying “woke” 24/7 requires black people to constantly immerse ourselves in so- cial and political turmoil, which quickly becomes toxic.

I’ll admit that sometimes I fall into the sunken place. I forget harsh political realities and enjoy life unhampered by hostility, which isn’t always a bad thing. However, one can- not stay in the sunken place; in the “Get Out” mythos, one can be snapped out of it with a sudden flash of light. This metaphorical flash represents the jarring events that force people of color to objectively examine society, however un- pleasant this may be.

For me, this metaphorical flash occurred last week, when actor and musician Jussie Smollett fell victim to a violent hate crime. Smollett was targeted by two unknown assailants who beat him, tied a noose around his neck and doused him with chemicals, all because he’s a black gay man. As a gay black man myself, this story suddenly made me very aware of my identity, and the danger that comes with it.

In many ways, this can be therapeutic, as staying “woke” 24/7 requires black people to constantly immerse ourselves in so- cial and political turmoil, which quickly becomes toxic.

Since I heard about this attack, I’ve noticed myself down- playing parts of my identity, or trying to “straight pass,” so as not to draw unwanted attention to myself. By doing things like not painting my nails, wearing less flashy clothes and covering up the things that make me “different,” I fell into a new kind of sunken place.

This new sunken place was no longer a therapeutic one where I unplug from my phone, forget about social issues and just hangout with friends or go to a yoga class. This was a place where I hid my authentic self and allowed fear to control my self expression, much more like the literal sunken place in “Get Out.”

But I was brought of it by another flash of light, when Jussie Smollett spoke out against his attackers. In his first performance since his attack, Smollett told his fans that now is not a time to hide, but to be “blacker and gayer.” This statement forced me to wake up, and I realized that my race and sexuality are among the first things people notice about me — and while I may forget about them in the sunken place, the world never will.

Being black and LGBTQ+ is indeed dangerous. It could make me a target for a hate crimes just like Jussie Smollett was, but it also shapes who I am. His courage in the wake of his attack reminded me to be as gay and black as I want to be, so don’t be surprised if you see me riding a unicorn across campus while blasting Beyonce.

Openly being myself means that I’ll never have a truly safe space, but I’d much prefer that to remaining trapped in the sunken place.

Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson reportedly indicated that the “Empire” actor is still considered a victim in the case but that could change if police learn he had fabricated the alleged potential hate crime.

Smollett claims he was attacked late one night by two men in downtown Chicago who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured an unknown liquid on him and put a rope around his neck. Confusion about whether or not the attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country!” prompted some to question Smollett’s report. Additionally, police were unable to secure video surveillance footage that could corroborate the actor’s story and the 36-year-old actor has also refused to turn over his phone records.

Police Superintendent Johnson reportedly told Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel on Tuesday that the Department intends to follow through if they find Smollett has not been truthful.

The openly gay actor insisted he has been “consistent on every level” with the police, according to an Associated Press report last week.

Fox News National Correspondent Matt Finn reported the Chicago Police were preparing for “possible interrogations.”

In a related story, Weigel clapped back at critics who have slammed him for reporting updates on the case using anonymous sources within the Chicago Police Department.

Weigel’s remarks including DeRay Mckesson didn’t sit too well with the Black Lives Matter activist who tweeted back at the reporter.

No, my criticism isn’t based on “resentment,” @RaferWeigel. I’m noting that you *literally* print *every* thing that the Chicago Police tell you about Jussie & have not indicated that you’ve done any research of your own — just these random PD “sources.” https://t.co/bFzVDmsicP — deray (@deray) February 5, 2019

Meanwhile, TMZ reported Thursday that the “Empire” show has hired a private security company which met with FBI agents about inspecting all incoming mail to the set, following a threatening letter that was allegedly sent to Smollett days before the attack.

“Our sources say the security team has already flagged ‘hate mail,’ but we’re told that it’s nothing new,” TMZ reported. “The show has been targeted by racists and homophobes in the past, but now everyone is on high alert and the FBI is screening all of it.”"

Jussie Smollett's Friend Who Was with Him After Apparent Hate Crime Says It Was a 'Scary Night'

A man who was with Jussie Smollett after he was violently attacked in Chicago last week has spoken out.

Frank Gatson, reportedly Smollett’s choreographer and creative director in Chicago, told Extra he was with the Empire star the night of Jan. 28 and had picked him up from the airport upon his arrival from New York City.

“I was there with Jussie,” he said. “I’m the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital, and it was so scary man, that was a scary night, my stomach was numb.”

“I’m just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there,” he continued. “I was responsible. I said let’s call the cops, let’s go to the hospital, shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable.”

Smollett was attacked at about 2 a.m. in Chicago on Jan. 29.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the statement continued. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

Last week, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released an update on the case, revealing that investigators have acquired footage that could lead to the arrests of the actor’s assailants. The police also released two photos of the persons of interest; however, the images did not show the individuals’ faces.

Guglielmi told PEOPLE he is optimistic that video evidence will surface to help authorities solve the crime.

Describing the details of the allegations as “heinous,” Guglielmi said police had widened their search of surveillance cameras — both public and private — in the area surrounding where Smollett said he was attacked.

“The victim goes to Subway just after midnight and on his way back, he was attacked by two men,” Guglielmi said. “They were masked and wearing black clothing. … They used a homophobic slur. They also used the N-word. They proceed to assault him, and they throw a chemical on him that may have been bleach, and put a rope around neck.”

Guglielmi said the actor returned to his apartment afterward and called his manager, who quickly made his way to Smollett’s home. “The manager goes to the apartment, and they agree to call police. The manager called us at 2:40 a.m.,” Guglielmi added.

Police patrols “responded to the residence to take a report and the victim was still wearing the rope around his neck when they arrived,” he said. “He explained to them why he had the rope around his neck, and the officers closed their body cams at his request, because they were in his private residence.”

Even before the incident, additional security had been hired for the Empire set after Fox Studios’ Chicago offices allegedly received a threatening homophobic letter addressed to Smollett, who is gay, last week.

The FBI, who has not responded to PEOPLE’s request for comment, is investigating that alleged letter, Guglielmi told PEOPLE.

Over the weekend, Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack, taking the stage at the Troubadour in Los Angeles for a scheduled performance during which he addressed the terrifying incident.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” he began. “The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay… I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

“I had to be here tonight,” he continued. “I couldn’t let those motherf—ers win. So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

Clarifying reports about the attack, Smollett said “there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true.”

“There are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick… I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked,” he said. “I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought the f— back.”"

Coverage of the alleged attack on black homosexual entertainer Jussie Smollett will slowly fade into the sunset. Many prominent people in the media and politics have commented on the case, and when it is revealed as a hoax, as it almost certainly will be, their credibility will suffer further damage. It is best to let it quietly slide down the memory hole.

Smollett was supposedly attacked by two assailants at about 2:00 AM on the morning of 29 January. This was one of the coldest nights of the year at minus 12 degrees and a wind chill of minus 20. Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men who called him “Empire f—– n—–,” beat him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and put a rope around his neck. One report claims that the attackers “used their teeth as well as hands and feet as weapons.” Yes, Smollett claims he was bitten. Even hillbillies should know that it is inadvisable to bite a homosexual. When police arrived at Smollett’s residence, he was still wearing the rope his alleged attackers had given him.

Police claim they are withholding some information in order to verify reports from people still coming forward. A Smollett neighbor claimed to have seen a “redneck” with a rope. Unfortunately, this “redneck” with a rope did not fit the description provided by Smollett. An anonymous witness saw a “hillbilly looking” character in the area. How do rednecks and hillbillies dress in minus 12-degree weather? Apparently, these attackers were considerate enough not to interrupt Jussie’s telephone conversation or damage his sandwich. His original police report did not mention the fact that the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.” This was added later.

The Chicago Police Department is not sparing any expense to find the alleged perpetrators. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, “We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area.” The FBI is reportedly also involved. Video footage of the area is being viewed for evidence. Guglielmi said investigators would go “painstakingly” through footage to reconstruct what Smollett said happened. Two individuals have been found on video in the area about at the same time as Smollett’s alleged attack. The video is worthless for identification purposes. For some reason, authorities are interested in whether these people are “homeless or otherwise.” It has recently been reported that Smollett was on camera for all but about 60 seconds of his trip. This would make it almost impossible for the attack to take place.

Smollett said, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.” Smollett did not tell police in his first interview that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett’s manager, Brandon Z. Moore, said that he was on the phone with him when the incident happened and that he heard the attackers shouting, “This is MAGA country!” On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said Smollett had been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.” The Chicago Police Department issued a statement claiming, “The victim is fully cooperating with investigators.” Yet Smollett refused to surrender his phone in order to verify that he was talking to his manager during the attack.

A week after the attack the police superintendent was beginning to show signs of skepticism. He reported that Smollett was still being considered a victim, but if investigators found that he had made a false report, he would be held accountable.

President Trump was asked about this attack during a press conference. He responded, “That, I can tell you, is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.” Was a president ever asked about 13-month-old Antonio Santiago, who was shot in the face at point-blank range in front of his mother, or 12-year-old Jonathan Foster, murdered with a blowtorch, or 5-month-old Andre Jenkins, who was placed in a clothes dryer by his babysitter? These were all crimes that the media chose not to highlight.

The media’s exaggerated promotion of stories allegedly revealing racial bias has consequences. The Tawana Brawley rape hoax, the Duke Lacrosse rape hoax, and numerous false claims of police brutality have enraged members of the black community. The murder of a 7-year-old black girl, Jazmine Barnes, was national news when it was reported that he murderer was white. When it was determined that the assailant was black, it was no longer news."

It is gathered that they are also on high alert to prevent dangerous mail and other items from making their way to the cast.

According to TMZ sources, a private security company was hired by the hit TV series show and met with FBI agents to establish a protocol for inspecting all incoming mail. As a precaution to ensure that the evidence in question is not contaminated, the team wore gloves.

It is further reported that the security team has two functions, to flag threatening, incoming mail and alert the FBI, and to possibly link new items to the letter Smollett already received, containing homophobic and racists epithets along with an image of a noose.

The TMZ sources further reveal that the show has been targeted by racists and homophobes in the past, but now everyone is on high alert and the FBI is screening all of it.

Following Smollett’s attack, there are daily security sweeps on the “Empire” set as guards are looking for anything or anyone who might be out of place.

Production hired two additional makeup artists over the weekend to assist Smollett and make sure his cuts and bruises from the Chicago attack are well-hidden.

It would be recalled that we reported that since the attack that happened in Chicago, Smollett has taken to the stage where he talked about fighting back when he was attacked by the two men.

Smollett returned to Chicago on Sunday after his show in Los Angeles and cops want to talk with him again as a part of their ongoing investigation."

Starring Little Fires Everywhere star Nicole Beharie (as Turquoise) and Insecure fan-favorite Kendrick Sampson (as Ronnie), the feature film follows Turquoise, a former beauty queen and hard-working single mother named who strives to encourage her teenage daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to take part in the annual Miss Juneteenth pageant while navigating love and loss.

Ahead of the film's debut, VIBE correspondent and host Jazzie Belle sat down with Peoples and Sampson—who are also Texas natives—to discuss how the film beautifully paints the characters' love story, what the celebration of Juneteenth truly means to them and the Black community, and what they hope viewers take away from the insightful and relatable film, especially in today's fight against institutionalized racism.

""My hope is that this story will be amplified because it's another Black story about the humanity of Black folks,"" said Peoples. ""And then it will open doors for more human stories about Black folks to be told.""

""I love our culture. I love the way we sound. I love the inflections that we have. I love our accents and how they're different than white folks,"" added Sampson. ""We have to think really about what that [Juneteenth] pageant means and what we are exemplifying within that pageant. And what Juneteenth actually means, and if those are cohesive. What are we fighting for in liberation?""

Watch the full interview between Jazzie, Kendrick, and Channing above. Also, see excerpts from their conversation below. Vertical Entertainment's Miss Juneteenth is now streamable on-demand i.e. Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon Prime, FandangoNow.

On what Juneteenth means to them

Kendrick Sampson: Juneteenth is a reminder that when we fight, we win. We have to take on abolition as a framework for activism that if one person is in bondage, we all are in bondage. It wasn't ever about the person who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No oppressor ever just benevolently gave us something because they woke up one day and said, ""All right. We're going to give y'all back y'all freedom."" It was hard fought for like hardcore radical people that were willing to put their bodies on the line and not just allies, but accomplices.

I grew up knowing July 4th, Independence Day, was bullsh*t because our people weren't independent. What independence were we celebrating? And so Juneteenth is my favorite and it's got a lot more flavor and culture.

Channing Godfrey Peoples: It [Juneteenth] was a fabric of growing up. Is was a fabric of my childhood...For me, commemorating Juneteenth was always about acknowledging our ancestors who Kendrick's talked about who were slaves in Texas getting their freedom late. And Kendrick talked about the themes in the film. And I think I really wanted to portray thematically that Turquoise is on this journey finding her own sense of freedom, by coming to terms with her own past later in life.

On the inspiration behind playing Ronnie

Sampson: I understood who Ronnie was and I thought it would be an honor to portray a Black man from Texas that was different than Nathan because Nathan is from Houston on Insecure. And, that was an honor, especially dealing with mental health issues and such, which I'm hugely passionate about. But just all of us have trauma. I know Ronnie, I got brothers that are Ronnie. And I wanted to honor Ronnie. I wanted to have the chance to show that nuance. I wanted to show that the humanity in it is that, again, you can't be a Black man person, trans, woman, sister, whatever, cannot be Black in America without experiencing a level of trauma and having generational trauma inform how you operate.

On the portrayal of Black love on-screen

Peoples: I think one of the things that I love about Turquoise and Ronnie's relationship is the thing that they have in common. You can feel their history, you can also feel their baggage, but what they have in common is their love for their daughter. And you're seeing them act that out as parents in different ways. Like another question I was always asking was how did these characters parent, and that was driving the decisions for the film. How does Turquoise parent? How does Ronnie parent? And at different moments...you're seeing the yin and yang of that, the positive and negative of both. Both are just trying to love this child."

Various celebrities have spoken out about the violence faced by queer African-Americans, following the attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

Empire star Jussie Smollett reported a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on January 29, igniting a discussion about attitudes towards LGBT+ people of colour.

A number of out stars and allies came together for a video, produced by GLAAD and civil rights organisation Color Of Change in response to the attack, that blames “the rise of the Trump administration” for a surge in racist and homophobic violence.

The Chi creator Lena Waithe, The Flash star Keiynan Lonsdale, American Horror Story’s Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, Moonlight‘s André Holland and Pose‘s Angelica Ross were among the stars lending their voices and names to the collective statement.

Selma director Ava DuVernay, Star Trek: Discovery star Wilson Cruz, Shalita Grant of NCIS: New Orleans, Kendrick Sampson of Insecure, Younger‘s Nico Tortorella, DJ Dee Rees and singer Zeke Thomas also took part.

The video promoted the Call Out Hate campaign, which encourages people to pledge to “fight for justice on behalf of survivors of anti-Black LGBTQ hate violence.”

Lena Waithe among stars cALLING out racist, homophobic violence

In the clip, the group say: “Jussie was attacked because he was black, gay man. Neither of those truths can be erased, nor can we ignore what it means when those true truths collide.

“To live at the intersection of racism and homophobia means black survivors of anti-LGBT hate violence are 1.3 times more likely to experience police violence than their non-black counterparts.

“You come for one of us, you come for all of us. Keep your hatred out of our communities.” — Call Out Hate campaign

“They are twice as likely to experience any physical violence. Twice as likely to experience discrimination. And 1.4 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation during acts of violence.

“Your experiences cannot be erased. Our truths cannot be erased. Our lives must not be erased. We will not be erased.”

‘MAGA America’ linked to rising racism and homophobia

The stars continue: “Since the rise of the Trump administration and this Make America Great Again movement, our black LGBTQ family has been attacked by racists and homophobes and racist homophobes.

“We can no longer pretend there’s a difference between Trump’s MAGA America and the America in which we live. It’s in the White House. It’s in our schools. It’s in our communities. It’s in the courts.

It’s time to put those who commit acts of violence against our communities, and enables of that violence, on notice. You come for one of us, you come for all of us. Keep your hatred out of our communities.

“To all the kids out there, especially black kids, who are gay, lesbian, bi, non-binary, trans or everything, we see you, we love you, and we will fight for you. We got your back.”

Smollett recently addressed conspiracy theories that spread about the attack, speaking about his frustration with “misinformation” about the incident."

They reportedly shouted: “Welcome to MAGA country!” during the attack.

Of course, the more time goes on, and the more investigations that happen, the less Smollett’s claim looks legitimate. Every moment of Smollett’s journey from his apartment to the sandwich shop he visited has a camera pointed on the route, with the exception of a 60-second window where there is no camera, and that’s just where Smollett said the attack took place.

What’s more, Smollett reported he was on a call with his manager at the time of the attack, but for some reason won’t provide his phone to police to confirm the claim. There were also reports of a “redneck” hanging around the area, but there hasn’t been any evidence to suggest there was.

Needless to say, it seems Smollett’s story is getting a bit shaky, even for police.

According to Rafer Weigel of Fox 32, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that while Smollett is being treated as the victim, he’ll be held accountable if he lied and made a false report.

#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 5, 2019

I’m not one to declare Smollett guilty or innocent just yet, but it’s not looking good, and it can’t be dismissed that he popped up with this accusation during a time when the media proved that it’s willing to jump and exaggerate any story they can find where a Trump supporter is proving they’re every bit as racist and bigoted as the left claims they are."

According to sources on set who spoke to TMZ, FBI agents are working with a private security company hired by the FOX series to identify any potentially dangerous mail and prevent it from reaching the cast and crew. The company reportedly met with the FBI “to establish a protocol for inspecting all incoming mail” and the team wears glove to prevent evidence from being contaminated.

The effort comes after a letter addressed to Smollett was sent to FOX Studios just eight days before he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack in Chicago on Tuesday, Jan. 29. The letter, pieced together with cut out letters from magazines, threatened the actor’s life, reading “You will die black f—.”

It also comes just as Smollett made his return to set on Monday to film the final scenes for one of the remaining episodes of the series’ fifth season and to complete a cast table read on Tuesday.

According to the outlet, the team has already intercepted hate mail, though none of it has yet been out of the ordinary. The FOX series has reportedly been the target of racist and homophobic letters several times in the past.

Along with mail screenings, the Empire set has seen an increased security presence, with it having been announced to the cast and crew in an “emotional” production meeting that Fox had increased security around filming locations. The set is now reportedly secured with armed guards as well as daily sweeps of the set to ensure the cast and crew’s safety.

During his performance at the famed West Hollywood venue the Troubadour on Saturday, Smollett addressed the attack, which occurred just blocks away from his Chicago apartment.

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately, my friend [filmmaker] Fred Jackson drove me, but I was not hospitalized,” he said of his injuries. “Both my doctors in Chicago and Los Angeles cleared me to perform but they said to take care obviously. And above all, I fought the f– back.”

The Chicago Police Department is continuing their investigation into the “possible hate crime,” though they have come up relatively empty handed so far. Security footage obtained from cameras near the scene of the crime failed to capture the attack and while photos of persons of interest have been released, they have not conclusively named any suspects."

Last week, Jussie’s sister publicly spoke out and released a family statement on his attack.

During a recent press conference, President Donald Trump called the assault nothing less than horrible.

On Thursday, the President of the United States was asked about the homophobic, racist attack against Smollett by a reporter in the Oval Office. “That, I can tell you, is horrible,” Trump said. “I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.” (E! News)

“He has a really good heart. It’s just hard to know that the world can pick him out and turn him into a monster at any given moment,” she says. “That’s what I fear, that’s something that I carry — I think every black mother does. All parents worry about their kids, but then when you see the news and you see people getting off for killing innocent children with no weapon it’s like, that doesn’t exempt my son.”

The Empire actress also revealed how she prepared her son to deal with the worst of racial slurs. (Her costar Jussie Smollett was recently attacked in an apparent hate crime.)

“You know that N-word? It’s just a word, baby. You can’t let people use words to knock you off your block,” she says.

Henson recalls being asked to arrive at the school dean’s office after her son and another student were called in after a heated argument that involved name-calling.

“And there was a time in high school where it happened. And there was a little tussle, but it wasn’t because of that word,” she explains.

The actress shared the dean read the list of names the two students called each other, one of which was the N-word that the other student called Marcell.

“Then she got to the N-word and she said, ‘The poise that your son showed, he taught me something,’” Henson says. “[The dean] said, ‘Was it the N-word?’ And Marcell said ‘No, that’s just a word. It means you’re ignorant and that has nothing to do with the color of my skin.’ “"

“The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family, hurt us all very hard,” Mahoney said. “But Jussie is a proud gay black man, and I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black or the pride out of him, but that’s impossible because he’s strong.”

“We’re happy that he is back at work, and he’s happy to be back at work,” Mahoney continued.

Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack on Saturday, addressing the terrifying incident while performing at the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” he said. “The most important thing that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay … I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

“I had to be here tonight,” he added. “I couldn’t let those motherf—ers win. So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.”

He also clarified reports about the apparent hate crime.

“Just because there has been a lot of stuff that has been said about me that is absolutely not true, there are just a couple of points that I wanted to make really quick,” he said. “I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately — I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take it easy, obviously. And, above all, I fought the f— back.”

At the TCAs, Strong praised Smollett’s statement.

“I think everything you want to know about Jussie, you could see from his statement when he performed on Saturday night, which was a statement of defiance for what happened to him and then a statement of love,” Strong said. “He’s truly a very special person, which is how he got cast as Jamal, because we needed someone truly special to play that part, and it was him. So I’m not surprised at all by the class and the poise of his response to what has happened.”

Asked if the attack could inspire a storyline on the drama, Mahoney said, “I think a story like this could happen in Empire, just because it is such a timely story. But not as a result of this.”

“We’re really concerned about security for the cast and the crew. That’s the priority,” Strong said. “I don’t know [if it will be a storyline] yet. We’re just worried about him right now, so as far as where it goes, it’s not being discussed.”

At around 2 a.m. in Chicago on Jan. 29, Smollett transported himself to a doctor after he was the victim of an apparent hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that a member of the hit Fox show was involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery.”

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the statement continued. “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck. The offenders fled the scene.”

On Thursday, Smollett’s family released a statement about the attack."

""We wrote 'Chains' because we felt the need to eliminate all separations between us and our music,"" Marika told NYLON.

On Tuesday night, January 28, actor/singer, Jussie Smollett was attacked as he was leaving a Chicago restaurant. Smollet is best known for his role as Jamal Lyons on the FOX hit drama series, Empire, where he plays an openly gay character. Smollett came out publicly as a gay man in 2015 on the Ellen Show, and the unfortunate incident that occurred can only be described as racist and homophobic. According to several reports, he was brutally attacked by white men wearing ski masks, who recognized him shouting “Aren’t you that faggot Empire nigger?” The attackers allegedly put a rope around his neck, beat him so badly as to break one of his ribs, and poured bleach on him as they proceeded to berate him with racist and gender offensive slurs. They eventually left yelling “This is MAGA Country!” referring to Donald Trump’s right wing 2016 presidential campaign slogan: Make America Great Again. According to TMZ, Smollett had received an anti-gay death threat just one week prior but declined FOX’s offer to provide him with a 24/7 security detail.

Immediately after word of the attack reached the public, a wave of support from fellow actors and entertainers, radio personalities, and droves of fans bombarded every imaginable timeline with their love, concern, and support. CEO of Press Release Marketing, Crystal Chanel, joined by popular South Florida Chef, Kiara Hardy (aka Kitchen Killa), appeared on Facebook Live to discuss the matter. In a lighthearted, but informative conversation, Chef Kiara explained why she is not fan of the term “homophobic” as it suggests a fear of gay people, when it’s often so clear that hatred and ignorance are at the root of this violent behavior, not fear. Chef Kiara is a strong and consistent advocate for the LGBTQ Community and took to her own social media to express her disdain around the Smollett attack, and to reinforce the need for Gay/Straight Alliances, stating that the behavior is not simply sad, it’s intolerable. Chef Hardy just recently teamed up with Front of the House, a premiere plating company out of Miami, Fla to host an intimate fundraiser brunch where all proceeds went directly to Pridelines, a non-profit organization offering safe environments for all LGBTQ youth, adults, and allies.

The Smollett Family issued an official statement a few days after the incident: “We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime… these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall.” Filled with obvious emotion, his family describes Jussie as a light that cannot be dimmed. He proved this to be true when he returned to the stage with remarkable resilience for a live performance in West Hollywood, CA on Saturday night, just 4 days after the attack. He quickly clarified details surrounding the incident, telling the audience that he was badly bruised, but his ribs were neither cracked nor broken. Also, he was not technically hospitalized, but he did go straight to a doctor afterward. Still, he did not downplay any of the racial or anti-gay implications of the attack, and he fully supports law officials investigating the activity as a hate crime.

Smollett reassured his fans that he was fully cleared for that night’s performance and was focused on love being the source of his energy and the intent of his words. “I’m not fully healed yet,” he shared. “But I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it must stop. But guess what? It stops with the people who believe in love.” Our prayers and love are with Jussie Smollett and so many other nameless, faceless victims of this brand of hatred.

“He’s an important and so talented a member of the Fox family,” Collier continued, back on Smollett specifically. “There is an ongoing criminal investigation so I won’t go deeper than that except to say it’s been really gratifying to see the creative team rallying around him.”

When pressed, Collier said he did not have any announcement to share regarding another season of hit hip-hop drama “Empire.”

Jussie Smollett

Jussie Smollett has returned to the set of Empire after he was targeted in a hate crime attack last week, as his friend who was with him at the time of the ""scary"" incident opened up about just what happened.

The 35-year-old gay actor was assaulted outside his apartment in Chicago on Jan. 29, when he was beaten by two men, who poured a chemical substance over him and tied a noose around his neck. Police are still investigating the incident, but Jussie is attempting to get his life back to normal and returned to the set of his hit U.S. TV show on Monday.

According to TMZ, Jussie filmed a scene for the upcoming fifth season of the show on Monday, and participated in a table read with his castmates on Tuesday.

His choreographer Frank Gatson was with Jussie at the time of the attack, and told Extra that he was the one who called the emergency services.

""I was there with Jussie,"" he said. ""I'm the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital, and it was so scary man, that was a scary night, my stomach was numb.

""I'm just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there, I was responsible. I said let's call the cops, let's go to the hospital, shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable.""

Frank added that Jussie is ""a very strong guy"", but criticized those who don't understand ""it's people's business what their sexuality is.""

Meanwhile, Empire executive producers Brett Mahoney and Danny Strong also spoke about the incident as they attended Fox's Television Critics Association winter press tour on Wednesday, and told reporters there's a chance the attack may inspire a plot line in the series.

""I think a story like this could happen in Empire, just because it is such a timely story,"" Brett said. ""But not as a result of this.""

Ralph Northam is doing the most to claim it wasn’t him in his racist yearbook photo from Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1984. Now, a former yearbook staffer, who happens to be a Black woman, is speaking out. And she is shutting down that theory.

Photos for individual pages were chosen by each student, Dr. William Elwood, who worked on the yearbook in 1984, explained to CNN. “They were submitted in a sealed envelope with their name on it to the yearbook staff, to be put on their page. The pictures for the personal ones were not just chosen at random from other pictures that might have been available at that time.”

She continued: “Anything is possible, but the probability is low unless someone was out to get him and was able to get access to all this stuff. All of this stuff was kept in a locked room, and the only time the room was unlocked was when somebody was in that room working on the yearbook.” She also added, “as far as I know, nobody complained that their picture was under the wrong person.”

The photograph showed two unidentified men: one in blackface and the other in a Ku Klux Klan costume under a page labeled as Northam’s. Northam admitted on Friday that he was in the photo but did not say if he was the person in blackface or dressed as a member of the KKK, according to the New York Times.

“I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,” Northam said in a statement. “This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians’ faith in that commitment.”

However, Northam changed his tune just a day later, according to CNN.

“I believe now and then that I am not either of the people in this photo. This was not me in that picture. That was not Ralph Northam,” he said. “I intend to continue doing the business of Virginia. I could avoid an honest conversation about harmful actions from my past. I cannot in good conscience choose the path that would be easier for me in an effort to duck my responsibility to reconcile.”

On Jan. 29, while walking to a Subway in Chicago, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited a restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Nine days before, threatening letters were directed at Smollett, reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago. The cutout letters said, “You will die black f**.” See below:

On Feb. 2, the 35-year-old performed for the first time since the attack in Los Angeles. He cleared up some rumors that had been circulating in the media, “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken. I went to the director immediately. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously and, above all, I fought the f*ck back.” The crowd cheered as Jussie paused and then added, “I’m the gay 2pac,” according to the BBC.

He also said, “I’m not fully healed yet but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with y’all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf***ers win! I will always stand for love. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love.”

He continued, “Be as Black, be as proud, be as gay… Now is the time. Be Blacker, be gayer!” See the clip below:

Hopefully, the attackers will be found.

I was by myself; Tony and his daughter were at dance camp and would return in the evening. This notion to propose was so fierce I didn't second-guess it and immediately began looking at non-traditional rings. I quickly found the perfect handmade titanium and lapis ring and ordered it. My plan was to bring it with me on our vacation to Portugal and Spain in September.

In the weeks to come, the ring—hidden in my underwear drawer—became an emblem for any interaction, negative or positive, between us. If we were having an argument, I fantasized about grabbing the ring and saying, ""I even got you a ring, asshole!"" and throwing it. If I was anxious, I'd project onto the ring that it was unattractive, the wrong size, sure that he'd hate the blue lapis, and what a pity it would be when he went to put it on and it didn't fit.

I got on the phone with a close girlfriend, who told me she'd also proposed. How hadn't I known that? Maybe I had known, but in my single days, I just didn't care. I wasn't interested in couples. When reading a book or an essay, I skimmed over the relationship aspects. They bored me then. Not anymore. And what were the odds one of my best friends, who I'd traveled all over with for years, had also proposed? I didn't know anyone else who had.

""I knelt in the snow with two engraved rings when we were walking our dogs one night. They were engraved with 'love of my life'.""

Shit—my ring wasn't engraved. And I only had the one ring. I asked another friend:

""Should I have two rings?""

""I think you can do whatever the hell you want, you know?"" she said. I called some jewelers to get it engraved, but since the ring was titanium and not silver, it was an expensive hassle.

""You have your whole life to get them engraved,"" my therapist said, calming me down.

***

I am a child of divorce, and in the past five years both my parents have remarried. Sometimes I consider how similar I am to my mother and how differently our lives have played out. She married my dad when she was 27 and had lived with him since age 21. Tony is the first partner I've lived with, and I'm 32. I've made a career of freelance writing, but my mom had a steady job and got a regular paycheck from the government. She had never lived alone before getting married; I'd spent a decade living with roommates and girlfriends until I finally made enough income for my own apartment. Needless to say, my mom had not proposed to my father—or to her new husband. My parents divorced when I was 14, flipping my life upside down, hardening my heart until Tony.

It's not marriage I'm scared of, it's divorce, which I know means I'm scared of both because if you never get married, you don't risk a divorce. ""That's one way to live,"" Tony says to me when my way of thinking gets that way. ""In fear.""

Never once did it occur to me to ""wait"" for Tony to propose. Why give him that power? Why give men that power? For another reason to feel subjugated? ""A woman asking a man is disrupting a sacrosanct power that men have held throughout American history,"" Professor Katherine Parkin says in the article ""Why Women Proposing Is Still Rare."" Besides my friend who told me she'd knelt in the snow to propose, I had no examples or models of a woman proposing, aside from Kristen Bell and P!nk. But I'd recently gotten some feedback on a character I'd written into a script for a television show pilot. ""The Chloe character is so passive,"" it said. ""She waits for things to happen to her instead of going after what she wants. She doesn't make decisions."" I took that note and applied it, but to my life.

***

During the heatwave in August, we had a challenging couple of weeks. ""Challenging"" is an understatement. ""Hellish"" is more like it. I was experiencing a going-off-antidepressants chemical crash, the days were 98 degrees with 96 percent humidity. My period arrived, and I bled and cramped like I'd never bled and cramped before. Tony was having allergy attacks and couldn't breathe; I was waking up crying. I felt defeated by the heat, defeated by PMS, defeated by my relationship. I stayed in the bedroom with the curtains drawn.

We went to therapy to talk things out. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" he said in therapy. ""He's right here, working things out with you,"" my therapist said. Slowly I realized that the nightmare week didn't mean we had to break up, it meant we were able to stay together.

I packed the ring in my carry-on for our vacation to Europe.

***

It had been Tony who had made all of the other commitments to me. After hanging out just five times, he looked me dead in the eyes across my oak table and said, ""I'd like to be in a relationship with you.""

""That freaks me out,"" I said, unable to look at him.

""I know it does, but I'm still saying it.""

""I could see us dating… for a while,"" I said.

""Why does it have to end?"" he countered.

Just a week later, he told me he loved me, and I felt exactly the same, and a week after that, he said he wanted to have a child together. I'd been thinking the same thing, and I imagined us carting the baby back-and-forth between our apartments.

""If we're going to have a baby, we have to try living together first,"" he said.

""That scares me,"" I said—not the baby part, but the living together part. But when my lease was up six months later, I packed my boxes and moved two blocks away to his apartment, which coincidentally is across the street from where my dad lives—where I lived off and on in my 20s. ""You're barely moving,"" Tony said. ""You're coming home.""

***

Before meeting Tony, if I was going to date a man, my requirements were that he'd been through a divorce and had a child. On one of our first dates, I saw the book Spiritual Divorce on Tony's shelf, one of the dozens of details of how I knew he was right for me.

""I don't want to go through another divorce,"" I'd tell him from time to time.

""Can you say that same statement as a positive?""

""I want to stay together,"" I'd sigh.

""That's better.""

***

What if he said no? What if he said, ""I'm touched, but I want to work on the relationship more, first."" I couldn't imagine this happening, but I couldn't imagine anything happening as it was a situation I hadn't imagined and couldn't prepare for. It was the ultimate free fall. Deciding to marry felt like exposure therapy to what I am most afraid of, I realized. The only way to heal would be to go not around, but through.

I'd read that when couples argue, they should be standing or sitting at the same level. One should never be standing over the other. I took this tip into consideration when planning my proposal, I wouldn't get on one knee, we'd be eye to eye.

On our first full day in Lisbon, we were jet-lagged and giddy. The Alfama district where we were staying was all cobblestones and hills, romantic without even trying. That night, we dressed up and took photos of each other in front of muraled walls on our walk to find a restaurant. I remember thinking, This will be the last photo of me as a non-engaged woman. My expression looks happy, and a little afraid.

***

After reading about restaurants with ""the best sunset view in Lisbon,"" I had three ideas of where to go, but the first one was closed, the second was full, and the final one didn't look good to us. We'd walked a few miles out of the way at this point, and I felt dumb. Finally, we found a hole-in-the-wall spot that was romantic, and while we ate our cod and olives, live Fado music played as the lights turned down. Across from me, Tony kept telling me he loved me, and I considered handing the ring to him in the dark restaurant. But I had one rule for my proposal: I wanted us to be outside.

Walking home at around 10 that night, Tony remembered we needed toilet paper and went to a corner store to grab some, coming out with one of those black bodega bags. We were walking through a little courtyard that had one orange tree with green fruit poking out of a square in the pavement, tiled buildings, and potted plants, we were sort of trudging, still jet-lagged. Tony was about to go down a long narrow staircase to our Airbnb, and I knew if I didn't do it now, I never would. At the last possible second before his foot hit the stairs, I said, ""Let's sit on this bench for a minute. When do you get to sit on a tiled bench?""

Nerves. Heart flutters. Adrenaline. He put the bag of the toilet paper on the ground.

""Why don't you smoke a cigarette?"" I said, normally not a fan of his casual smoking.

He lit up, and I handed him my phone. The letter began, ""Dear my love, I know I am moody."" It went on to list our idiosyncrasies, like his eating 50 Altoids a day, and leaving receipts that don't need to be saved all over. Then the letter moves to the positives, and ends with ""Will you marry me?""

""Will you read this thing I wrote today?"" I'd written it quickly, basically on our way out the door. I wanted it to be stream-of-consciousness, urgent, and authentic—not poured over and perfect.

He began reading at what seemed like a fast pace. He was smiling. He said, ""Oh my god,"" once and then kept repeating what I'd written at louder and more intense volumes. His body started to shake, and mine shook in response, he was crying and I was crying the most joyful cry I've ever cried. We kissed and I slipped the ring on his finger, a Cinderella moment in reverse. I felt more empowered and alive in that moment than ever. Still shaking, we walked to our Airbnb and uncorked a bottle of red. Tony called his parents and then my mom, saying, ""Your daughter just proposed to me.""

A week later, Tony looked me dead in the eye and told me what I'd done was very brave. We were in a cab driving from downtown Barcelona to the airport. We held hands, his now adorned with the lapis ring, and my fingers, plain, feeling full of opportunity.

When we landed back in the States, cranky after our eight-hour flight which served zero food, we got into a trite argument first about what kind of pizza to order, and then, when we got back to our apartment, another about where the weird rotten smell was coming from.

It felt exactly like coming home. A couple of months later, on a walk with my mom, she was thinking back about her first marriage, and she said, ""I think I was the one who proposed."""

The FBI is screening mail sent to the cast and crew of Empire in a bid to hunt down Jussie Smollett's attackers.

Agents are working with a private security company hired by the show to catch the person who sent Smollett a racist, homophobic letter just days before he was jumped by two men in ski masks.

The team wears gloves as they sift through the mail so that evidence is not contaminated and are on high alert to prevent dangerous items and hate mail from being posted to the cast, according to TMZ.

It comes after Smollett, 35, was sent a letter that read ‘You will die black f**' in cut-out letters and featured a drawing of a man being shot and hung from a noose.

It came with MAGA inked on the envelope in red pen and was sent to him eight days before he was attacked.

Sources say the security team has already intercepted hate mail - but hasn't noticed anything out of the ordinary, as the show has been targeted with racist and homophobic letters in the past.

It comes after Smollett was sent a letter that read ‘You will die black fag' in cut-out letters and featured a drawing of a man being shot and hung from a noose

Security on the set has been ramped up too, with daily checks being conducted to sniff out anything, or anyone, suspicious.

Yesterday, video emerged from Jussie Smollett's performance in Los Angeles over the weekend, including the moment he spoke out for the first time about the recent hate crime that occurred just a few blocks away from his Chicago apartment.

'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately, my friend [filmmaker] Fred Jackson drove me, but I was not hospitalized,' Smollett says in the video.

'Both my doctors in Chicago and Los Angeles cleared me to perform but they said to take care obviously. And above all, I fought the f*** back.'

Back in action: Jussie Smollett spoke out about his attack on Sunday while performing for fans in Los Angeles (above)

Smollett then paused and stated: 'I'm the gay Tupac.'

The 36-year-old actor is now back at work on Empire, and was seen in a video posted by a crew member on Tuesday.

It has been a busy few days on set as the cast and crew is wrapping up production on the fifth season of the Fox series after Smollett missed work last week in the aftermath of the attack.

The show has also been working around the absence of star Taraji P Henson these past few days, who is currently in New York promoting her new film What Women Want.

Cast members have now been given security details to ensure no one else is targeted while working on the show.

The incident report from the attack was released on Tuesday, and raises some questions about comments made by the police early in the investigation.

Scene: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... but I was not hospitalized,' said Smollett (map with inset of the scene where the attack occurred just outside Smollett's apartment)

In the wake of the attack, the Chicago Police Department publicly announced less than 12 hours into the investigation that detectives had reviewed 'hundreds of hours' of security footage and not found any evidence of an attack.

The report however shows that only four cameras were initially identified as being near the area where the attack took place.

Th night of: Smollett posted on Instagram after arriving in Chicago around midnight, complaining about the cold weather

One of those cameras was located in a parking garage and the other attached to a building across the street, which is five-lanes wide.

Those were also both north of the route that Smollett took home from the Subway.

The same goes for the two other cameras, which are used for traffic purposes and were not particularly close to where Smollett was attacked by the men.

It was then made public that after an expanded search that detectives still could not find footage, yet in the end the image of the two persons of interest came from a camera located less than a block from the scene that was in fact closer than the other four cameras noted in the report.

It was also on the route that Smollett took to return to his apartment.

Smollett has never wavered from his timeline, and prior to the attack had been documenting his much-delayed flight back to Chicago from New York.

He posted on Instagram as soon as he landed, just after a midnight, but it is unclear if he had his luggage with him when he was attacked or had returned to his apartment first before going to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway.

Smollett was then just across the street from his residence when the attack occurred, and appeared to be heading into a back entrance of the building that was closer, due to the weather.

Persons of interest: The two men who were seen walking across the street from Smollett (above) just before the attack

The attack happened in a below ground street that runs by the building where Smollett lives, and video showed him entering shortly after 2am on Tuesday.

The proximity to his apartment would also explain why Smollett was so quick to get inside from the cold after spending close to 10 hours in transit that day.

Smollett told Chicago police that his attackers seemed to know who he was before they beat him and tied a rope around his neck.

He also reported that the two men were dressed in black and wearing black masks, and another residence at the apartment building recalled seeing men who fit that description earlier that night.

The men shouted 'Empire f****t n****r' before attacking him in the street.

Smollett is black and openly gay.

He also revealed that he had been sent 'hate mail' at his work one week prior.

The report also revealed Smollett did not want to report attack, but another person believed to be Jackson went ahead and called police.

There is no mention of Smollett having been to Subway or that the men made any 'MAGA' comments in the incident report.

Police have confirmed that Smollett is seen on the CCTV footage walking across the street from the men in the video, disappearing for minute, and then reappearing with a noose around his neck."

Coverage of the alleged attack on black homosexual entertainer Jussie Smollett will slowly fade into the sunset. Many prominent people in the media and politics have commented on the case, and when it is revealed as a hoax, as it almost certainly will be, their credibility will suffer further damage. It is best to let it quietly slide down the memory hole. Smollett was supposedly attacked by two assailants at about 2:00 AM on the morning of 29 January. This was one of the coldest nights of the year at minus 12 degrees and a wind chill of minus 20. Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men who called him ""Empire f----- n-----,"" beat him, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, and put a rope around his neck. One report claims that the attackers ""used their teeth as well as hands and feet as weapons."" Yes, Smollett claims he was bitten. Even hillbillies should know that it is inadvisable to bite a homosexual. When police arrived at Smollett's residence, he was still wearing the rope his alleged attackers had given him.

Police claim they are withholding some information in order to verify reports from people still coming forward. A Smollett neighbor claimed to have seen a ""redneck"" with a rope. Unfortunately, this ""redneck"" with a rope did not fit the description provided by Smollett. An anonymous witness saw a ""hillbilly looking"" character in the area. How do rednecks and hillbillies dress in minus 12-degree weather? Apparently, these attackers were considerate enough not to interrupt Jussie's telephone conversation or damage his sandwich. His original police report did not mention the fact that the attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country."" This was added later. The Chicago Police Department is not sparing any expense to find the alleged perpetrators. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, ""We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area."" The FBI is reportedly also involved. Video footage of the area is being viewed for evidence. Guglielmi said investigators would go ""painstakingly"" through footage to reconstruct what Smollett said happened. Two individuals have been found on video in the area about at the same time as Smollett's alleged attack. The video is worthless for identification purposes. For some reason, authorities are interested in whether these people are ""homeless or otherwise."" It has recently been reported that Smollett was on camera for all but about 60 seconds of his trip. This would make it almost impossible for the attack to take place. Smollett said, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level."" Smollett did not tell police in his first interview that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country."" Smollett's manager, Brandon Z. Moore, said that he was on the phone with him when the incident happened and that he heard the attackers shouting, ""This is MAGA country!"" On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said Smollett had been ""very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us."" The Chicago Police Department issued a statement claiming, ""The victim is fully cooperating with investigators."" Yet Smollett refused to surrender his phone in order to verify that he was talking to his manager during the attack. A week after the attack the police superintendent was beginning to show signs of skepticism. He reported that Smollett was still being considered a victim, but if investigators found that he had made a false report, he would be held accountable. President Trump was asked about this attack during a press conference. He responded, ""That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it, last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse as far as I'm concerned."" Was a president ever asked about 13-month-old Antonio Santiago, who was shot in the face at point-blank range in front of his mother, or 12-year-old Jonathan Foster, murdered with a blowtorch, or 5-month-old Andre Jenkins, who was placed in a clothes dryer by his babysitter? These were all crimes that the media chose not to highlight. The media's exaggerated promotion of stories allegedly revealing racial bias has consequences. The Tawana Brawley rape hoax, the Duke Lacrosse rape hoax, and numerous false claims of police brutality have enraged members of the black community. The murder of a 7-year-old black girl, Jazmine Barnes, was national news when it was reported that he murderer was white. When it was determined that the assailant was black, it was no longer news.

James A. Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose managed to get seven bogus articles accepted by more or less real academic journals.

On the other hand, that seems like a huge amount of work to make fun of self-demeaning periodicals with names like Fat Studies and Journal of Poetry Therapy. After all, the Twitter account New Real Peer Review routinely links to actual published academic papers at least as derisible as the hoax efforts, such as this authentic bit of “autoethnographic” navel-gazing:

Perhaps autoethnography is in part an elaborate tax-evasion scheme to write off whatever the authors would spend money on anyway?

Nobody can deny Lindsay, Boghossian, and Pluckrose one historic accomplishment: They’ve permanently affixed the name Grievance Studies to their targets.

Before last fall, there were a variety of self-designations that only their smartest critics could keep track of. For example, Steven Pinker tweeted,

Is there any idea so outlandish that it won’t be published in a Critical/PoMo/Identity/‘Theory’ journal?

But if you aren’t quite up to Pinker’s level of brainpower, it’s hard to remember that “Critical/PoMo/Identity/‘Theory’” are all more or less the same moonshine.

But now we don’t need to. They are all just Grievance Studies.

Google searches show that the term “grievance studies” appeared only 85 times in the history of the internet before they announced their hoax last October, but 89,700 times since then.

Ironically, the various institutions out to punish the trio of hoaxers for their impudence are just making the term Grievance Studies even more memorable in the highbrow public’s mind.

When something doesn’t have a name, humans have a hard time noticing a pattern. It’s hardly impossible—otherwise we’d never develop names in the first place—but names exist to make thinking easier.

For example, during last week’s frigid Chicago cold snap, a TV actor named Jussie Smollett announced that two homophobic Trump supporters had racistly tried to lynch him. Leading solons of the Democratic Party such as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker rushed to tweet out their unconditional endorsement of Smollett’s story.

Now, it could be that all this happened just the way Smollett has asserted.

But, if you are familiar with the term “hate hoax” and the long history of heavily promoted fiascos stretching back to Tawana Brawley in 1987 in which the national media went nuts over stories of evil white maleness that turned out not to be wholly accurate, you might be a little more reluctant than these presidential candidates to commit yourself to the factual veracity of this latest allegation.

I'm going to need to take a moment to process everything that happened on Chicago PD Season 6 Episode 13.

""Night in Chicago"" was a bold episode that highlighted LaRoyce Hawkins' massive talent.

His performance was layered and nuanced, and Chicago PD is beyond lucky to have him in their ensemble.

Being the only black man on the squad means he's always getting served storylines that involve race and discrimination.

While the storylines are necessary and eye-opening, I fear that it's also causing him to be sorely underutilized.

He's telling important stories, but he's only limited to storylines that find him constantly angry at the system. Can't Atwater ever have a lighthearted moment?

Whenever an episode focuses on Atwater, I find myself with this pit-of-my-stomach anxiety that I can't seem to shake.

Voight: So, I gotta ask Ray, why are you dropping a dime on these two?

Ray Price: Because they're bad for Chicago.

Voight: So is deep dish pizza.

Ray Price: Deep dish may be fattening but it don't destroy young black lives. Permalink: So is deep dish pizza.

Permalink: So is deep dish pizza.

Chicago PD tends to address a topic and then completely forget about it by the next episode, but so much transpired on ""Night in Chicago"" that this momentum needs to be carried over into future storylines.

There are ripple effects that will affect not only Atwater but Intelligence and Ray.

Atwater cannot just bounce back from this and pretend as though nothing happened.

He's been forever changed much like his outlook on his career, his place in society and within his community, and his relationship with his peers.

In fact, I believe the racial divide will continue with Ray's mayoral run.

A political debate between two polarizing forces in Chicago is the next logical phase for Chicago PD, especially as one is running on the Black Lives Matter platform.

Despite Ray's positive message, his motivations were opportunistic and no better than that of the racist cops.

He took a dire situation and turned it into an opportunity to elevate himself.

Ray wanted Phil and Daryl to be ""taken care of,"" but in true hypocritical fashion, he was the first one out there leading the march against police brutality after Daryl got killed.

And then he had the nerve to ask Atwater to lie just so the story could hold more weight and divide the races even more.

Driving a wedge between people isn't going to help the situation nor will it prevent this from happening again.

You and me Hank. We love this city. We dedicated our lives for this city so when people don't treat her right, when they disrespect the very institute that loves her dearly we have no choice but to take matters into our own hands. Ray Price Permalink: You and me Hank. We love this city. We dedicated our lives for this city so when people don't...

Permalink: You and me Hank. We love this city. We dedicated our lives for this city so when people don't...

Ray's mayoral run will also dig deeper into the race war between Kelton and Ray. Both of them have racist predispositions going in that got highlighted during their intense pow-wow.

Ray may be opportunistic, but Kelton is complete scum who had the nerve to blame Atwater for the shooting.

It seems like it's so much easier to blame a black guy who was working to keep Chicago safe and doing a favor for the alderman than to call out the racist cop.

Disgusting.

Voight's decision not to pull the plug on the bust to save Atwater and Daryl was oddly surprising.

I understand not wanting to botch the operation, and I understand trusting Atwater's judgment, but what if Atwater had been shot instead of Daryl?

Man, what's wrong with you? You look like you write songs for Drake. All up in your feelings, ain't you? Atwater Permalink: Man, what's wrong with you? You look like you write songs for Drake. All up in your feelings,...

Permalink: Man, what's wrong with you? You look like you write songs for Drake. All up in your feelings,...

Did that thought even cross Voight's mind?

Voight intentionally put his own man at risk for what reason?

I shook my head when he questioned Atwater's assessment that the cop ""wasn't one of them"" saying he couldn't judge a cop without seeing proof.

Um, was Voight not listening to the audio like everyone else?

I also wonder why the FOP reps didn't care to question the rest of Intelligence as they all heard what was happening while standing by.

It wouldn't have just been Atwater's word against a white cop, his team could and would have backed him up.

Now, this episode is difficult for me to review because I'm a white woman. Just like Ruzek mentioned, I get it, but I'll never personally get it.

Atwater: What are you saying?

Ruzek: It's tough to say because I'm white. And no matter how hard I try or how badly I want to understand what just happened, what you just experienced, I can't. I never will. But I got your back always. Either way I got your back. Permalink: It's tough to say because I'm white. And no matter how hard I try or how badly I want to...

Permalink: It's tough to say because I'm white. And no matter how hard I try or how badly I want to...

And that's okay.

I can still acknowledge that targeted police brutality on black men is real and wrong.

However, this episode transgressed police brutality; it also touched on dirty politics, discretion, and acceptance, which is why it was so powerful and resonated with such a large audience.

But frankly, the most challenging part of this episode is the difficult subject matter and the fact that there was no right or wrong answer.

Atwater struggled so much under the weight of his final decision because he has a conscience and a moral obligation to both his community and his team.

The way Atwater and Daryl got treated was undoubtedly racially motivated.

But the shooting? It was a good shot. It was warranted because Daryl resisted arrest and charged at an officer.

Resisting arrest always has negative outcomes regardless of what transpired to get to that moment.

Voight: You gotta do what you think is right. Just keep in mind, you're a cop. That's what you get paid for not to change the world.

Atwater: I just thought that's what we were supposed to do. Make the world better.

Voight: Just remember this is Chicago. It's not easy to be an idealist.

Permalink: Just remember this is Chicago. It's not easy to be an idealist.

Permalink: Just remember this is Chicago. It's not easy to be an idealist.

The situation should have never escalated that far, but once it did, Daryl should have complied.

Then there's the argument of whether or not Daryl was a good guy.

He may have been innocent at the time of the shooting, but overall he was a danger to Chicago by ""destroying young black lives.""

Did he deserve to die for dealing drugs? No. Did he deserve to die for driving while being black? Hell no.

But in a world where we have to save face, it's easier to spin his death since he has a criminal history.

Delving even further, was it Daryl's fault that he wasn't a good guy?

That's a complex answer. One could argue that we all have a choice, but losing your father at a young age, living in a low-income neighborhood, and being forced to turn to the streets, violence, and drugs for survival leaves you without much of one.

Sadly, it's a vicious circle that isn't easily broken especially with a system in place that's working against you.

Voight: You gotta take some time and calm down. Make sense of all this.

Atwater: No thanks, Sarge. I don't wanna calm down. I don't wanna make sense of this cause what just happened can't keep happening. Nah, it's gotta stop. Permalink: No thanks, Sarge. I don't wanna calm down. I don't wanna make sense of this cause what just...

Permalink: No thanks, Sarge. I don't wanna calm down. I don't wanna make sense of this cause what just...

Then there's Atwater's guilt of turning on his people even though they weren't technically good people.

I don't think there will ever be a moment where Atwater can do good by both his brothers and his brothers in blue.

I was surprised none of Daryl's family -- specifically, his brother Vance -- went after Atwater after finding out he was a cop who betrayed them!

I'd say this episode was ridiculously upsetting and tragic, but it was more exhausting because when all is said and done, it's another day, or in this case, night, in Chicago.

I also can't help but point out the timing of this episode.

Just last week Empire's Jussie Smollett got attacked in the streets of Chicago for being a gay, black man.

Chicago PD may be a show, but the situations they are portraying and the hate crimes they are dealing with are far too real and crucial.

Atwater must be commended for following his gut instinct and telling the board the truth -- that it was a good shot.

If he doesn't have his honesty and integrity, what does he have?

However upset you were with his decision or that justice wasn't served, the ending made up for it.

I spent the whole episode waiting for that cop to get what was coming to him.

He wasn't so high and mighty without his badge or his gun.

Ruzek: Is the video helping or hurting?

Atwater: The video can't hear what the punk-ass cop was saying. I blink the wrong way that white boy would have shot me. Permalink: The video can't hear what the punk-ass cop was saying. I blink the wrong way that white boy...

Permalink: The video can't hear what the punk-ass cop was saying. I blink the wrong way that white boy...

Atwater placing the gun to his head and asking if he feels like a man now gave me pure joy.

That is my favorite version of Atwater.

That is the version of Atwater I need in episodes to come.

I know this episode probably stirred up a lot of emotions in you (as it should have); it's a heavy situation.

We'll see where Atwater's narrative takes him now that he isn't exactly sure CPD has his back as a black man.

Kelton could still throw him under the bus to secure his mayoral title.

Do you think Atwater will join Ray's campaign? Will he reconsider being a cop?

Jussie Smollett performed a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood over the weekend. It was his first public appearance since he was allegedly attacked in Chicago earlier in the week.

Before singing a note, Smollett talked to the crowd about the alleged attack in which two masked men punched him in the face, poured bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck, and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett said those close to him didn’t even want to do the concert, but he said he had to go on with the show because he refused to let his attackers win.

“The most important thing that I can say is to keep it simple and say thank you and I’m okay,” Smollett said to the cheering crowd. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to and I’m going to stand strong with you all. I had to be here tonight. I couldn’t let those motherf**kers win.”

He added: “I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.:”

Near the end of his concert, Smollett spoke to the crowd of about 400 people again to clear up a few things about his alleged attack.

He said he was bruised, but his ribs were not cracked. Immediately following the incident, he went straight to the doctor, but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to perform, but advised him to be careful, for obvious reasons.

“And above all, I fought the f**k back,” he said as the audience erupted into cheers. “I’m the gay Tupac!”

Police haven’t made any arrests, and they said they haven’t been able to find surveillance video of the attack, though they did see footage of Smollett walking home with a rope around his neck. They also released blurry photos showing the two “persons of interest.”

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative throughout their investigation and they have no reason to believe he’s not being genuine."

Virginity is vastly overrated—and I say that as someone who held onto at least portions of his far longer than most (although I made up for lost time). I also think that virginity might cause at least partial mental instability. Two popular shows on network television currently feature high-profile virgins. One is dumb as a stump, and the other is batshit crazy. I don't mean to disparage either of these people, but I believe perhaps their celibacy has played at least some part in their tenuous grasp on reality. So the next time someone proposes something beyond your level of expertise, give it a try. It may actually help...even if initially it hurts.

If there's one thing that works out less often than being a virgin, it's being in a throuple. And I'm not talking about casual encounters, in which case I say the more, the merrier. But if you think being in a relationship with one person is hard, try two. Frankie Grande tried his share of combinations before going public around Halloween as being the proverbial third wheel to a very hot couple. Apparently it wasn't all smooth sailing. ""You have double the highs, double the excitement, but also double the lows, double the drama."" Those heady days have passed. ""I am single. I've been single for about a month now."" Probably spending most of his time in a sitz bath!

Since this column is being filed on Super Bowl Sunday, one would think this proud Bostonian living in LA would be watching. And I am—but primarily to see the cheerleaders. Although I have a personal connection with someone cheering for the Pats, it's the Los Angeles Rams that are making history. This will be the first Super Bowl to feature male cheerleaders! Last year, Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies auditioned or tried out or whatever one does to become a cheerleader. They not only joined the LA Rams squad, they're at the Super Bowl. Congrats.

The big gay story last week was the attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett. I was kinda shocked at the reaction. First, some of my dearest childhood friends questioned if the attack really took place, or if Jussie was simply looking for publicity. ""Something doesn't ring true,"" one said on Facebook. Yeah, because if I were looking for publicity, I'd tie a noose around my neck and douse myself in bleach! Then someone pointed out to me the social media posts by organizations that used this attack as an opportunity to promote themselves. Shameful.

As of the writing of this column, here's what we know. On the evening of Monday, January 28th, Jussie had flown from New York to Chicago—where ""Empire"" shoots and where Smollett has an apartment. Around 2AM, he was hungry and went to a 24-hour Subway (and, if I might inject a bit of levity into this difficult story, let me note that nothing good happens at a Subway at 2AM). When he left the Subway (presumably with his sub), two white men wearing ski masks approached him and yelled out, ""Aren't you that f*&%t 'Empire' n*&%r?"" They then attacked Jussie, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him, saying ""This is MAGA country"" as they ran away. After reporting the crime to the police, Jussie got himself to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he was treated for a fractured rib. A couple of days later, Chicago Police released a photo of ""persons of interest"" that shows two men on a neighboring street around the time of the attack.

I will admit, all of this raises several questions—who is walking around Chicago at 2AM with a noose and bleach? There is speculation that Smollett was targeted, as he had earlier received a letter which was sent to the ""Empire"" set and threatened, ""You will die black fag,"" with a return address that simply said ""MAGA"". Also, a woman who lives in Smollett's building says that when she took her dog out to pee at 12:30AM, she saw a suspicious man lingering. On the flip side, Smollett says that at the time of the attack, he was talking to his manager on his cell phone. So, the police asked to examine the phone—Jussie declined. Police say he was not obligated to share the handset or phone records. And, frankly, as a gay man, I don't think I'd want the fuzz looking into the bowels of my mobile, either.

BTW, Smollett had a concert scheduled for February 2nd at the legendary Troubadour in West Hollywood. Despite some concerns, the concert took place, although the scheduled meet-and-greet was cancelled. ""I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to and I'm going to stand strong with you all,"" Jussie told the capacity crowd. ""I had to be here tonight. I couldn't let those motherfuckers win! So I will also stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.""

One of the people speaking out on Smollett's behalf has been ""Empire"" creator Lee Daniels. ""It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son. You didn't deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called 'die faggot nigga' or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist f- can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I'm with you. I'll be there in a minute. It's just another fucking day in America.""

Lee Daniels also has some good news to share. ""Y'all remember maybe 10, 12 years ago I said my dream was to make a gay superhero film? Dreams do come true. And I found my superhero."" Wouldn't it be a heartwarming moment if I then told you that the gay superhero would be played by Jussie Smollett? If this were a movie on the Hallmark Channel, that's exactly what would happen—of course, all of the characters would be played by white folk. Apparently Lee saw a video of 19-year-old Dremon Cooper and offered him the lead. Stay tuned.

I don't regularly watch ""Flipping Out"". In fact, I try to avoid it. So, I didn't realize Jeff and Gage were not married—but who cares? If straights can have kids out of wedlock and be sued by their surrogates, why not gays? I found out the couple wasn't married because Jeff announced that Gage had moved out last week. He says that for most of the past year, Gage had been in a separate bedroom and the two have primarily been friends with benefits—the benefit, if you ask me, is that you get your own room! I don't have a dog in this fight (no offense), but I'd like to make one general observation: one doesn't marry a Gage. One has meaningless sex with a Gage. Hot, meaningless, nasty sex. Like, I once slept with someone named Brick. I can't swear that was his real name—I never checked his papers. The Gages and Bricks of the world are the guys you fool around with in the bathroom while your boyfriend is waiting at the table in the restaurant. You want a drama-free life? Marry someone with a name out of the Bible. Except Lazarus—every time you think you're done, he'll spring back to life and you'll never get any sleep.

There's some drama surrounding the estate of Aretha Franklin—and by estate, we mean her actual estate. An attorney for one of her sons said, ""I have no detail on anything missing pre- or post-Aretha's death. The house has high security and everyone was locked out unless escorted, post-death."" Curious wording. Then I read that Bloomfield Township police launched the probe back in June—two months BEFORE Aretha's death. Hmmm. Complicating things is an outstanding IRS bill dating back to December 2012. Yet another attorney—this time, for the estate—claims that over $3 million in back taxes has been paid since Aretha's death. That may sound like a lot, but we hear that with penalties, the total bill is closer to $8 million. Since Aretha had a long-lingering illness, the big question is why didn't she write a will to protect her $80 million fortune? Being intestate leaves many things up in the air. The attorney for the estate said, ""There is a dispute between the estate and Ms. Franklin's ex-husband, the father to one of the heirs, regarding music royalties."" This is probably her first husband, Ted White, who at one time was also Aretha's manager. I suspect we haven't heard the last of this story.

Could it be that one of the contestants on ""Celebrity Big Brother"" has a secret? Well, they all do—but one of them has a health secret...and it's a doozy. In fact, he (there are so few ""he's"" left) kept it a secret from the producers, and even bluffed his way through the pre-show physical. All will be revealed...but in the privacy of a bathroom.

When we're dishing on famous houseguests' health, it's time to end yet another column. And still, my 50th birthday looms. February 13th is right around the corner, but there won't be much time for celebrating—at least not on one coast. The next day, I'll be off to NYC to assist Jenifer Lewis in her American Songbook concert at Lincoln Center on February 15th. But whether I'm hither or yon, you can get all of the best dish on www.BillyMasters.com—the site that's more than a bit bi. As always, send your queries to Billy@BillyMasters.com and I promise to get back to you before I reclaim my virginity. So, until next time, remember, one man's filth is another man's bible.

A theater critic once left a play at intermission and submitted a review as if he’d seen the whole thing, only to be caught out because the theatre burned down during the second act. Despite such a cautionary tale, I feel confident in offering this thumbnail review of Trump’s 2019 State of the Union in advance: he lied a lot, insulted everyone’s intelligence, and made it all about himself.

Trump’s mischief requires many helpers. Let’s consider a few. Mitch McConnell is like a man who sees his toddler reaching for a loaded handgun on the coffee table and does not stop him lest he throw a tantrum. Roger Stone, who threatened radio host Randy Credico’s therapy dog and said, “Prepare to die,” claims that the FBI treated him “worse than bin Laden.” Wouldn’t that have made him the late Roger Stone? Sarah Huckabee Sanders says that Trump was chosen by God. I can’t say we don’t have it coming, but I doubt Sanders meant that in the same spirit as Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time.

The 2020 campaign has hardly begun and already we are awash in caricatures of progressivism, peppered with comparisons to Venezuela and scoldings by deficit hawks who were strangely silent in the face of ruinous tax cuts for the wealthy and new splurging on our massive military.

Venezuela’s problem is not socialism but a corrupt autocrat. Munitions cannot make up for having a Russian asset in the White House whose daughter won trademarks from China amid trade negotiations. Trump reflexively rejected his intelligence chiefs’ public testimony on the top international threats, none of which involved our border with Mexico. He then withdrew America from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. “Only Russia benefits from the US withdrawal,” writes Richard A. Clarke, who helped design the accord.

We are being conned and endangered, yet often our response is liberal infighting caused not only by competing ambitions (which are all in the game), but by unresolved issues and lack of courage in our convictions.

One problem is the blind arrogance of privilege that impedes cooperation. It oozes, for example, from a planned monument marking the 2020 centennial of the 19th Amendment. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who erased contributions by black women in their six-volume History of Woman Suffrage, are to be honored with a Central Park sculpture in which they are reviewing a scroll of suffragists. Their century-old belief that race and gender were separate issues, and their paternalistic entitlement, are recapitulated in the sculpture’s design.

Even now, many people scorn intersectional activism, whether out of ideological considerations, aesthetic distaste, or eagerness to house their concerns in separate silos from others. How is that working? Progress on a range of issues is being rolled back by a president whose power is based on dividing us.

Trump has no moral authority when he condemns the racist and homophobic assault against Empire star Jussie Smollett, or criticizes Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s obtuse and contradictory statements regarding a racist yearbook photo from 1984. Trump discriminated against black tenants; attacked the Central Park Five even after they were proved innocent; launched his presidential campaign with a racist smear of Mexicans; won election in part by the suppression of black votes; and failed to rebuke violent Nazis after Charlottesville. An arsonist does not become a firefighter by changing hats.

Trump’s deflections often rely on false equivalency. Northam’s policy record, for instance, is a good deal better than that old photo suggests. His positive actions ought not be erased amid the pressure to resign, by which Democrats demonstrate higher standards.

But let us pause and reflect. The tragedy for our nation is not in Trump’s incitements, but their success.

POTUS talks of unity while attacking America’s highest values and traditions. This is a time not for losing our nerve and conceding to fear, but upholding a better vision for our country. Caricatures of Democrats as radicals need not prevent us from connecting with voters’ imaginations. In our diversity we bring a wealth of gifts, which can bear fruit if only we summon the courage to welcome them and not be threatened by their cultivation. The work awaits us.

The producers of “Empire” are fired up about star Jussie Smollett, who was the recent victim of an alleged hate crime.

“Jussie is a proud gay black man… and if the attackers thought they could beat the gay, the black, or the pride out of him, it’s impossible,” said “Empire” showrunner Brett Mahoney at the Television Critics Association press tour Wednesday.

Smollett, who is openly gay and plays gay singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on “Empire,” was hospitalized in late January in Chicago after an assault by two men. According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, Smollett was approached by two “unknown offenders,” who “yelled racial and homophobic” slurs at the actor. The attackers then began to “batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.” Later, one of the assailants “wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

His family released a statement condemning the attack as a “racial and homophobic hate crime,” which the police are investigating. The actor appeared several days later to perform at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. Holding back tears, he told the crowd that he was still healing and that he will “always stand for love.”

“Empire” co-creator Danny Strong said that Smollet is happy to be back at work, following a brief hiatus to accommodate the cold weather in Chicago.

“He is truly a very special person,” Strong said. “That is [why] we cast him as Jamal… We’re not surprised by his class and poise.”

Meanwhile, newly minted Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier wouldn’t confirm whether or not “Empire” would be renewed for another season: “We’re not announcing pick-ups today.”

Collier, who was previously AMC’s president and general manager, also pointed out that he couldn’t comment too much on the attack itself since it’s an “ongoing criminal investigation.”

But, he added, “My heart goes out to Jussie and everyone involved. It’s a tragic thing. He’s an important and so talented member of the Fox family. It’s been gratifying to watch the creative community rally around him.”

Johnson said that police have no reason to suspect that Smollett invented the attack or exaggerated his account of it, but the possibility of a hoax could lead to criminal consequences for the television star.

""#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable,"" reported Rafer Weigel of Fox-32 Chicago.

Smollett told police that he had been assaulted by two white males who yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him, put a noose over his neck, and poured bleach him. He also claimed one yelled, ""this is MAGA country,"" a reference to the slogan of the Trump campaign.



Some on social media have cast aspersions on his claims, but the police have indicated that they are treating the report as serious while they investigate.

Police have asked for help from the public in identifying two persons of interest that were caught on surveillance recordings near the site of the attack on the same night. They are also investigating the source of the rope that Smollett said his attackers used.

""He's doing well,"" Mahoney told Fox News during the Fox portion of the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour in Los Angeles. ""I think again, he spoke at the Troubadour during his performance on Saturday that you know he's getting better and he will be. He's not there yet, but he'll back to his old self because he's strong and you can't diminish his spirit.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told officers that he was accosted while walking to his apartment by two men who called him an ""Empire f----t [n-word]."" Smollett then said the men beat him and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him, staining his clothes. The report said that when responding officers arrived, Smollett had a white rope draped around his neck.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT ATTACK INVESTIGATORS WITHHOLDING SOME INFORMATION UNTIL THEY HAVE 'ALL THEIR DUCKS IN A ROW'

Last Friday, Smollett — who returned to work on Monday, as TMZ reported — spoke out for the first time to let fans know he's ""OK.""

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said at the time. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" the 36-year-old actor stated.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT PERFORMS AT EMOTIONAL CONCERT, MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE SINCE ATTACK

On Monday, police said they had located additional surveillance cameras in the area where Smollett said he was attacked. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the footage from those cameras was being ""downloaded and reviewed"" and that police were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Earlier in Wednesday's Television Critics Association panel, Mahoney explained how the alleged attack on Smollett hurt the ""Empire"" family ""very hard.""

“The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family – hurt us all very hard,"" Mahoney explained. ""But, Jussie is a proud gay black man, and I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black, or the pride out of him, but that’s impossible because he’s strong. So, we’re happy that he is back at work and he’s happy to be back at work.”

Co-creator Danny Strong echoed Mahoney's sentiments stating: ""Anything you want to know about Jussie, you can see from his statement when he performed on Saturday night – with a statement of defiance for what happened to him and a statement of love.

""And he’s truly a very special person, which is how he got cast as Jamal because we needed someone who was special to play that part, and it was him,"" Strong continued. ""So, I’m not surprised at all by the class and the poise of his response to what’s happened.”
