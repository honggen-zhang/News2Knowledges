A grand jury on Friday indicted the Empire actor on 16 felony counts related to his alleged staging of an attack on himself in Chicago, reports NBC News. Smollett already had been charged with one felony count of filing a false report. The new charges cover what Smollett initially told officers as well as what he said during a follow-up interview, reports ABC7 Chicago, which adds that Smollett is expected to strike a plea deal to avoid spending time in prison. Meanwhile, the fallout from the case widens. CBS Chicago reports that ""dozens"" of staffers at Northwestern Hospital may have been fired for improperly reviewing Smollett's medical records from the night he was brought there.

The hospital is not commenting on the TV station's report, but one unnamed nurse says she was among those fired. However, she says she merely scrolled past Smollett's medical records while looking up another patient and will contest the firing. The Chicago Police Department, meanwhile, has opened a separate investigation to try to figure out who within the department has been leaking news about Smollett to the press, reports Deadline. As for the next legal steps, Smollett's arraignment hearing is set for March 14. According to the new indictment, when he told police about the alleged attack, Smollett ""knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” per CBS Chicago.

The Black Bears will take a 5-26 record into an America East quarterfinal at top-seeded Vermont (24-6) at 7 p.m. Saturday.

That’s one fewer win in Coach Richard Barron’s first season than Maine had last year under Bob Walsh, and on a par with Walsh’s four-year mark of 24-100.

But those close to the program have seen growth this season. There have been fewer blowout losses. Fourteen losses have been by less than 10 points, three in overtime. The overhauled roster is expected to be stronger next season under Barron, the former UMaine women’s coach.

“We’re not missing great plays or talent,” Barron said. “What we’re missing is discipline just to do the simple things over and over.”

In Tuesday’s 60-53 loss at New Hampshire, that translated into Maine defenders continually trying to double-team the high post, which opened up UNH’s 3-point shooters. Maine’s nine-point lead with eight minutes to play disappeared rapidly.

“We’re not a very mature team. Regardless of our age, everybody is new in this system,” Barron said.

It didn’t help that Maine was without its leading scorer and rebounder, injured junior forward Andrew Fleming, a former Oxford Hills standout who was named to the America East all-conference second team Friday.

Fleming broke his arm and suffered a concussion after a terrifying fall when he was fouled from behind on a breakaway dunk Feb. 23 at Stony Brook.

Fleming was asked what Maine needs to take the next step and turn late-game leads into wins.

“I think we’ve taken it. You might not see it necessarily this year,” he said. “We’re getting really close. We’re doing much better than last year. We’ve held leads for the majority of the game. We’ve just got to keep working and keep growing.”

One reason for optimism is some of the talent influx is already on a roster that includes players from 12 countries and five continents.

Mykhailo Yagodin, a 6-foot-5 sophomore guard from Odessa, Ukraine, who Barron called “maybe our best scorer, our best shooter,” tore his ACL in the opener at Denver. Solomon Iluyomade, a 6-7 sophomore forward from London, also suffered a season-ending injury in that game. Redshirt freshman Stephane Ingo, a 6-9 center from Canada with a 7-3 wingspan, and 6-8 Nedeljko Prijovic, who had to sit out a season after transferring from Texas State, practiced with the Black Bears all season and will be in the mix next winter.

“I can’t wait to be a part of it,” said freshman point guard Terion Moss of Portland. “Next year we should be really strong. We’ve got incoming players, and really good ones, so it’s going to be a good rebuilding team.”

Maine will return its top five in terms of minutes per game: Fleming (averaging 13.8 points and 7 rebounds), junior guard Isaiah White (13.3 points), junior guard Sergio El Darwich (10.5), sophomore forward Vilgot Larsson (6.9), and Moss (5.6), who started 14 of 28 games, missing three with a concussion.

Add in three more international recruits who committed during the early signing period and Barron believes the level of competition will go up – during games and practices.

“We’re going to have seven new players next year that aren’t playing this year,” he said. “So for everybody who’s getting minutes this year there’s going to be more competition, more size, more talent on the roster, competing for those minutes.”

Under Walsh, Maine’s roster continuity was disrupted by players transferring out of the program.

Barron said he expects all of his potential returnees to stay in Orono.

“I wouldn’t have recruited them otherwise,” he said. “You can’t turn people over every single year. We’re going to win with a system, and in order for a system to be successful, you’ve got to have guys in the system for years to understand it.”

NOTES: Vermont has won 20-plus games for 11 straight years. Vermont beat Maine 73-49 in Orono and 86-63 in Burlington in the regular season. At Vermont, America East Player of the Year Anthony Lamb and first-team guard Ernie Duncan combined for 50 points as Vermont made 11 first-half 3-pointers. … Prior to Fleming, the last Maine second-team all-conference player was 2012-13 – Justin Edwards and Alasdair Fraser. Edward Little product Troy Barnies was the last Black Bear first-team choice in 2010-11 when Maine went 15-15, its last non-losing season.

While electricity returned to some parts of Caracas nearly 24 hours after lights, phones and the internet stopped working, the blackout was another harsh blow to a country paralyzed by economic and political turmoil.

Many of the few shops that were open were only accepting cash because without electricity and the internet they couldn’t process debit card payments, a common method of doing transactions in Venezuela since hyperinflation transformed the bolivar into one of the world’s most worthless currencies.

“I’m desperate,” said Maria Isabel Garcia, a 39-year-old office worker who hadn’t been able to cook anything for her three young children. She had planned to buy empanadas but had no cash because the bank didn’t have any when she went there Thursday.

Another Caracas resident who is diabetic was searching for ice to preserve his limited supply of insulin medication.

Venezuelans are accustomed to power cuts, but nothing like the one that hit during rush hour Thursday evening, sending thousands of people on long nighttime treks in the dark to their homes. It reached virtually every part of the oil-rich country of 31 million, which was once Latin America’ wealthiest but is now beset by shortages and hyperinflation projected by the International Monetary Fund to reach a staggering 10 million percent this year, compelling about one-tenth of its population to flee in recent years.

The blackout promptly became a point of dispute between President Nicolas Maduro, who blamed sabotage engineered by the “imperialist United States,” and U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who said state corruption and mismanagement that have left the electrical grid in shambles were the cause. Guaido, the leader of Venezuela’s National Assembly, returned from a Latin American tour to Venezuela on Monday in order to escalate his campaign to topple Maduro and hold elections.

Those who have left Venezuela include many with valuable energy expertise, and the government’s allegations of a saboteurs’ plot was met with skepticism by many in Caracas.

“They always say the same thing,” said Carlos Ramos, an economist who was waiting to see a doctor outside the darkened lobby of a Caracas hospital.

Elsewhere in the city, Dr. Luz Ardila Suarez, a gynecologist, said many staffers at the hospital where she works were still on the job Friday morning because they couldn’t get home the previous night. She said the hospital generators had enough fuel for another day or two and that she was especially worried about patients in intensive care.

“There are patients who are connected to machines,” Suarez said. “And of course, there’s no water.”

The director of CODEVIDA, a coalition of Venezuelan health advocacy groups, reported that thousands of dialysis patients were going without treatment as a result of the blackout. While some hospitals were able to rely on backup power sources, others were dark.

By early Friday afternoon, residents and pro-government state broadcaster VTV reported that power was returning to parts of Caracas. Traffic lights in several neighborhoods were back on, while at one office building the electricity flickered to life and then turned off.

Still, Venezuela’s economic woes are likely to increase as U.S. sanctions against its oil industry take their toll, part of an international effort to push Maduro from power. The United States and about 50 other countries back Guaido’s contention that he is the interim president of Venezuela, and that Maduro’s re-election last year was illegitimate because major opposition leaders were barred from running.

Guaido and Maduro, whose chief backers are Russia and Cuba, planned rival demonstrations Saturday as they seek to energize supporters.

“The electricity war declared and directed by the imperialist United States against our people will be overcome!” Maduro wrote on Twitter.

The state-owned electricity operator blamed the outage on an act of “sabotage” at the Guri Dam, one of the world’s largest hydroelectric stations and the cornerstone of Venezuela’s electrical grid. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez described it as a “cyber” attack intended to derail the whole system.

Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez echoed the official line, saying there had been a “new aggression” against the country’s power system that was aimed at destabilizing the country. The leadership of the security forces has remained loyal to Maduro despite appeals from the opposition to turn against him.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro was to blame.

“Maduro’s policies bring nothing but darkness,” Pompeo wrote on social media. “No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro.”

High-ranking officials have been accused in U.S. court proceedings of looting government money earmarked for the electrical system. Venezuelan authorities routinely accuse the opposition of sabotaging infrastructure, though rarely provide evidence.

The government keeps home power bills exceptionally low – just a couple dollars a month – relying heavily on subsidies from the Maduro administration, which is under increasing financial duress.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 counts of filing a false police report following his alleged staged attack on Jan. 29, Chicago’s local CBS affiliate reports. Smollett had previously been charged with a single count of filing a false police report, which alone has the possibility of a three year prison sentence.

Smollett is scheduled to be arraigned in court on March 14. Filing a false report is a class 4 felony. Smollett was indicted on 16 counts because the jury counted each part of the story — that two men hit him, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured chemicals on him — separately.

“[The grand jury] decided he told multiple lies,” legal analyst Irv Miller told CBS. “They were going to charge him for each.” He added, “If you have a crime, and that crime has multiple parts to it, you charge all those separate parts.”

Smollett originally alleged that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in the early hours of Jan. 29 near his Chicago home. He said the attackers yelled that this was “MAGA country.” He also said that the attackers poured bleach on him and put a rope around his neck. Police later claimed that Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to carry out the attack.

Smollett turned himself in and was later released on $100,000 bail. He was also forced to surrender his passport. Empire later announced that they were cutting Smollett from the final two episodes of the show’s fifth season.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a ,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 8

—A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with falsely reporting an offense.

The tale included former Empire extras, a racist and homophobic letter being sent to the Empire set, and Jussie declaring himself the ""gay Tupac.""

On the morning of Jan. 29, 2019, multiple news outlets reported that Smollett had been hospitalized after an attack at 2 a.m. Initial reports said that Smollett had been on his way to a Chicago Subway when he was attacked by two white men outside of the restaurant; the men, who wore ski masks, were said to have shouted ""this is MAGA country"" while beating him, putting a noose around his neck, and ultimately fracturing one of his ribs, although a spokesperson from the Chicago Police Department told Complex that ""there is no report of that being said."" From there, the Chicago Police Department launched an investigation into the reported attack, looking into it as ""a possible hate crime.""

Jan. 30, 2019: The security footage

The Chicago Police Department's chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that ""detectives [had] located a surveillance camera that shows potential persons of interest wanted for questioning."" Images from the footage were distributed in hopes of helping police catch these individuals.

Jan. 31, 2019: The Smollett family responds

Smollett's family released a statement on the attack: ""We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice."" After calling the attack ""domestic terrorism,"" they continued: ""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country.""

Feb. 1, 2019: Jussie speaks

One day after his family spoke out on the incident, and days after everyone from John Legend to the NAACP released statements, Jussie released a statement of his own via Essence, saying, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Feb. 2, 2019: ""I'm the gay Tupac!""

After dropping his first statement, Jussie performed on the Troubadour stage in West Hollywood, where he spoke out about the situation during a live performance. After clarifying that he wasn't hospitalized (he'd just visited a doctor) and that his ribs weren't broken, he made it clear that he fought back against his assailants. Smollett was met with supportive cheers and applause, and went on to call himself ""the gay Tupac.""

Feb. 12, 2019: Smollett's phone records submitted, rejected

Smollett cooperated with the police investigation, including submitting his phone records from the night of the attack. However, according to USA Today, the documents were rejected by police; Sgt. Rocco Alioto stated that the phone records did ""not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.""

Feb. 13, 2019: Arrests made

Eleven days later, Chicago Police arrested two men in connection with the attack, later identified as Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. According to The Wrap, Olabinjo appeared as an extra on Empire in 2015.

Feb. 14, 2019: The Good Morning America interview

ABC scored Smollett's first full-length interview after the attack, where he said he was ""pissed off"" at people questioning his story and the incident.



That evening, more details surfaced about the Osundairo brothers. Chicago police raided their home, seizing five bottles of bleach, electronics, shoes, and other items. Police also stated that the brothers had left for Nigeria on the day of the attack.

As this information was released, some media reports indicated that Chicago PD believed Smollett had staged the attack. Guglielmi tweeted that the media reports alleging that the attack was a hoax were ""unconfirmed by case detectives,"" as there was ""no evidence to support their reporting."" He referred to the supposed CPD sources these outlets had spoken to as ""uninformed and inaccurate.""

Feb. 15, 2019: The brothers are released

While Chicago PD continued to dispute reports that they thought the attack was staged, the two men they arrested were released without being charged. ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations,"" Guglielmi tweeted, ""the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

Feb. 16, 2019: Was it staged?

The next day, more reports suggested that Jussie orchestrated the attack. CNN reported that two police sources had indicated that Chicago PD believed Jussie had paid the two men in question to participate in this staged attack. That same night, Deadline confirmed via a statement from Chicago PD that the department had shifted the trajectory of their investigation ""based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident."" Two days later, Smollett's attorneys said that while they'd keep an ""active dialogue"" with Chicago PD, there were no plans to meet with detectives.

Feb. 19, 2019: The brothers speak

Amid questions of Jussie's role on Empire being diminished, sources told CBS Chicago that the brothers, who were previously arrested as suspects, said that Jussie was the one who sent the letter to the Empire set and that the attack was orchestrated because the letter didn't receive a ""bigger reaction.""

Feb. 20, 2019: Jussie is a suspect

Guglielmi returned to Twitter with an official statement: ""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury."" Attorneys representing Smollett told People that they were mounting an ""aggressive defense,"" noting that, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

Feb. 21, 2019: Jussie is in police custody

Early Thursday morning, Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police. The resulting class 4 felony charges against Smollett could result in up to three years in prison and an estimated $25,000 in additional fines.

Chicago police has released Jussie Smollett's mugshot and a statement regarding his charge of disorderly conduct - false report of offense. pic.twitter.com/bERdd4flCD — Tasneem N (@TasneemN) February 21, 2019

During the subsequent press conference (which you can see in full below), CPD superintendent Eddie Johnson called this incident a ""publicity stunt"" and ""a scar Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve."" They repeated claims that Smollett sent the original letter that started the entire ordeal and confirmed that he'd paid the two brothers $3,500 for their part in the incident. The reasoning? According to Johnson, Smollett was ""dissastified"" with the amount of money he was making on Empire. Chicago PD also called his Good Morning America appearance ""shameful"" and asked that Jussie apologize to the city of Chicago.

Later that day, Smollett was released from police custody after posting $10,000 cash towards the $100,00 bond he was being held on. Multiple outlets reported that he made his way to the Empire set. Fox, who'd stood behind Smollett while this case developed, released a statement saying that they ""are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options."" Meanwhile, Smollett's legal team released their own statement: “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Feb. 22, 2019: Smollet cut from final episodes of Empire

On Friday, Fox announced that Smollett's character Jamal will not appear in the last two episodes of Empire's fifth season, which are currently being filmed in Chicago. A statement from the executives behind Empire, which include Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer, said that the ""disturbing"" nature of the allegations lead to their decision.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" it read. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season."" As of right now, there's no word on if Smollett's character will be removed completely from the series.

The Hollywood Reporter looked into Smollett's contract situation, and while unconfirmed, it's said that Smollett went from reportedly making around $40,000 per episode to $125,000 per episode, although he might have been signed to a 360 deal. Regardless of that, one source is said to have told THR that there was no word of Smollett speaking to Fox regarding being unhappy with his salary, which calls into question the motivation the Chicago Police Department issued during their press conference on February 21.

Feb. 23, 2019: More questions...

Less than 24 hours after the news of his scenes in Empire being cut, a number of questions regarding Jussie’s case came about. Initially, there were reports claiming that Jussie had modeled his alleged hoax after the attack Empire executive producer Lee Daniels’ cousin suffered in January, which Daniels said only occurred because he is gay. Meanwhile, the FBI said that they weren’t certain that Jussie sent the letter that kicked this whole ordeal off in the first place. Finally, there was talk that Jussie’s Empire character might be recast.

Feb. 24, 2019: What was the check for?

Amidst support from Empire co-star Terrence Howard, TMZ reported that the $3,500 check that Chicago PD said Jussie sent to the alleged fake attackers wasn’t for a hoax attack at all, but for fitness training for a video Jussie was planning on shooting. The memo line on the check read ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.”

Mar. 7, 2019: Hospital employees fired, internal investigation begins

CBS2 Chicago reported that dozens of workers and nurses at Northwestern Hospital are said to have been fired for accessing Smollett’s hospital records inappropriately. This was the medical facility that Smollett was treated at after his alleged attack.

That same day, the Chicago PD launched an internal investigation into information leaks that went to the media. In a statement, Chicago PD Sergeant Rocco said he ""would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation. As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

Mar. 8, 2019: Jussie gets indicted

A day later, a Cook County grand jury indicted Jussie on 16 felony counts (he was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report). According to ABC 7, the grand jury hit Jussie with two separate sets of charges, one based on what he originally told police about the attack, and the second based on a second interview later that day.

ABC 7 also reported that each set of charges carries a sentence of probation; the thought is that Jussie would plea out and not have to face jail time.

Mar. 11, 2019: The brothers feel they were ""taken advantage of""

Gloria Schmidt, the lawyer of brothers Abindola and Olabinjo Osundairo, made an appearance on Good Morning America to speak out on their behalf. ""My clients were just taken advantage of by someone they trusted. This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""

Schmidt also reiterated that the $3,500 check was for fitness training, but did indicate that it might have also been used as a part of this alleged attack. ""It's unfortunately,"" Schmidt said, ""a very complicated relationship for them because if you are friends and I'm saying, 'Hey, I am going to pay you for training, I am also asking you to do me a favor'... and the favor was to stage the attack.""

Mar. 14, 2019: Jussie pleads not guilty

Smollett made an appearance in court to enter a plea of not guilty to the 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct he's facing. He's set to appear back in court on April 17.

Mar. 26, 2019: All charges dropped

On Tuesday morning, after word of an emergency hearing in Smollett's case was being held, his attorneys released a statement saying that ""all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him."" State District Attorney Kim Foxx also released a statement, saying that ""After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.""

Feb. 11, 2020: Smollett is indicted by special prosecutor

Almost a year to the day of the initial arrests being made in this case, Jussie Smollett was indicted by special prosecutor Dan Webb on six counts of disorderly conduct in his case. Webb released a statement, saying “further prosecution of Jussie Smollett is in the interest of justice."" Webb was appointed to this case back in August of 2019 to investigate why all of the charges against Jussie were dropped back in March of 2019.

Word is that Smollett would have been facing 50 years in prison if there was a conviction on all 16 counts against him in 2019. Smollett is due back in court on February 24, 2020, and if convicted, could face jail time.

Feb. 24, 2020: Smollett pleads not guilty, wants new charges killed

To the surprise of no one, Jussie Smollett entered a plea of not guilty on the new felony charges brought against him earlier this month. He also filed a motion to have the new charges dismissed, saying that the indictment ""wasn’t proper because the special prosecutor was appointed incorrectly.”

“The circumstances surrounding the initial case in 2019 did not reach the legal level warranting the appointment of a special prosecutor,” their paperwork stated. “Under the terms of the law, in order to appoint a special prosecutor, the office (of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx) had to file a former recusal with the court, and that didn’t occur here.”

Smollett is due back in court on March 18."

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

4:50 p.m.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

The grand jury decided to charge the actor for ""every lie"" that was reported in the alleged staged attack.

Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony charges–one for every lie the actor reportedly told to police related to the Chicago attack.

CBS Chicago reports Smollett's charges stemmed from the grand jury's decision made on Thursday (March 7). The counts represent the statements he made to two Chicago police reports about the January incident. After the actor-singer told police a rope was tied around his neck and the suspect used racial slurs, the case was treated as a hate crime. Things quickly unraveled when it was revealed the ""persons of interest"" were brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who Smollett was familiar with.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment. The allegations–“false report of offense”– are Class 4 felonies and if found guilty, can leave the actor facing three years in prison.

Smollett has denied any involvement in the attack. As Cook County police continue to look into the case, the FBI determined the $3,500 paid to the brothers was for personal training sessions.

Those close to the Empire set have also stood by Smollett, claiming that the narrative that the actor staged the attack over the disagreement of his earnings wasn't true.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" Smollett's attorneys said in February when the allegations came to light.

Smollett was previously charged with one count of disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a racist and homophobic attack.

A grand jury in the US has indicted Empire actor Jussie Smollett on 16 charges related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Chicago grand jury indictment says he made a false report about an offence.

Smollett was charged on February 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him.

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

A lawyer for the actor called the grand jury indictment “vindictive” and “prosecutorial overkill”.

In a statement, Mark Geragos said: “(The indictment) is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

CHICAGO, March 9 — Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public yesterday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of US President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a US$25,000 (RM102,190) fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers US$35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

No further arrest

Smollett has remained free on US$100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on February 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of January 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s Good Morning America days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on February 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of Empire but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

Empire debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season. — Reuters"

Corn tweeted about the graffiti to his over-700,000 followers Tuesday but opted not to share the photo, sparking a flurry of responses from skeptical Twitter users who believed Corn was making up the story entirely or had written the graffiti himself.

I just spotted obscene anti-@AOC graffiti in a bathroom stall in the Phoenix airport. Yes, really. (Not going to post a photo of it.) — David Corn (@DavidCornDC) March 5, 2019

The speculation about the alleged graffiti only intensified after some odd tweets from Phoenix Sky Harbor, the airport where Corn claimed to have found the message.

Corn shared the location of the graffiti with the airport, but the airport maintenance team was unable to find anything in the bathroom stalls. Corn suggested that the graffiti had been removed earlier in the day, noting that it was written in black marker that he was able to partially wipe off with his hand.

Thanks for the follow-up. Our Facilities team checked the restrooms in the area last night, and although they didn’t find anything, those restrooms are checked and cleaned several times a day. — PHX Sky Harbor (@PHXSkyHarbor) March 6, 2019

The airport also refused to confirm if Corn shared a photo of the graffiti with their team, although Corn asked the airport to DM him so he could send it to them.

Hi Amanda, we did have our custodians check the restrooms in Terminal 2 and they let us know that they did not find anything. That doesn’t mean something wasn’t cleaned up earlier in the day. Thanks, — PHX Sky Harbor (@PHXSkyHarbor) March 6, 2019

The exchange caught my attention in light of the recent hoaxed hate crime by “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, so I set out on a mission to see the photo of the Ocasio-Cortez graffiti myself.

I shot a message over to Corn on Wednesday, asking if he could send me the photo if I agreed not to publish it anywhere.

Corn replied that he did not trust me enough to share the photo with me online, an admission I found somewhat ironic considering a whole lot of people didn’t trust Corn enough to think the graffiti was real. Nonetheless, Corn offered to show me the photo in person if I dropped by his office the next day.

We ended up meeting at a coffee shop between our two offices on Thursday morning, and Corn requested I record our conversation, which I was happy to do. As a condition of seeing the photograph of the anti-AOC graffiti, I had to agree not to quote what the graffiti actually said.

Given the relative lengths I had to go to just to catch a glimpse of this photo, I was preparing myself for something pretty wild.

The graffiti consisted of three words and compared Ocasio-Cortez to poop.

Corn was very concerned that I still didn’t believe the graffiti was real, so he pointed emphatically at the location tag on the photo and the time it was taken.

“You can see the time it was taken. Tuesday, 1 o’clock p.m.,” Corn told me. “Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. And if that doesn’t trust you, you can do the information, and it says ‘places: Sky Harbor Blvd., Phoenix, Sky Harbor Airport,’ with a little photo in the middle of the map.”

I asked Corn if he ever sent the photo to the Phoenix Airport, and he said, “I didn’t DM them, because I said follow me and I will DM you the picture, and they never followed me.”

“And they didn’t DM you?” I questioned.

“No, there are no DMs. They said they sent someone to look, and they didn’t find it,” Corn replied. “I think they probably had more important things to worry about at the airport.”

“At least I hope so,” he added. “And I was able to, you know, I was curious how indelible it might be. So I took a piece of toilet paper and rubbed one of the letters, and with a lot of elbow grease it came off, and then I just kind of stopped.”

Corn and I discussed why he thought the graffiti was important enough to warrant a tweet but not important enough to share the photo, and he explained that he thought it was interesting that a freshman congressman was being denigrated so far from the district she represents. However, since posting the tweet, Corn’s interest had clearly shifted from the graffiti itself to the skepticism and personal attacks he received from people who thought he had concocted the story.

“The attacks ranged from questioning my sanity to questioning my masculinity,” he said. “People say I’m only doing this because I want to date her. I mean, why are so many of the criticisms about her sexualized? That’s a pretty interesting question. And then also people saying I should kill myself … I mean that’s a pretty over-the-top question.”

I offered that, while personal attacks are not acceptable, the reaction could be due to general skepticism of the media. I cited recent high-profile stories against conservatives that turned out to be untrue, such as the Covington Catholic kids and the Smollett hoax. (RELATED: Here Are The Most Egregious Fake News Stories Of 2018)

“Well this seems to be ideologically-driven mistrust. I’m betting that if someone at The Daily Caller did this, not all the conservatives would rush out and attack him the way they attacked me,” Corn stated.

“No, but I think liberals probably would,” I replied.

“I don’t think so,” he claimed. “I certainly wouldn’t.”

Later in our conversation, I pointed out that Corn didn’t trust me enough to send me the photo over Twitter.

“Well, yeah, because, you know, I don’t know you,” Corn said. “I know The Daily Caller, and I’ve seen them do things that I don’t agree with, but I did trust you enough to sit down with you and show it to you.”

Corn’s response seemed to debunk his own claim that he wouldn’t automatically distrust reporting from the Caller.

Nonetheless, Corn and I had a longer discussion about the reaction to his tweet, how Twitter has become a platform for reporting in itself and whether or not he should’ve shared the photo with his followers.

Corn said he didn’t want to amplify the troll’s message, whereas I thought he had already done so by posting about the graffiti at all and should’ve shared the photo on request. I argued that conservatives reacted the way they did because they’ve been burned by the media so many times, while Corn thought the response to the tweet was born out of partisan anger.

A few hours after I got back to The Daily Caller office, Corn sent me a few more screenshots of what he called “hateful assaults” from people accusing him of fabricating the anti-AOC graffiti.

Long story short, I can confirm that the anti-AOC graffiti exists. I’m not sure it was worth a 15-minute walk in below-freezing weather, but it is, in fact, real.

Smollett had previously been charged with a single count of filing a false police report, which carries the possibility of up to three years in prison.

A Cook County grand jury returned a more thorough indictment on Saturday. Eight of the charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight pertain to a more detailed account given to Det. Kim Murray.

Smollett told the police that he was assaulted at 2 a.m. by two men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white, according to prosecutors.

""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed,"" the indictment states.

The new counts likely will not have much effect on Smollett's ultimate sentence, should he be convicted, said Andrew Weisberg, a former Cook County prosecutor now in private practice. The charges would run concurrently, so the sentencing range would still be one to three years in prison. However, most defendants in Smollett's situation are sentenced to probation.

""I would still expect a period of probation, a psychological evaluation and restitution to cover costs of the investigation,"" Weisberg told Variety. ""I would still be surprised if he goes to prison.""

Police have alleged that Smollett paid the two men US$3,500 to stage the attack. In a statement last month, officials said they had traced the two attackers using taxi and rideshare records, phone records, and surveillance cameras.

They identified the men as Abel and Ola Osundairo, both of whom had worked on Empire. The two brothers were arrested at Chicago O'Hare Airport and ultimately agreed to cooperate and testify to the grand jury.

Smollett denies the allegations. He has been written off of the last two episodes of this season of Empire."

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.”

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

ABC7 reported on March 8 the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the grand jury’s indictment of Smollett.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment, reported CBS Chicago.

New charges could each carry a possible probation sentence of up to four years.

Smollett has already pleaded not guilty to the first charge. He and his attorneys have denied having anything to do with staging an assault.

Police allege Smollett of paying both Ola and Abel Osundairo, who are originally from Nigeria, $3,500 in the form of a check to carry out the attack. Police have obtained the original check.

CBS Chicago reported Smollett directed the two men to purchase rope, masks, and a hat at a store in Uptown Chicago.

Police allege the brothers wore gloves during the incident and bruises and scratches on his face were self-inflicted.

Attacked for Trying to Eat

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett told police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory, according to The Associated Press.

On January 30, Chicago police confirmed they had reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown but none actually shows the attack happened. Police obtained and released images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

Reports of an assault on Smollett drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

9:30 p.m.

An attorney for Jussie Smollett says a 16-count indictment against the “Empire” actor is “vindictive” and Smollett “maintains his innocence.”

Mark Geragos says in a statement that he did not expect a Cook County grand jury would charge Smollet with 16 separate counts and the indictment is “prosecutorial overkill.”

He says the indictment “is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for making a false report of an attack on him in Chicago. Police say Smollett staged the attack and recruited two brothers to participate. Local media have reported that the Chicago Police Department is investigating leaks to reporters during the investigation of the reported attack.

5:30 p.m.

The16-county grand jury indictment of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett relates to allegations that he lied to police about a reported attack in January — eight counts for what he told a police officer and eight more for what he told a detective.

In the indictment filed Thursday, the Cook County grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective. He gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him. The indictment says that when he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

When Smollett was charged with a single count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, police noted that Smollett had said the attackers were white. Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

Smollett has denied that he staged the attack.

4:50 p.m.

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 per cent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

The Cook County grand jury indictment, dated Thursday and made public on Friday, gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett, according to The Associated Press. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he'd been attacked in late January.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S 'EMPIRE' ROLE CUT FROM SEASON'S FINAL EPISODES, CREATORS SAY

Following the news, attorney Mark Geragos — who is representing Smollett — said in a statement obtained by Fox News on Friday that ""the fact of an indictment was not unexpected.""

""We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination,"" the statement continued. ""What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

A spokesperson for the Cook County State's Attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Also on Friday, Anthony Guglielmi, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department (CPD), tweeted: ""As Supt Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.""

CHICAGO POLICE BLAST JUSSIE SMOLLETT 'PHONY ATTACK': 'BOGUS POLICE REPORTS CAUSE REAL HARM'

Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Chicago Police opened an internal investigation into Smollet's case.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a spokesperson for the force confirmed that ""an internal investigation has been opened.""

""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" the statement continued. ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a sandwich shop in the early morning on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before fleeing.

But that isn't how police say it all went down.

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. After turning himself in, a judge set Smollett's bond for $100,000 and he was released from jail.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S BOND SET AT $100G, JUDGE CALLS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM 'OUTRAGEOUS'

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the ""check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]"" to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 ""for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.""

He said the attack ""was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) 'staged attack' where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence. The actor's legal counsel told Fox News after Smollett was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS BLAST AUTHORITIES, SAY ACTOR WAS 'BETRAYED BY A SYSTEM THAT WANTS TO SKIP DUE PROCESS'

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his team continued.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Illinois attorney Rod Drobinski reviewed the indictment and told Fox News the grand jury hit Smollett with a separate count for every different crime he alleged had been perpetrated against him (eight in all) — to each of the officers he spoke with (two). Thus, the 16 total counts.

The indictment was returned by a Cook County grand jury on Friday. Smollett is set to be arraigned on those charges on March 14. Of the charges, making a false police report, a class 4 felony, is considered the most serious. It carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. The other charges are for disorderly conduct, and for lying to the police in numerous follow-up interviews.

Smollett, who is known for his role on “Empire,” is accused of paying two men to attack him on the streets of Chicago in late January. Smollett, who is black and gay, told police that his alleged assailants, both masked, yelled “MAGA County,” hurled homophobic and racial slurs, beat him up, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck.

Police held a press conference on Feb. 21 to say that Smollett had been taken into custody and was facing charges for allegedly faking his own hate crime, which they said he did because he was upset over a salary dispute.

Lawyers representing Smollett told NBC that they plan to fight the charges.

Empire star Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a Chicago grand jury on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct.

The grand jury returned the indictments Thursday, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office confirmed to Chicago TV station WLS today.

The gay actor had reported that he was the victim of a hate crime January 29 in downtown Chicago. He said two men attacked him, saying “This is MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.” Smollett said they used racist and homophobic slurs, punched him, poured a liquid (possibly bleach) on him, and hung a noose around his neck. The Chicago police investigated, but they eventually declared the attack a hoax staged by Smollett and two associates – something he denies.

He is accused of filing a false police report, for which he was charged February 20 with one felony count of disorderly conduct. He has pleaded not guilty. The additional charges brought by the grand jury also arise from the allegedly false police report. They include one set of charges related to his first report to the police and another to his second interview with them, according to WLS. Each count carries a sentence ranging from probation to four years in prison.

The Chicago police contend Smollett staged the crime because he was dissatisfied with his salary on Empire, a musical drama filmed in Chicago. Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a hip-hop record mogul."

A Chicago grand jury has returned 16 additional felony accounts of disorderly conduct against Empire star Jussie Smollett.

Smollett was originally charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report after claiming he was attacked on January 29 by two men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police accuse Smollett of hiring two brothers and fabricating the attack as a publicity stunt because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Empire. Smollett — who has been an outspoken activist against racism and homophobia — has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal.

“I’m pissed off. It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett told Good Morning America last month. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’”

Thursday’s indictments were split into two categories. ABC Chicago reports: “The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

“The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day,” the report stated.

Last month, Smollett plead not guilty to the initial disorderly conduct charge.

The new indictments carry a possible sentence that ranges from probation to four years in prison. Smollett is expected to return to court later this month."

Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a grand jury in Chicago, according to multiple reports.

The indictment on Friday charges the Empire star with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly making false reports, the Associated Press, CNN and CBS Chicago report.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Smollett, who was charged on Feb. 20 with disorderly conduct, “knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment obtained by CBS Chicago.

A representative for the Cook County State’s Attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Smollett and his legal team previously said they are gearing up to launch an “aggressive defense,” according to his attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement given to PEOPLE on Wednesday. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

Smollett, who claimed he was the subject of a racist and homophobic attack at the hands of two men on Jan. 29 in Chicago, told investigators that he was attacked by two masked men “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs”. He alleged that brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo beat him, placed a noose around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him before fleeing.

Smollett, who was given the presumption of being a victim until the latter stages of the investigation, was the third person arrested in the case.

Brothers Abel and Ola — who were seen on surveillance footage the night of the incident and later questioned by police — were arrested and questioned by police last week but were released after telling police about the alleged hoax.

Authorities allege Smollett of paying the men $3,500 to stage a “bogus” hate crime attack against him to draw attention to himself because the actor was dissatisfied with his salary.

After posting bond and being released from jail last month, Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire, the Fox drama in which he stars as main character Jamal Lyon.

At the February hearing, text messages between Smollett and the Osundairo brothers detailed how the 45-second attack was to be allegedly orchestrated were read in court.

If Smollett is found guilty, falsifying a police report is a Class 4 felony which carries a potential sentence of up to three years in prison.

Headed by Ed Rowe of South Portland and Rich Simon of Newcastle, Windward Development LLC plans to build 38 units of housing on the 6-acre site, including nine single-family homes, 16 townhouse condominiums and 13 townhouse apartments.

Known as Meetinghouse Hill Park, the development will connect O’Neil Street to Pitt Street and include a public park and community garden. The project aims to attract a varied demographic – from young singles and families to empty-nesters and seniors – and be environmentally friendly.

“The proposal aims for redevelopment that is close to net-zero for energy use,” said Joshua Reny, assistant city manager. “All of the buildings are proposed to have solar panels and heat pumps. There will be a significant decrease in impervious surface area and use of best practices in storm-water management.”

The forum will be held from 6:30-8 p.m. in the council chamber at City Hall. For those unable to attend, the meeting will be videotaped and available to view on the city’s website. The developers also will make a presentation before the council at a later date, when public comment will be taken.

The city received three bids for the O’Neil Street site, which is off Cottage Road. Last June, the council accepted Windward’s $400,000 bid based on the recommendation of a nine-member review team that included community members and city officials. Bids were scored based on overall project design, development schedule, plan for public engagement and financial capacity.

The council voted 6-1 on the Windward proposal, despite concerns voiced by residents who said the architect’s modern design didn’t reflect the surrounding Meetinghouse Hill neighborhood. The sought-after area, bounded by Cottage, Sawyer and Walnut streets, is characterized by post-World War II Cape- and colonial-style homes.

Related South Portland picks a buyer to turn former public works site into housing

At the time, Windward estimated a potential property tax benefit to the city of $175,000 annually, based on single-family homes valued at $300,000 each, townhouse condos valued at $250,000 to $350,000 each, and townhouse apartments valued at $200,000 each.

The city’s public works, parks and transportation divisions vacated the O’Neil Street property in late 2017, after the new Municipal Services Facility opened off Highland Avenue.

Throughout 2017, the O’Neil Street Facility Re-use Planning Committee held multiple public forums and site visits before submitting recommendations to the council in January.

The committee found that most residents were open to the site being redeveloped for a mix of single-family homes and apartments, similar to the surrounding neighborhood. They also wanted housing that would be designed for people of all ages and affordable to people earning the city’s median annual household income, which was $59,515 in 2017.

Housing units in Meetinghouse Hill Park will range from 800 to 1,600 square feet and most will be two to three bedrooms, Reny said. The project will be built in phases, with a new road and utilities completed first, along with the single-family homes.

Once the overall design plan is finalized, it will be presented to the council for approval. Then the developers will have to seek a contract zone from the council, complete the purchase of the property and take the project through Planning Board review.

The purchase-and-sale agreement between the city and Windward runs through August 2019, but it could be extended if necessary, Reny said. If all goes well, construction could start as early as next year.

1 Actor indicted: A Cook County grand jury has indicted actor Jussie Smollett on 16 counts that allege he lied to Chicago police about being the victim of an attack. The former “Empire” star had been initially charged last month by prosecutors on one felony count of filing a false report. The incident sparked breathless international media coverage and intense social media speculation, accelerated by the political implications of an openly gay black man’s alleged assault by attackers who put a noose around his neck. Chicago police had worked around the clock on the case for three weeks — first to investigate an alleged hate crime, then to dismantle Smollett’s story, which authorities say he fabricated.

2 Manning jailed: Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been jailed for refusing to testify to a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. In Alexandria, Va., U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered Manning to jail Friday after a brief hearing in which Manning confirmed she has no intention of testifying. She told the judge she “will accept whatever you bring upon me.” Manning has said that she objects to the secrecy of the grand jury process, and that she already revealed everything she knows at her court-martial. The judge said she will remain jailed until she testifies or until the grand jury concludes its work. Manning’s lawyers had asked that she be sent to home confinement instead of the jail, because of medical complications she faces. The judge said U.S. marshals can handle her medical care.

3 Air Force head: Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said Friday she is resigning to become president of the University of Texas at El Paso. A former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico and graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Wilson has headed the Air Force since May 2017, making her President Trump’s first Senate-confirmed service secretary. She had been an early skeptic of Trump’s interest in creating a Space Force as an independent military department, but she publicly embraced the administration’s proposal to Congress last month that would establish a Space Force as a separate service within the Department of the Air Force.

4 Jackson episode removed: In Los Angeles, the producers of “The Simpsons” said they are removing a classic episode that featured the voice of Michael Jackson. Executive producer James L. Brooks told the Wall Street Journal this week, “It feels clearly the only choice to make.” He says fellow executive producers Matt Groening and Al Jean are “of one mind on this.” The action follows HBO’s broadcast of the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” in which two men allege Jackson sexually abused them as children. Jackson’s family has criticized the program, and his estate is suing HBO. In the 1991 “Stark Raving Dad” episode, Jackson voiced a character who claims to be Jackson and who meets Homer Simpson in a mental institution.

In recent weeks, the case was unsealed to the public, and the Chicago police department issued a new statement on details from their investigation. There were also rumors that Smollett would be returning to Empire for its final season, but those rumors were later squashed. Scroll down for a time line of the case from day one all they way through to the most recent news.

Slide 1 of 14 Alleged Victim (Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Images for The Trevor Project) Jussie Smollet is a 36-year-old actor, who is currently most well-known for his role as Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire. He has earned three award nominations from his time on the series. Prior to Empire, Smollett was a child actor who appeared in a number of films and TV series such as The Mighty Ducks, North and On Our Own. He is the older brother to actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell, who was on Full House as a child and will be appearing as Black Canary in the upcoming Birds of Prey movie.

Slide 2 of 14 The Attack (Photo: Instagram / Lee Daniels) On Jan. 29, Smollett alleged that he was attacked outside of an apartment building by two white men who beat him because he is gay and black. He stated to police that they yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" while assaulting him, pouring a liquid believed to be bleach on him, and putting a noose around his neck. Smollett claimed to have fought the men off and called for help, who arrived to find him still with the rope around his neck. He was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to have his injuries treated but was released after it was determined that he had not suffered any serious wounds.

Slide 3 of 14 Smollett's Statement (Photo: Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images) Following the attack, Smollett broke his silence by providing a statement to Essence magazine. ""Let me start by saying that I’m O.K. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,"" the statement began. “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" Smollett continued. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me,"" he added. ""With Love, respect & honor... Jussie,"" the statement concluded.

Slide 4 of 14 Persons of Interest (Photo: @monster_in_the_flesh / Instagram) Police reviewed surveillance footage from the area where the alleged attack took place and discovered individuals they believed to be persons of interest. Eventually, authorities were able to identify the men and brought them in for questioning. They were released without charges. The two men are brothers named Abel and Ola Osundairo, and they are of Nigerian descent. It was later alleged that Smollett and the brothers were seen in his apartment building elevator together on the night of the alleged attack.

Slide 5 of 14 Hoax Allegations (Photo: Theo Wargo/Getty Images) During their interview with police, the Osundairo brothers claimed that they had not assaulted Smollett but rather he paid them to be involved. Police later confirmed that they had evidence to suggest he paid the men $3,500 to help him carry out the hoax, in the form of the actual check he wrote to them. In a statement, the Osundairo brothers said, ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Slide 6 of 14 Smollett's Response (Photo: Getty Images) The actor's attorneys released a statement in regard to the hoax allegations, saying on hs behalf, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" Following the new developments, it was reported that police wanted to speak with Smollett again. He reportedly refused, issuing a statement though his PR rep, Anne Kavanagh. “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today,” Kavanagh's statement read.

Slide 7 of 14 Charged with Felony Disorderly Conduct and Arrested (Photo: Chicago Police Department) On Feb. 20 Smollett was officially charged with felony disorderly conduct after police determined that he filed a false police report regarding the assault. The following day, the Empire actor turned himself in to police. During a press conference, Chicago P.D. officials advised that Smollett would have a bond hearing later in the day. At the hearing, Smollet was given a $100,000 bond and ordered to surrender his passport.

Slide 8 of 14 Motive (Photo: Chuck Hodes/FOX) During their press conference, Chicago police also offered a motive for Smollett's faked assault. They claimed that he did it because he was not satisfied with his Empire salary. While they did not offer much more info than that at the time, the implication seems to be that he intended to gain more public notoriety and use it to leverage for a bigger payday.

Slide 9 of 14 Dropped from 'Empire' (Photo: Fox) After bonding out of jail, Smollett returned to the set of Empire where sources told TMZ that he apologized to the cast and crew for what has happened. ""I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this,” he said. Producers eventually revealed that Smollett had been dropped from the remainder of the most recent season. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" a joint statement from the producers read. ""Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out."" ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement added. More recently, it was reported that Smollett had been fully let go from Empire, with creator Lee Daniels stating the actor will not be appearing in the upcoming final season.

Slide 10 of 14 Indicted on 16 Felony Counts (Photo: Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images) On March 8 it was announced that Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts of lying to the police about the assault. According to CBS News in Chicago, the allegations are specifically referred to as “false report of offense"" and are Class 4 felonies. “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment read in part.

Slide 11 of 14 ""Not Guilty"" Plea (Photo: Getty) On March 14, Smollett appeared in court again to be arraigned on the charges he faces. The actor pleaded ""not guilty."" While he awaited his next court date, he was expected to stay in Chicago, but was allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York to meet with his lawyers as long as he gave sufficient notice to authorities ahead of time.

Slide 12 of 14 Charges Dropped, Case Dismissed (Photo: Patrick Hoelck/FOX) On March 26, the prosecution in Smollett's case announced that they had reached a plea deal with the actor, where in he would surrender his $10,000 bond and agree to do community service. In exchange, all charges were dropped and the case against him was dismissed. ""Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him. Jussie was attacked by 2 people he was unable to identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgment,"" Smollett's attorneys said in a statement. ""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that a victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result,"" the statement added.

Slide 13 of 14 911 Call Released (Photo: Shareif Ziyadat/Getty Images) After about five months after the alleged assault, the call that Smollett's friend placed to 911 was finally released. In audio shared by TMZ, the unidentified caller of could be heard telling the 911 operator that the ""attackers"" wrapped ""a noose around"" Smollett's neck. The caller is also heard saying that the Empire actor did not want to file a police report, but the friend was going to make him because the incident was ""really f—ed up."""

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

CHICAGO - A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment - eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective - comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck - a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Smollett was born in Santa Rosa in 1982."

The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct -- the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police -- are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren't uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett's comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective.

The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. ""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date -- Jan. 29.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed -- a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos, his attorney, said."

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions levelled on social media that he had been less than co-operative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 per cent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 8

—A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with falsely reporting an offence.

A 20-year-old college student at the University of Southern California at the time, he’d recently converted to Christianity and was eager to plunge into the Scripture that he’d heard so much about.

There was just one problem, Chung recalls: “I didn’t want to read it.”

The text was small and serious-looking, each line corralled inside densely packed, numbered columns devoid of imagery – like citations at the end of a biology textbook. Inside, the pages were toilet paper thin. Outside, the cover was solid black and intimidating.

For an artistic college student studying communications, design and advertising, the “good book” looked surprisingly bad.

“There were 20 pages before you actually got to Genesis,” Chung said, remembering how impatient he felt. “As an artist and designer and a reader, I was thinking, ‘This is not good design.’ “

Over the past 2,000 years, scholars say, no other book has been reimagined and reinterpreted as many times in history as the Bible. Each iteration – from early translations in Greek to the King James edition – was created to reach a new audience.

Five hundred years after the modern printing press spread biblical text worldwide, the book is struggling to reach one of its toughest audiences yet: Millennials, a generation of expressive, digital natives who are increasingly likely to read on a tablet than open a book. They are also far less likely to read or trust the Bible than older generations, surveys show, and their skepticism is at the forefront of Americans’ deteriorating relationship with the ancient text.

Now Christian publishers are scrambling to repair that relationship by making the Bible more accessible and attractive to a generation of young people for whom the written word no longer resonates as strongly. Their efforts are a way of embracing the present, but also a nod to the Church’s medieval past, when an illiterate populace relied on beautiful frescoes, sculptures and majestic cathedrals to understand the Christian message.

A decade after his failed attempt at reading, Chung has turned his early aversion to the Bible into a growing business. He’s half of a duo trying to make the Bible “millennial-friendly,” sharing their ancient faith with a new generation shaped by an unending stream of visual content and social media stimulation.

To do that, his Los Angeles-based start-up, called Alabaster, places the full text of each biblical book inside publications that resemble chic, indie lifestyle and design magazines – like those you might find on your most fashionable friend’s coffee table. Alabaster uses the New Living Translation of the Bible.

Negative space is plentiful, and the text is a stylish Sans Serif font, dwarfed by the kind of moody, still-life images that proliferate on Instagram.

For inspiration, the partners didn’t look to contemporary Christian artists or the Catholic Church, but urbane magazines like Cereal, Kinfolk and Drift. They also studied hip, era-defining brands like Warby Parker, Harry’s, Shinola and Swedish watchmaker Daniel Wellington. Those companies, they say, understand something that the discerning millennial mind treats as, well, Gospel: the quality of a product’s visual packaging is just as important as the quality of the product itself.

The Bible may be a holy book, Chung realized, but it’s also a “content-rich lifestyle brand” – one in desperate need of a modern upgrade.

“Visual culture is everything for millennials,” Alabaster co-founder Bryan Ye-Chung said. “That’s what is important to us, too, so we wondered why can’t a faith-based product take advantage of that space as well?”

The start-up is not without competition. Absorbing Christian teachings without opening a Bible or stepping inside a church has never been easier. Instagram has helped turn megachurch pastors like Carl Lentz and Steven Furtick into fashion-forward “influencers” with millions of followers. The number of people who have downloaded mobile apps offering thousands of biblical translations, texts and access to podcasts is now in the hundreds of millions. Ancient manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls have been digitized for online consumption, and now anyone with Internet access can listen to Bible readings in the book’s original languages – Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.

Why read about the Holy Land when you can strap on a virtual reality headset that offers 3-D tours of sacred Christian sites? If VR isn’t your thing, you can download apps that pair smartphone photos with Bible verses, creating shareable content for social media. If you don’t want to read the Bible, then Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant, can do it for you. As faith-based organizations seek to share their message in new ways, even their job postings have begun to resemble those from Silicon Valley tech firms, with organizations recruiting product designers and software engineers.

“We’ll do anything short of sin to reach people who don’t know Christ,” according to the Life.Church website. “For us, that means leveraging the latest technology, pursuing new ideas, and staying close to God’s Word.”

The digital products may be new, but the sensibility is not, according to Matthew Engelke, a professor of religion at Columbia University. The Protestant impulse has always been to expand outward, Engelke said, finding new ways to engage new groups of people. The rise of digital culture over the past 20 years has heightened that impulse, he said.

For today’s evangelicals, Engelke said, a rising tide of secular atheism is no longer considered the greatest threat to the church.

“It’s the stuck in the mud old Christian who doesn’t move with the times and refuses to recognize that you can’t get people into church reading the King James version in the evenings on the radio anymore,” Engelke said. “Times have changed and many Christians recognize they need to change with the times.”

As millions of Christians find new avenues to explore their faith online, companies like Thomas Nelson, the largest Christian publishing house in the world, say the appetite for physical copies of the Bible remains strong, but customer expectations are rapidly changing because of digital culture. No longer interested in their grandparents’ plain black Bibles, younger customers have begun requesting books with sewn binding, environmentally friendly paper, gold gilding and pricey goatskin covers. The Bible publisher Zondervan has introduced hand-painted covers inspired by Etsy artists, as well as shimmering images that change when the page is turned.

The school board voted 14-9 Thursday night to “respectfully retire” the nickname and sports mascot, making SAD 54 the final public school district in Maine to let go of what critics have called racist imagery that insults Native Americans. With weighted votes from each of the six SAD 54 towns, the vote was 558 in support of retiring the nickname and 441 against the change.

Supporters, opponents set to renew debate over Indians nickname in Skowhegan

“The vote went as it should,” director Derek Ellis of Skowhegan said. “We can’t rewrite history, but we can make it.”

Brent Colbry, superintendent of SAD 54, said after the vote that the board and the community will decide on what next to do about changing the name.

“What we’re going to do next is we’re obviously going to sit back and put together a strategy or plan on how do we make the transition,” Colbry said. “It has to involve community, kids, staff and a lot of stakeholders to try to come up with a direction.”

Debate over the “Indians” name has raged loudly in and out of school board meetings since 2015, when the board voted 11-9 to keep the name. Some board members at the time said that the word “mascot” was a misnomer, as the district had dropped all the feathers, warpaint and characters years before. But critics, including members of Maine’s tribes, persisted that the schools’ use of the “Indians” name amounted to a racist and demeaning mascot to real Native Americans.

“It is a vote,” board Chairwoman Dixie Ring of Canaan announced Thursday, prompting both cheering and anger from the audience. Five police officers, including the police chief, attended the meeting.

There were vows that the fight was not over and charges that the board vote to keep the mascot in 2015 was not honored. There were complaints that “outsiders” had the final word Thursday night in the high school cafeteria jammed with people on both sides of the issue.

Board member Jennifer Poirier, who was the driving force behind the Skowhegan Indian Pride Facebook group to keep the “Indians” nickname, said she knew the board was split on the issue and indicated that supporters of the name would challenge the board vote.

“I don’t think it’s over,” she said. “I think the community’s going to be coming back because it’s not the will of the majority of the community. There’s been talk if the budget’s going to pass. We’ll see.”

Lynda Quinn, an SAD 54 board member who voted against retiring the nickname, said Friday that she respects the process and outcome. She called the 14-9 vote “resounding” and an indication that “things have changed and majority rules.” Now, Quinn said, officials should turn their attention to being “slow, methodical, thoughtful and careful” as the name change is carried out.

“I hope that cool heads prevail. I hope there is a committee, a great cross-section of people from all aspects of Skowhegan, and that we do what we need to,” Quinn said. “We will move forward. Some people are concerned that there’s a lot of hurt feelings, but I’m not so sure. I’m going to carry on and move forward.”

Poirier, though, said the school board appeared to have been representing people from “outside of the community.” She was seemingly referring to those such as Maulian Dana, the ambassador of the Penobscot Nation, and her father, Barry Dana, of Solon, the one-time chief of the Penobscot Tribe. They and the leaders of the Maine Indian tribes and others have called for the removal of the mascot for years.

Barry Dana, who was present Thursday night for the vote, said the past four years have been difficult.

“It was a real tough thing to sit through, yet a real interesting thing,” he said after the vote. “My gut, balling up inside me, but I also had my spirit soaring with some of the testimony that some of the people on the board gave. I don’t begrudge anyone else for maintaining their position. But I think they made the right move.”

The board first met to consult with its attorney in a special executive session. Attorney Micheal Boucher from Drummond Woodsum law firm had attended a previous meeting. Then each person on the 23-member school board was given an opportunity to speak.

Some people dressed in the Skowhegan Indians black and orange at Thursday night’s meeting said that they were disappointed with the vote.

“It’s very disturbing that people from outside can come in and override the people who are from the community,” said Bobbi Savage of Norridgewock. “It’s’s not over.”

Kathy LeBrun, a resident who said her mother is a full-blooded Passamaquoddy, said at a recent meeting that she thought the issue already had been settled to keep the nickname. She said she and her family are not offended by use of the word “Indians.”

“The Penobscot ambassador does not speak for us,” she said, referring to Maulian Dana, who also was allowed to speak. “Remember my ancestors. Don’t wipe them out again.”

Since SAD 54 officials began debating the nickname’s use again over the last year, many people and groups have weighed in. Soon after taking office, Gov. Janet Mills encouraged the SAD 54 board to discontinue the nickname, and Maine’s Department of Education on March 1 urged schools “to refrain from using mascots and logos that depict Native American tribes, individuals, customs, or traditions.”

The staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine sent a letter in December to the school board chairwoman and the superintendent urging them to “do the right thing” and drop the “Indians” nickname. On Friday, the Maine ACLU released a statement in which staff attorney Emma Bond called the decision to retire the nickname a “historic moment for Skowhegan and our state,” adding that Maine is now “poised to become the first state in the nation to successfully end the harmful use of indigenous mascots in schools.”

“By retiring the harmful mascot, the town of Skowhegan is forging a bold new legacy of leadership,” Bond said in the statement.

But Quinn, the school board member, cautioned that people who were against retiring the nickname may yet have more to say – and they should be heard, she said.

“This cannot be done too quickly,” Quinn said. “To me – and I understand why the school board voted the way they did – the community at large had a lot to say and I don’t think they thought their wants and desires were taken into account. The process now needs to be slow and a lot of people need to weigh in.”

Colbry, the superintendent, said Friday that he expects a strategy will be worked out by the school board in the coming weeks, likely taking months or “whatever time it takes to do it right. I might bring a tentative proposal for them (the school board) to react to.

“I don’t know what that would look like,” Colbry said, “but I think it’s a big tent approach with voices from all constituencies.”

Pictures, posters and maybe even T-shirts marking the Bruins improbable 4-3 comeback win over the Panthers would have popped up for sale all over Boston.

But even though it only happened in March, it seemed to raise the temperature of this current Bruins hot streak to a new threshold. It feels like the kind of run and kind of wins, teams have in the midst of special seasons.

To recap, with two of their best scorers – David Pastranak and Jake DeBrusk – sidelined with injuries, the Bruins fell behind 2-0. If that wasn’t enough to deflate most teams, erasing that deficit only to fall behind again might have. But the Bruins trailed 3-2 with a minute left and scored twice to win in regulation.

“We know we have a special group, we know we have a good team and a really good atmosphere in the room. Guys get along really well,” Brad Marchand said. “But, we’re not going to win all those games, we can’t continue to get down two-nothing and expect to win each game, but you do have to be able to come back in games like that.”

Charlie McAvoy still seemed to be convincing himself it actually happened.

“Man, what an exciting game. Kind of felt like it had everything. What an effort by us,” he said. “It’s just this team, you know. No one ever says die. … What a great effort by our team. Everybody played their part tonight. No one quit, all the way down to the last buzzer. What an exciting game.”

Given the way Boston has played since mid-January (14-0-4), the final sequence while logically shocking wasn’t entirely unexpected. It’s the same team that erased a two-goal deficit to beat Carolina and thoroughly dominated first-place Tampa Bay a week ago.

“The way that we’ve been playing is always finding ways and it’s not always going to be perfect, it’s not always going to be your best game, but you’re one shot away from being back in the game,” said Patrice Bergeron, who had a short-handed goal to tie the game at 2-2 and the decisive goal with 6.7 seconds left. “That’s what we talked about in the third. I thought we were better but then giving up that third goal, we could have crumbled but we stuck with it and we found a way.”

Bergeron had skated long shifts directly before each of the Panthers’ successful second-period power plays, so he was on the bench for both goals.

Even down a man, Bergeron’s presence can often set a tone and settle things down. His short-handed goal tied the game at 2-2 in the third period and his leadership, even on the bench, helped spur the comeback, according to Coach Bruce Cassidy.

Bruins forward David Backes, who spent most of his career in St. Louis, marveled at seeing him up close.

“Being in the West when he was in the East, there was a little bit of appreciation but you didn’t get to see him as frequently,” he said. “Being on the same team with him every day to see what he does behind the scenes, the way he works on the ice and the way he produces and he’s been clutch. He’s certainly up there. He’s a guy if you had to start a team, if he’s not the first on your list, I’d be pretty impressed with who else you’re putting in front of him.”

Backes could have been describing his team. On any list of who is playing the best in the NHL right now, if the Bruins aren’t first on the list, it would take somebody pretty impressive to be in front of them.

CHICAGO — A grand jury in Chicago indicted Empire actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday says he made a false report about an offense.

The Cook County State's Attorney charged Smollett on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him. Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack."

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

Advertisement

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

The Empire star, 36, had initially been charged last month with one count of disorderly conduct after he allegedly staged being assaulted by racist homophobic Trump supporters.

But a Chicago grand jury - which decides charges in major cases - has applied that charge a further 15 times over in an 86-page indictment filed on Thursday.

Smollett, 36, claimed that two white men set upon him in the city - yelling racist and homophobic abuse and placing a noose around his neck.

While not carrying additional prison time should he be convicted, each fresh charge brings a maximum probation sentence of four years.

Neither Smollett's legal team or prosecutors in Cook County, the Chicago district which brought the charges, have commented.



'RACE HATE HOAX'

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama is accused of lying to cops about the supposed race-hate attack in Chicago.

He claimed he was set-upon by two Trump supporters in the early hours of January 29.

Smollett reported to police that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

'TRUMP SUPPORTERS'

They then struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled, he alleged.

The supposed attackers had shouted ""This is MAGA country"" - referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But the two men were found to be associates of Smollett and cops said the actor had staged the beating to improve his £77,000-an-episode TV contract.

All of the charges are related to statements that Smollett gave to police officers that his hate crime happened, according to CNN’s reports. For instance, Smollett had said that he was attacked by a white man, and it came to light, instead, that he’d allegedly paid two African-American men (American men of Nigerian descent) to attack him.

Smollett had told Chicago police officers that two attackers who shouted “MAGA country” at him (in reference to the Make America Great Again hats that have been associated with racism), poured a substance on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Tests reportedly showed that the substance was bleach.

“I smelled bleach,” Smollett said. “I know the smell of bleach and I saw on my sweatshirt it had marks on it – like spots on it when you have a bad bleach job. So, then I was like, ‘There’s bleach on me too!’”

Smollett’s quotes, if false, only served to increase the hype of his story.

“When the police came, I kept the clothes on me…I kept the rope,” Smollett said of the alleged noose around his neck. “It wasn’t wrapped around [my neck], but it was around because I wanted them to see. I wanted them to see what this was.”

Police investigated Smollett’s case as a hate crime, but then found that he had paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack on him.

Police investigators, specifically Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson, said that Smollett had staged his attack “because he was dissatisfied with his salary.” Johnson was referencing this information, based on reports that his police department had gotten from the two who’d been allegedly paid to attack Smollett.

Smollett has denied police reports.

Still, once the Chicago PD finished their investigation, they charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct.

Smollett was granted a $100,000 bail, and he paid a $10,000 bond. He had to give up his passport as well.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” his attorneys said in a statement last month. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

The show, Empire, on which Smollett stars, decided to remove his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season after his arrest.

The producers cut his character to “avoid further disruption on set,” reportedly.

Smollett, is black and openly gay; he additionally plays a gay character on Empire.

Initially, the 36-year-old actor had been charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct at the end of February.

Now, a grand jury has tacked on an additional 15-count felony indictment against him, due to the magnanimous nature of him claiming falsely–according to police–to be the victim of racist and homophobic attacks.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago’s police chief said that Smollett had paid two brothers to stage an assault on him.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” the producers of the show said in a statement. “Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, and showrunner Brett Mahoney were among the lead producers who signed the statement.

Their show is in its fifth season and was said to have been filming in Chicago when the Smollett incident happened.

In an interview with Robin Roberts after his alleged hoax incident occurred, Smollett had said on national television, “I just want young people, young members of the LGBTQ community, young black children to know how strong that they are, to know the power that they hold in their little pinky.”

Smollett’s attorneys report that they have no statement to give about his 16 felony counts at this time."

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago police said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

A lawyer for the actor called the grand jury indictment “vindictive” and “prosecutorial overkill”.

In a statement, Mark Geragos said: “(The indictment) is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy.”"

The Empire actor was previously charged in a criminal complaint with felony disorderly conduct, involving lying to police in relation to a supposed racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago on 29 January.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment, CBS Chicago said in a report on Friday afternoon.

The actor, who is openly gay and best known for his role as the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox TV show, prompted widespread shock and concern when it emerged he had reported being attacked while walking home in the early hours. He told police two masked men – one of them wearing a red Make America Great Again hat – shouted racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him, put a noose around his neck, and doused him with a chemical.

Police said Smollett had paid those two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, criticised the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Geragos also said that levelling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago police officer Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Questions about Smollett’s potential role in the alleged attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police, and word that detectives in a city full of surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of any attack.

The actor told Good Morning America he had been unable to give detectives a good description of his assailants as their faces were obscured. “You have to understand it’s Chicago in winter – people can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that,” he said.

Police said after Smollett was arrested last month that they believed he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on Empire and was trying to draw attention to his plight."

The multiple counts highlight different aspects of Smollett’s allegedly phony story, including claims that his attackers beat him, poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck.

The indictment comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors charged Smollett with a single felony count and he was released from Cook County Jail after a friend posted his $100,000 bond.

Smollett is scheduled to appear in the Leighton Criminal Court Building on Thursday so a judge can be assigned to preside over his case and he can plead not guilty to the 16 counts.

The actor, 36, is accused of staging a phony attack on himself, then telling police he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, has said he was walking from a Subway sandwich shop to his apartment in downtown Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him and wrapped a noose around his neck.

Smollett said they also yelled “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Trump’s campaign slogan of “Make America Great Again.”

Police initially treated the incident as a hate crime, but their focus turned to Smollett after two brothers who were alleged to have been his attackers told police that Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack – with a promise of another $500 later.

Police pieced together much of their evidence by reviewing footage from about 55 police and private surveillance cameras showing the brothers’ movements before and after the attack.

The shift in the investigation came amid often bitter public debate and stinging skepticism on social media – doubts that Smollett addressed in a national TV interview and in a strongly worded statement after the brothers were released from custody after questioning by police.

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett told police he received a threatening letter at work. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in Bedford Park, a southwest Chicago suburb, on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters “MAGA” were handwritten in the upper left corner of the envelope.

Prosecutors said Smollett staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio’s response to the threatening letter. Chicago police took it a step further, accusing Smollett of faking the letter as well.

The letter is the subject of a separate federal investigation.

On Feb. 21, the day Smollett was initially charged, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted the actor, saying the hoax dragged “Chicago’s reputation through the mud.”

Smollett gave an impassioned interview defending his story on ABC News as skepticism grew around his claims.

Smollett turned himself in to police last month and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters the actor made up the assault. Johnson claimed Smollett was upset with his salary, prompting the actor to send a fake, threatening letter to himself with ""MAGA"" written on it.

""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" Johnson said. ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?

CHICAGO - A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

The 36-year-old “Empire” star faces four years' probation for each charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Smollett, who was initially charged with one felony count, has pleaded not guilty to that first charge and was released on $100,000 bond.

Smollett claimed on Jan. 29 that he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked men who shouted racist and homophobic remarks at him. He alleged that they secured a noose around his neck and threw what he believed was bleach on him.

But the Chicago Police Department said during a press conference in February that there was significant evidence that Smollett fabricated the attack, after they originally investigated the incident as a hate crime. The police also claimed Smollett paid two brothers $3,600 to conduct the attack.

Chicago police revealed Friday that there is an investigation examining how details of the probe looking at the alleged attack were disclosed to the media.

According to CBS News, on Friday, March 8, a Chicago grand jury granted the indictment, further increasing the Empire star’s legal woes.

It has been reported that the vast majority of the counts are considered felonious and “the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of two-to-five years,” according to the network. The indictment charges that Jussie Smollett was well aware that there were no justifiable grounds for the offenses that he alleged. As previously reported, Jussie claimed to have been confronted by two unidentified assailants, one of which wore a red “Make America Great Hat.” The actor/singer also claimed the two men spewed homophobic and racist slurs as they attacked and beat him.

However, the allegations don’t stop there. The grand jury has reportedly expanded the case highlighting a number of other offenses as a result of Jussie Smollett’s actions. The number of felony counts stem from the false claims Jussie provided to the Chicago Police Department. The indictment reportedly notes that “each count covers various alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers – including that he was hit by two men, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured a chemical on him,” reports the publication.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment.

The latest news follows a string of reports about Jussie Smollett’s attack. Initially, fans rallied behind Smollett as reports surfaced about the disheartening attack he’d suffered. After being released from a Chicago-area hospital, Jussie appeared on Good Morning America to share his story.

During an interview with Robin Roberts, Jussie shared his reaction to the attack and all of the speculation surrounding the attack.

“I’m pissed off. It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett told Good Morning America, according to Essence magazine. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'”

However, things changed drastically as details about the attack surfaced. Several days after a number of reports had been released, the Chicago Police Department accused Jussie Smollett of orchestrating his own attack.

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 7

—A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with falsely reporting an offense.

In the indictment, the grand jury makes it clear that Smollett added details to his account of what happened Jan. 29 when he talked to the detective.

The actor, who is black and gay, gave a basic version to the police officer that included allegations that he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett said he could see from the skin around one of the attacker’s eyes through the mask that he was white, according to the indictment. He also said that the attackers looped a rope around his neck.

Police say that in fact, the two men who have admitted taking part in the staged attack are both black.

As the disgraced Empire actor approached the building, he was greeted by the sounds of several protesters shouting, “We are here to support black people. We are here today today to support LGBTQ people.”

Shortly after proceedings began, Smollett and his legal team entered a plea of not guilty on all 16 felony counts. According to TMZ, he’ll be required at every upcoming court date and allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York for appointments with his attorneys.

However, he’ll have to give the courts 48-hour notice and check back in within 24 hours when he returns to Chicago.

In January, Smollett told police he was brutally attacked by two men hurling racial and homophobic slurs at him. As the details surrounding the alleged assault started to take shape, investigators came to the conclusion the attack was staged.

As a result, Smollett was charged with a disorderly conduct felony. But earlier this month, a grand jury handed down the 16-count indictment, which Smollett’s attorney referred to as “overkill.”

Smollett is expected back in court next month.

[This article has been updated. The original version of the article was published on March 8, 2019 and can be found below.]

A grand jury has indicted Jussie Smollett on 16 felony accounts for filing false police reports about an alleged hate crime. According to CBS Chicago, a Cook County grand jury returned the 16-count felony indictment against him on Thursday (March 7).

Smollett was originally charged by the State Attorney’s Office with a disorderly conduct felony, but the new indictments compound Smollett’s situation even further.

The grand jury handed over two sets of charges: one for Smollett’s initial report to the Chicago Police Department and the other for Smollett’s second interview with investigators. Both are Class 4 felonies.

The indictment partially reads, “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.”

Smollett allegedly staged the racist and homophobic attack outside of his Chicago apartment building in January. He told police he was attacked as he was walking home around 2 a.m. local time on January 29.

He said two masked men screamed “racist and homophobic slurs,” put a noose around his neck and poured a chemical (believed to be bleach) on them. One reportedly said, “This is MAGA country” while wearing a red hat associated with the Trump’s “Make America Great Again” initiative.

As police dove further into Smollett’s account, they determined the Empire actor had paid Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage the attack. CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett also ordered the Osundairo brothers to buy the noose, hat and masks at an Uptown hardware store.

The police also believe the scratches and bruises on Smollett’s face were likely self-inflicted, although the brothers did punch him.

Smollett allegedly staged the attack because he was upset about the salary Empire was paying him.

The disgraced actor is scheduled for arraignment on March 14."

Smollet claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him and shouted “This is MAGA Country” after assaulting him.

Smollett, 36, and his attorneys have previously denied the allegations against him, and the actor still insists that the attack was real. Smollett claimed his alleged attackers poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News at the time of his arrest that the investigation into the alleged attack demanded “considerable” police resources. He said that at one point the department had 12 detectives scouring surveillance videos of the area.

Police also have said Smollett, who had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, refused to turn over his phone records to the investigators. Smollett has been accused by Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson of fabricating the attack as a way of negotiating for a better salary on Empire.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him.

Police said Smollett told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country” – an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show.

Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

A spokeswoman for Smollett, who was arrested and later released on $100,000 (£76,823) bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him, did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.

An attorney for the actor could not immediately be reached for comment."

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

Not clear why jury indicted on 16 counts

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

""The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what's called a probable cause proceeding. I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,"" Geragos told NBC's Access after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 US to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 counts, accused of falsely claiming to police that he had been the victim of a hate crime.

Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report.

The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Police say he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career.

Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in.

Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence.

What is Jussie Smollett accused of?

Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.

He was charged with making a false statement to police and, on Thursday, a grand jury returned 16 counts of disorderly conduct against him.

At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000 (£76,000).

Mr Smollett denies all the charges against him and will appear in court on 16 March.

His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"".

What did he say had happened?

Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago.

He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans.

He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"".

How has the case unfolded?

Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene.

The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours.

Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"".

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire.

Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500.

Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role.

In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?""

He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".

Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards."

CHICAGO -- A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment - eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective - comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.



Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck - a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

The jury returned the indictment on Thursday, CBS Chicago reported, and Smollett is set to be arraigned on March 14.

Smollett has been charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct in connection with falsely filing a police report. He has not yet entered a plea but has maintained his innocence.

“I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this,” Smollett told the cast and crew of ""Empire,"" according to TMZ.

Fox, which produces ""Empire,"" later announced that Smollett would be suspended in order to ""avoid further disruption on set.""

Smollett’s attorneys had previously said that the “presumption of innocence” was disregarded for Smollett.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” Smollett’s legal team said in a statement. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

They did not immediately respond to Thursday's indictment.

But a Chicago grand jury - which decides charges in major cases - has applied that charge a further 15 times over in an 86-page indictment filed on Thursday.

Smollett, 36, claimed that two white men set upon him in the city - yelling racist and homophobic abuse and placing a noose around his neck.

While not carrying additional prison time should he be convicted, each fresh charge brings a maximum probation sentence of four years.

Neither Smollett's legal team or prosecutors in Cook County, the Chicago district which brought the charges, have commented.



'RACE HATE HOAX'

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama is accused of lying to cops about the supposed race-hate attack in Chicago.

He claimed he was set-upon by two Trump supporters in the early hours of January 29.

Smollett reported to police that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

'TRUMP SUPPORTERS'

They then struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled, he alleged.

The supposed attackers had shouted ""This is MAGA country"" - referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But the two men were found to be associates of Smollett and cops said the actor had staged the beating to improve his £77,000-an-episode TV contract.

A Chicago grand jury has returned a 16-count indictment against Empire actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime, according to multiple Chicago media reports.

Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month. But a true bill handed down on Thursday—and first reported by Chicago blogger CWBChicago—expanded the charges and claim that the actor lied to police who took his initial report as well as detectives who followed up later. The ABC station in Chicago confirmed the indictment with the Cook County State Attorney’s Office.

Smollett’s legal troubles began on Jan. 29 when he told police that he was attacked by two unknown men who struck him, called him racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, and placed a noose around his neck.

According to the indictment obtained by CWBChicago, Smollett told a detective in a follow-up interview that he fought back and all three men fell to the ground, and he felt someone pulling on his neck. He also told the officer that one of the attackers was a “white male wearing a black mask with an open area around his eyes that exposed his skin.”

The new charges against Smollett each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years if convicted. Smollett, 36, was written out of the last two episodes of the fifth season of Empire after his arrest.

Smollett is due in court for his arraignment on March 14. Smollett’s attorneys have said they intend to “mount an aggressive defense” on behalf of the actor."

Just when it looked as though former Empire star Jussie Smollett may have dodged the criminal charges that were filed last year and later dropped in the controversial case in which he allegedly faked an assault, he’s back in court again. This time, a Chicago grand jury indicted Smollett on six new charges as of Tuesday, which, according to court documents, allege that the actor “planned and participated” in staging a hate crime against himself.

It all started after midnight on January 29, 2019, the night Smollett says he was attacked on a Chicago street. The then-36-year-old told police that he was beaten outside of the Loews Hotel by two white men in ski masks who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, and championed “MAGA country,” as they tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

Due to the serious nature of the allegations, the Chicago police immediately began investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. They even tied a threatening letter that was reportedly sent to the actor prior to the alleged attack to the investigation. It contained anti-gay rhetoric and a mysterious white powder.

As news broke of what many were calling a shocking hate crime, many celebrities and politicians rallied behind the openly gay actor, both in the press and on social media. Former presidential candidate Kamala Harris even called the incident a “modern-day lynching,” while Smollett appeared on a television interview on ABC with Robin Roberts, where he reiterated that what he told police was unequivocally true.

It wasn’t until February 2019, when investigators uncovered a blurry video of two men walking near the supposed crime scene that the case took a very unexpected turn, one that would eventually cast suspicion on the actor himself. By February 20, a Cook County, Illinois, grand jury found probable cause that Smollett staged the attack. The young actor was arrested, charged with felony disorderly conduct, and released on bond shortly before being written off the hit show Empire. Smollett was also slapped with 16 more felony counts after allegedly lying to police about the alleged hate crime.

But then on March 26, 2019, prosecutors in the case abruptly dropped all charges against the actor, leading to a lot of questions and prompting a new investigation that took a sharp turn this week when Smollett was indicted for a second time.

Below, we’ve answered some of the biggest questions about why the case was reopened and whether Smollett could actually face jail time if convicted.

What is Smollett charged with now?

The actor is facing six new criminal charges, including that he planned and participated in the staging of a hate crime and made four separate false reports to the Chicago Police Department.

Who opened the new case and why?

Special prosecutor Dan K. Webb, who had been investigating the case for months, helped bring the new charges in Cook County after taking over from the former state’s attorney Kim Foxx who dropped the charges against Smollett last year. Her controversial decision shocked many and led to an unprecedented press conference by the Chicago Police Department in which it blasted the decision. Webb said that he’s pursuing the case against Smollett because “reasonable grounds exist to further prosecute the actor.”

What could happen next?

﻿With new criminal charges filed against Smollett, he will likely face a trial in Cook County unless he and his attorneys somehow make a deal with the prosecutors. At this time, there’s no evidence to suggest that the district attorney would even accept a deal, especially given the high-profile nature of the case.

Some big questions to consider if there is a criminal trial is how and where Smollett would be able to get a fair trial (this will likely become a major talking point for the actor’s legal team), what evidence would be submitted (is there a video of the alleged attack?), and who ultimately would take the stand (two brothers testified to a grand jury last year that Smollett hired them to stage the attack, and there is video of the men buying supplies that were allegedly used in the alleged attack).

In addition to the criminal charges, Smollett also faces a lawsuit from the City of Chicago to recover the costs of investigating “Mr. Smollett’s false statements,” according to TMZ. The actor has also since made a counterclaim against the city that is still pending.

He’s scheduled to appear in court on February 24.

Could Smollett end up in jail?

﻿Yes. The charge for filing a false police report is a felony in Illinois. Technically, it’s considered a Class 4 felony, the least serious of all possible felony charges, but it still carries a sentence ranging from one to three years in prison and fines up to $25,000.

If found guilty in a criminal trial, the actor could also be forced to pay restitution for the cost of the investigation, which, given the high-profile nature of the case, could be substantial.

Depending on what happens next, prosecutors could even add an obstruction-of-justice charge, which basically suggests that Smollett “knowingly” resisted or obstructed the work of an investigator (this charge also carries jail time).

How has Smollett reacted to the new charges?

﻿The actor’s legal team released a statement that says, in part: “This indictment raises serious questions about the integrity of the investigation that led to the renewed charges against Mr. Smollett … The attempt to re-prosecute Mr. Smollett one year later on the eve of the Cook County State’s Attorney election is clearly all about politics and not justice.”

So why were the first set of charges against Smollett dropped last year?

All of the criminal charges against the actor were dropped as of March 26, 2019 by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. While the prosecutors did not reveal why exactly they dropped the felony charges, they said the decision was made after reviewing all of the facts in light of Smollett’s forfeiture of his $10,000 bond. Usually when charges are dropped, the bond is returned to the defendant; in this case, Smollett agreed to give the bond he paid to the city, which is unusual in a case like this.

“After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case,” the state’s attorney’s office said in a statement at the time, “ including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community, and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.”

As a result, Smollett did not face trial and had his record expunged.

Weren’t there 16 different charges added to his initial charges last year?

Yes. On March 8, 2019, Smollett was charged with 16 additional felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. The grand jury specifically returned two separate sets of charges related to the actor’s allegations that his supposed attackers called him racist and homophobic slurs, used a noose, and poured a chemical on him. His testimony to police immediately after the incident, as well as his second interview with police, had both contributed to the last grand jury decision in 2019, the prosecutors said.

But all 16 of the additional charges were dropped as well on March 26, 2019. Smollett’s attorneys had also requested and were granted that the records be sealed.

What happened to the video evidence mentioned in the initial complaint?

Any and all evidence in this case would have been considered by the prosecutors and may have also led to the new charges being filed. At this time, it’s unclear whether any alleged video of the alleged attack exists or what evidence could or will be used in a criminal trial.

Did leaks and press appearances by the Chicago Police contribute to the decision to drop charges the first time around?

﻿It probably didn’t help. From the start, Smollett’s attorneys argued that the police overstepped when they initially held a press conference calling Smollett a criminal. His attorneys likely made the case behind closed doors that the actor being vilified by the police and press would have made it next to impossible for him to get a fair trial.

At the time, TMZ also reported that the Chicago Police were “furious” with the State’s decision to drop all of the charges. Former Police Superintendent Johnson said in a press conference on March 26, 2019 following the charges being dropped, “Do I think justice was served? No.”

In the same press conference, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel also called the decision to drop the charges “a whitewash of justice,” citing the grand jury’s decision to bring 16 felony charges after seeing “a sliver” of evidence. He accused the prosecutors of treating Smollett differently from other defendants because of his fame. A week later, the Chicago Police said they would be opening an investigation into the alleged leaks in this case.

The Chicago PD also released several police reports from the case after it was announced the charges were dropped. (The reports can be read here and here.) They reveal, in part, that Smollett was never handcuffed, placed into a cell, or “subjected to the media” while he was in custody.

The reports do not, however, include most of the materials related to this case. And that’s because a new court order has prevented the CPD from releasing any additional records, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “We were advised at 9:30 a.m. this morning [March 27] that the CPD records and investigative files are now under seal by order of the court,” he said at the time.

Was there any backlash after the charges were dropped last year?

Yes, there was criticism in both the political and legal worlds. On March 28, 2019, the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused the prosecutors of having “fundamentally misled the public on the law and circumstances surrounding the dismissal,” saying that the way in which the Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and her office resolved the case was “abnormal.”

The association specifically said: “The appearance of impropriety here is compounded by the fact that this case was not on the regularly scheduled court call, the public had no reasonable notice or opportunity to view these proceedings, and the dismissal was done abruptly at what has been called an ‘emergency’ hearing. To date, the nature of the purported emergency has not been publicly disclosed. The sealing of a court case immediately following a hearing where there was no reasonable notice or opportunity for the public to attend is a matter of grave public concern and undermines the very foundation of our public court system.”

The prosecutor’s office was also criticized by the association for suggesting that somehow sealing the records in this case was mandatory. And Foxx herself had been criticized for not properly recusing herself over having a personal tie to a witness, by appointing someone within her own office to take over the case; legal experts said a special prosecutor should have been appointed in the case.

There was also the financial expense of the case. The initial investigation cost the city a lot in man hours. As such, the Chicago corporation counsel asked on March 28, 2019 that Smollett be required to pay more than $130,000 for the cost of the investigation, while officials in both Illinois and the White House had even suggested there should be an investigation into why the charges were dropped in the first place. State House Republican Jim Durkin asked the state’s attorney general to do a “thorough review,” while President Trump tweeted, “FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago.”

The FBI and Justice Department were expected to evaluate the prosecutor’s involvement in the case after the police union also called for an investigation.

In addition, Republican State Representative from Chicago Michael McAuliffe introduced legislation that could prohibit any production that hires the actor from benefiting from the Illinois Film Tax Credits. “A lot of valuable Chicago Police Department (CPD) man hours and resources were wasted chasing down a bogus crime arranged by Smollett,” he said. “Hate crimes are serious and so is the time and effort of the CPD. He has cost Chicago a lot more than a $10,000 bond.”

As to the way the case was handled, well, the National District Attorneys Association also released a powerful statement: “The recent incident in Chicago involving actor Jussie Smollett is no different and has garnered national attention as the case has made its way through various phases of the investigation and prosecution process. …While details of the case remain sealed, several observations must be made in order to increase, not diminish, the public’s confidence in the criminal justice system.”

Ultimately, they advised that “when a chief prosecutor recuses him or herself, the recusal must apply to the entire office, not just the elected or appointed prosecutor;” “prosecutors should not take advice from politically connected friends of the accused;” “when a prosecutor seeks to resolve a case through diversion or some other alternative to prosecution, it should be done so with an acknowledgement of culpability on the part of the defendant. A case with the consequential effects of Mr. Smollett’s should not be resolved without a finding of guilt or innocence;” and “expunging Mr. Smollett’s record at this immediate stage is counter to transparency. Law enforcement will now not be able to acknowledge that Mr. Smollett was indicted and charged with these horrible crimes and the full record of what occurred will be forever hidden from public view.”

What evidence did the police say they had against Smollett in 2019?

During a press conference on February 21, 2019, Eddie Johnson, superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, said Smollett orchestrated and paid to stage the attack.

First, he said, Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter to himself. When that didn’t work, Smollett then paid $3,500 to two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack because, according to Johnson, Smollett “was dissatisfied with his salary” on the hit TV show Empire.

The two brothers Smollett allegedly hired, men he knew from working on Empire, were wearing gloves and punched the actor “a little bit,” Johnson said. He also said that phone records between Smollett and the two brothers show communication both before and after the staged attack.

Johnson also confirmed that the police had evidence of money payment in the form of the actual check Smollett paid the brothers. Smollett claimed the payment was for services rendered in the form of fitness training.

How did Chicago police come to the conclusion that Smollett orchestrated the attack?

Commander of the Chicago Police Department, Edward Wodnicki, outlined the timeline of the investigation during the February 21 press conference.

He said the investigation officially began at 2 a.m. on the morning of January 29, when Smollett first reported that he was the victim of a hate crime. The actor was initially interviewed at Northwestern Hospital.

“Jussie was not hurt,” said Wodnicki, other than a few scratches on his face and some bruising. He said it appeared that the scratches may have been self-inflicted.

The police interviewed more than 100 people in the area after the supposed attack.

“We quickly found two persons of interest on video that we believed were the likely offenders in this case,” said Wodnicki. About 35 different police cameras and 20 private-sector cameras were used to track the suspects. The two brothers seen in the video were eventually identified through a rideshare service they used to flee the scene.

On Friday, February 15, 2019, after 47 hours of the brothers being in custody, and hours of interrogation, they were no longer considered suspects in the case. Based on the evidence the brothers provided (including the payment from Smollett), the State Attorney’s Office approved charges against the actor.

Additionally, Smollett had been reluctant to meet with investigators for a follow-up interview. And while he has every legal right to not answer questions as per his attorney’s advice, some critics argued from the beginning that his story had holes in it, like the 40-minute gap between the supposed attack and when police were contacted.

Another red flag for investigators early on may have been when Smollett initially refused to turn his phone over to the police. At the time, the police were trying to establish a timeline of the attack based on Smollett’s own statement that he was speaking on the phone to his manager when the alleged attack happened. Though he eventually provided redacted phone records to investigators, it’s unclear if any of the phone records were edited. It appears that the phone records showing communication between Smollett and the brothers came from the brothers’ own phone records, which they handed over willingly.

What happened after Smollett was first charged?

Because Smollett was charged with making a false police report, a felony disorderly conduct charge that could bring jail time and/or monetary fines, he was booked by police and had a bond hearing on February 21.

During the hearing, Smollett faced a judge to officially make his plea. The judge granted a bond of which Smollett was required to pay $100,000 based on the defendant not being a danger to the community or a flight risk. (He paid 10 percent of that, as is standard.) He was also asked to surrender his passport.

How did Smollett respond after being arrested inititally?

The Empire actor has maintained his innocence from the beginning of the investigation. On March 14, 2019, he pled not guilty to all charges and denied any involvement in fabricating the attack.

On the night of February 20, his lawyers released a statement saying, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

They also added: “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

How did Smollett react after the charges were dropped?

﻿When the charges were dropped in 2019, Smollett spoke briefly outside the courthouse. He thanked his family and friends, the people of Chicago and around the world who supported him. He added:

I’ve been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. … This has been an incredibly difficult time. Honestly, one of the worst of my entire life. But I am a man of faith and a man who has knowledge of my history and would not bring my family, our lives and the movement through a fire like this. I just wouldn’t.

He also signed autographs and said he would continue to “fight for the betterment of marginalized people everywhere.”

His attorneys also said in a statement, “He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgment.”

The statement adds: “The entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that a victim, in this case, Jussie, deserves dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result.”

They said that Smollett is “relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.”

Would Smollett have faced jail time if he’d been convicted in 2019?

Yes. The charge for filing a false police report is a felony in Illinois. Technically, it’s considered a Class 4 felony, the least serious of all possible felony charges, but it still carries a sentence ranging from one to three years in prison and fines up to $25,000.

In order to have charged Smollett, the investigators needed to prove to the grand jury that he knowingly lied to police about the incident, which resulted in a false police report. The actor could also have been forced to pay restitution for the cost of the investigation, which, given the high-profile nature of the case, could have been substantial.

As this case moved forward, prosecutors may also have been considered adding an obstruction of justice charge, which basically would have meant that Smollett would have stood accused of “knowingly” resisting or obstructing the work of an investigator. This could have also carried jail time.

The 16 additional charges that were added (and since dropped) each also carried up to four years in jail or probation.

At that point, one of the best-case scenarios for the actor at the time would have been to plead to a misdemeanor to avoid prison time. But again, given the high-profile nature of the case, a judge may not have been been so lenient as to accept the plea. Smollett could have ended up facing a very public criminal trial. Even before he was formally charged, he hired two criminal-defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh, who said they intended to vigorously defend their client against all charges.

What about the threatening letter Smollett says he received last year?

Johnson said during the original press conference on February 21, 2019, that the police believed Smollett did fabricate the letter. Both the FBI and U.S. Postal inspectors were investigating the letter, which said, “You will die black faggot,” in cut-out magazine letters. It also featured a stick figure hanging from a tree.

At this point it’s unclear if Smollett will face any charges for the letter since the new charges were filed. If charges are brought, Smollett could be charged with federal mail fraud, which carries its own set of criminal charges beyond what he is already facing in the state of Illinois. To be convicted of mail fraud, a prosecutor would need to prove that the actor intended to perform a fraudulent act and that he used the mail purposely to execute it.

Charges for being convicted of mail fraud range from fines up to $250,000 to prison time up to 20 years. Other lesser options include probation or even making restitution. The penalty really depends on the severity of the case and the criminal history of the person or persons involved.

What happens when someone is charged with a felony?

A felony remains on a person’s criminal record for the duration of his life. It may preclude him from certain things, like being able to vote or even run for and hold political office. Felons are also disqualified from jury duty for at least seven years. Felons are also unable to own firearms.

In addition, felons risk losing permits or licenses for work depending on the nature of the crime. As a convicted felon, Smollett could be denied approval as a foster or adoptive parent. He would also very likely serve jail time, pay fines, or be put on probation. It will ultimately depend on a judge’s discretion and the seriousness of the charges.

Has Smollett had any other trouble with the law?

In 2007, Smollett pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor counts related to a DUI in Los Angeles. One of the counts was, interestingly, giving false information to the police.

The actor reportedly gave police a false name when he was arrested, that of his brother Jake. As such, he was charged with false impersonation, as well as driving under the influence and driving without a license. He was sentenced to three years’ probation. He also completed a mandatory alcohol-treatment program.

What’s happened to Smollett’s career since the alleged attack?

His bosses at Empire initially “removed” the actor’s character Jamal at the end of last season. At the time, Chris Alexander, a spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Television and the Fox network that produces the hit show, said in a statement, “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.” There have been no further comments from the network since the case has been reopened.

Smollett hasn’t been active on his official social-media accounts for quite some time. His last Twitter post was in early 2019, and he hasn’t posted to Instagram since June 2019. He’s retreated from public life with no news about either his singing or acting career.

A Chicago grand jury has returned a 16-count indictment against Empire actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime, according to multiple Chicago media reports.

Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month. But a true bill handed down on Thursday — and first reported by Chicago blogger CWB Chicago — expanded the charges, claiming that the actor lied to the police who took his initial report as well as to the detectives who followed up later. The ABC station in Chicago confirmed the indictment with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

Smollett’s legal troubles began on January 29, when he told police that he was attacked by two unknown men who struck him, called him racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, and placed a noose around his neck.

According to the indictment obtained by CWB Chicago, Smollett told a detective in a follow-up interview that he fought back, that all three men fell to the ground, and that he felt someone pulling on his neck. He also told the officer that one of the attackers was a “white male wearing a black mask with an open area around his eyes that exposed his skin.”

The new charges against Smollett each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years, if convicted. Smollett, 36, was written out of the last two episodes of the fifth season of Empire after his arrest. Smollett is due in court for his arraignment on March 14.

Attorney Mark Geragos, who presents Smollett, issued a statement on his behalf Friday night. “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Chicago police confirmed to Vulture on Friday that they have opened an internal investigation into the leaks. “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Sgt. Rocco Alioto said in a statement. “As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”"

But a Chicago grand jury - which decides charges in major cases - has applied that charge a further 15 times over in an 86-page indictment filed on Thursday.

Smollett, 36, claimed that two white men set upon him in the city - yelling racist and homophobic abuse and placing a noose around his neck.

While not carrying additional prison time should he be convicted, each fresh charge brings a maximum probation sentence of four years.

Neither Smollett's legal team or prosecutors in Cook County, the Chicago district which brought the charges, have commented.



'RACE HATE HOAX'

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama is accused of lying to cops about the supposed race-hate attack in Chicago.

He claimed he was set-upon by two Trump supporters in the early hours of January 29.

Smollett reported to police that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

'TRUMP SUPPORTERS'

They then struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled, he alleged.

The supposed attackers had shouted ""This is MAGA country"" - referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But the two men were found to be associates of Smollett and cops said the actor had staged the beating to improve his £77,000-an-episode TV contract.

By Suzannah Gonzales

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that levelling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologised last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season."

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

ADVERTISEMENT

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

March 7

—A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count indictment charging Smollett with falsely reporting an offense.

He faces 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office confirmed to WLS-TV in Chicago.

""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time ... there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" the indictment said, according to WBBM-TV in Chicago.

Smollett came under scrutiny over the past several weeks after he told police two men attacked him while yelling racial slurs and saying this is ""MAGA country"" -- a reference to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan. The actor-singer was hospitalized with cuts and bruises after he said the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and put a noose around his neck.

But after several weeks of investigation, Chicago police said Smollett staged the attack.

The grand jury returned two indictments for Smollett, one stemming from his initial report of the attack and another from a second interview he gave police. Each charge carries a sentence of up to four years of probation.

Meanwhile, Chicago police want to know who leaked information about the department's investigation into Smollett to the media.

The internal investigation is looking at the interrogation of two brothers, who police said were paid by Smollett to stage a fake attack on him to garner sympathy and fame. Police said Abel Osundairo and Ola Osundairo were paid $3,500 via personal check with a memo line that reads ""personal training.""

Details of the police questioning were leaked to the media at some point. No alleged leakers have been identified, and no Chicago police officers have been disciplined. State police, prosecutors and federal agents all the way to court clerk's staff had access to the details of the case, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

""I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time, and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,"" Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday evening. ""These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.""

Police had obtained a search warrant that led to the check and have text messages between Smollett and the brothers. Smollett was initially charged with a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report and was arrested. He pleaded not guilty. He is free on $100,000 bail."

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment - eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective - comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

""The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what's called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,"" Geragos told NBC's ""Access"" after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck - a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment of Smollett."

Smollett had been charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct in February after Chicago police said they had evidence that he had filed a false police report.

He faces probation and up to four years in jail for each count.

Smollett initially claimed that he had been attacked by two masked men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, doused him with a chemical, and stuck a noose on his neck.

However the investigation turned against him when police interviewed two men who had been caught on surveillance video and they accused Smollett of orchestrating the fake attack in order to garner sympathy for the ""Empire"" actor.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was previously charged in a criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack on Jan. 29 by supporters of President Donald Trump.Smollett's character was removed from the final two episodes of the hip-hop drama ""Empire"" after he was arrested and charged with staging a hoax hate crime attack on himself, according to show officials.""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and, to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season,"" 20th Century Fox Television said in a statement.Smollett claimed that he was assaulted and called racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago Police claimed they have reason to believe that the actor orchestrated the event, according to a New York Times report.The Empire star was reportedly attacked by two masked figures, later said to be brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. They, however, told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax.“After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, confirming that the brothers are no longer suspects.One of the brothers, both of whom were detained, was an extra on Smollett’s television show. By the weekend, both brothers were released without charges.Smollett had previously claimed that he believed the attackers were supporters of US President Donald Trump.The Empire star was taken into custody after police discovered that the actor planned the alleged attack on himself due to dissatisfaction with his salary.The move came a day after the 36-year-old was charged with lying to Chicago police about the allegedly staged incident, in which he said two masked men beat him and slung a noose around his neck while yelling racist and homophobic abuse.Smollett faces up to three years in prison if convicted in the case, which fueled political divisions that have roiled the United States since Donald Trump's 2016 election.""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" the show's co-creators and producers said in a statement. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""Lawyers for Smollett did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.According to police, the actor, who is black and openly gay, paid two brother $3,500 to attack him on Jan. 29 in the hope of advancing his career and because he was unhappy with salary.Police did not spell out how he hoped to boost his salary by staging such a hoax.While the actor initially received an outpouring of support on social media, others were skeptical about the attack, which he said took place outside his Chicago apartment at 2 a.m. on a frigid night.In his account, Smollett said his attackers also shouted ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.The Jewish actor apparently ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" according to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.Smollett has already received backlash for the accusations. Donald Trump, Jr. said, “It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad, and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.”“The Smollett story isn’t about conservatives pouncing,” wrote political commentator Ben Shapiro. “It’s about an insane hoax propped up and promulgated as ‘Trump’s America’ for political purposes.”Ryan Fournier, a political commentator and the chairman of Students for Trump, said, “This is how mentally insane the Left has become. They will do anything to bring us down. Well it’s not happening, because Jussie is going to jail.”Smollet also provided false information to Los Angeles law enforcement authorities in 2007, and police in Chicago have requested details regarding the case after Smollett was accused of faking a self-inflicted hate-crime upon himself.According to a Washington Times report, the actor pleaded no contest to these charges in 2007, including a DUI and driving without a license. He received two years probation for his actions.The actor’s attorneys released a statement on Saturday, claiming “Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement continued. “Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”""Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,"" his attorneys continued.""What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments?!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning in response to the new developments in Smollett's case."

The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

Smollett’s legal troubles will likely not end with the 16 felonies as the FBI is reportedly investigating a letter sent to the “Empire” set that contained a white powder and threatened Jussie.

If the agency concludes Smollett was behind the anonymous letter, he could be facing federal charges.

Additionally, Infowars exclusively reported the FBI is looking into whether or not the actor’s many Democratic politician friends were involved in any capacity.

Infowars covered the Smollett saga closely and was among the first media outlets to see the hoax for what it was.

According to CBS 2 Chicago, a grand jury returned the charges against Smollett on Thursday. The counts, which are Class 4 felonies, focus on the allegedly false statements he gave to two different Chicago Police officers.

As CBS noted, “Each count covers various alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers – including that he was hit by two men, that they yelled racial and homophobic slurs and poured a chemical on him.”

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time…there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment reportedly stated.

Smollett is scheduled to be arraigned on March 14.

Smollett claimed that he was attacked on January 29, at 2 a.m., by two men wearing Make America Great Again hats. He said they yelled a gay slur at him, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Now, police believe Smollett orchestrated the attack.

During a previous press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett “paid $3,500 to stage this attack” and that “The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary.”

Since then, Smollett has reportedly been written out of the last two episodes of the upcoming Empire season.

The decision was announced back in February. Executives made the move to remove Smollett’s character on the show — Jamal Lyon — from the last two episodes of the season to avoid upsetting the cast and crew members on set.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” said the network’s executive producers.

Chicago – A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment – eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective – comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding.I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive than the first because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was white. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was charged last month. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers he paid $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective that one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck – a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes.

CHICAGO — A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday says he made a false report about an offense.

The Cook County State's Attorney charged Smollett on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Smollett told police in late January that he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor said the men shouted at him, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him. Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

After an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack."

CBS Chicago notes that each count against Smollett pertains to ""separate alleged acts that Smollett falsely described to the officers.""

He was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct and released on $100,000 bail.

The actor reported in late January he had been viciously attacked by two men but detectives later determined that he allegedly set up the highly publicized attack to further his career.

Smollett and his attorneys deny the actor has anything to do with the assault other than being the victim of a hate crime.

According to police, two brothers helped Smollett orchestrate the faux assault and are now working with detectives to build the department’s case against the Empire actor.

Chicago police have also opened an internal investigation to determine who leaked information about the Jussie Smollett case. Sgt. Rocco Alioto said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter,

“I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation. As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.“

Smollett, who was arrested last month on a criminal complaint with a single count of disorderly conduct, will be arraigned on the new charges on Thursday.

The indictment, which was made public on Friday, cites Smollett with disorderly conduct for each crime he said he had suffered, with separate counts related to statements he made the night of Jan. 29 to a police officer, and then for repeating the same account to a detective the same night. The charges all are Class 4 felonies, the lowest category of felony offense under Illinois law.

In high-profile cases, adding counts to the initial criminal complaints are not uncommon, either as a hedge against making a case in the most serious charges at trial, to send a message to the defendant, or both.

In a statement, Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos said while the indictment is “not unexpected…What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

The Chicago Sun-Times reported Thursday that police have opened an internal investigation into the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the department’s investigation and that a Northwestern Memorial Hospital employee said that she and possibly others were fired for inappropriately accessing Smollett’s records, violating hospital rules.

The actor said that he was attacked by two men near his home in the Streeterville neighborhood after getting a sandwich from a Subway franchise at around 2 a.m. His attackers, the actor said, hurled homophobic and racist slurs as the hit him, poured an what appeared to be bleach on him, and put a thin noose around his neck.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said he had been targeted because of his activism, and two weeks after the alleged attack, went on “Good Morning America” and gave a tearful interview in which he expressed outrage over leaks to the media and doubters who questioned his story on social media.

Chicago police investigated the case for three weeks, eventually identifying two brothers with ties to Smollett— one had worked his personal trainer, and both had been extras on episodes of “Empire”— as his “attackers.” After 47 hours in police custody, the pair told police that Smollett has paid them $3,500 to stage the attack, in an effort to raise the actor’s profile and win him a higher salary for his role on the TV show.

Smollett surrendered to police on Feb. 21 and has remained free on $100,000 bond. A spokeswoman for his legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Just today, a grand jury handed down indictments against the actor and while they are lengthy, Smollett may not have to serve one day of time for his alleged actions.

ABC 7 Chicago reports:

A Cook County grand jury has returned a 16-count indictment against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, according to court records. The Cook county State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment, which they said was returned by a grand jury on Thursday. […] The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him. The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

According to CWBChicago, Smollett could get off the hook as far as jail time goes:

The new charges against Smollett each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years if convicted. Realistically, though, Smollett is unlikely to be convicted on more than a fraction of the charges. Most Cook County criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains in which a defendant pleads guilty to one and, rarely, two counts of an indictment in return for a favorable sentence. Only by going to trial do most defendants run the real risk of being convicted of more than one or two counts.

In related news, the Chicago PD have started another investigation into the media leaks on the case:

In another aspect of the case, Chicago police have opened an internal investigation to determine who leaked information about the Smollett case, the department confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter on Friday.

Originally, Smollett was charged last month with a felony charge of filing a false police report.

Though it’s really disheartening to find out he may not have to serve time if convicted of all of these charges, The Daily Wire points out Smollett still may face federal charges as well:

Unfortunately for Smollett, he is also awaiting the outcome of a Federal investigation involving the United States Postal Inspector, over whether Smollett mailed a threatening letter, containing a “white powder” that turned out to be crushed Tylenol, to himself using the United States Postal Service.

Smollett is currently out on bond, and is scheduled to be in court on March 14th.

This is a developing story. Stay tuned for updates.

Even if he makes a deal, how do they let him go with no time served after the grand jury threw the book at him?

“16 felony charges against Smollett for his hoaxed hate-crime is exactly the sort of overkill you get from a Chicago Grand Jury when you have messed with the entire city’s sense of civic pride,” says Jeff Blehar. That’s my instinct too. The grand jurors resented the embarrassment he caused by pinning a hate attack on Chicago, felt annoyed at the time and money he wasted by sending investigators on a wild goose chase, and wanted to signal that hoax crimes aren’t a trivial offense.

Jussie’s gonna get a longer sentence than Manafort.

The grand jury’s true bill states that Smollett lied about the attack to two separate police officers–the beat cop who took his initial report and a detective who conducted a follow-up interview the same day. In one set of charges, the grand jury found that Smollet filed a false police report around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29th in which he told an officer that he was attacked near 341 East Lower North Water Street by two unknown men who were dressed in black and one of whom wore a ski mask. The jury further found that Smollett told the original officer that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs and struck him in the face with their hands. The police report connected to these charges also indicate that Smollett claimed that a noose had been placed around his neck and a “chemical” had been poured on him. The second set of charges returned by the grand jury involves Smollett’s alleged false reporting of the incident to a police detective later the same day. Additional details that Smollett apparently included in the second interview include: the men approached him from behind, Smollett fought back, and all three men fell to the ground where Smollett said he was kicked in the back and felt someone pulling on his neck. During this interview, Smollett also told the officer that one offender was a white male wearing a black mask with an open area around the eyes that exposed the attacker’s skin, the grand jury found.

That’s from CWB Chicago, which notes that Cook County defendants typically plead down to one or two counts. “Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison,” notes ABC. Would the D.A. be content with that outcome at this point, though? Why not threaten to take him to trial if he won’t accept jail time?

The answer, I assume, is that it’s always risky to go to court against a celebrity, even a minor celebrity like Smollett who’s alienated many of the people who went to bat for him after he first reported the “assault.” And Smollett’s shameless enough to claim some sort of prejudice against him if the D.A. insisted on trying the case. If you’re willing to invent a hate crime for sympathy, you’re willing to claim that an effort to make an example of a hate hoaxster is just another case of the system doling out extra punishment to a black, gay defendant. It’s not worth the aggravation to the D.A.

Maybe they could make it a condition of his probation that he films a PSA admitting he’s a lying dipsh*t? Run it during commercial breaks on “Empire.” Speaking of which, how much embarrassment do the producers of the show want to endure? Sixteen felony counts might not cost him his freedom but they may cost him his job."

This article was published 8/3/2019 (473 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

FILE - In this May 20, 2016 file photo, actor and singer Jussie Smollett attends the ""Empire"" FYC Event in Los Angeles. Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into ""Empire"" actor Smollett's claims he was attacked.

CHICAGO - A grand jury in Chicago indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment ""prosecutorial overkill."" He said Smollett ""adamantly maintains his innocence.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,"" Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett's account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker's mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

""He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett's bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had ""no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.""

Since Smollett's arrest, the producers of ""Empire"" announced that the actor's character would be removed from the season's final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces ""Empire"" had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

The indictment, filed on Thursday and obtained by USA TODAY, alleges he repeatedly lied to Chicago police about being the victim of a homophobic and racist attack in January.

Smollett, who is scheduled to be arraigned on March 14, is charged with 16 counts of ""false report of offense.”

The Class 4 felonies are described almost identically, except for the names of police officers, in that Smollett is accused of ""knowingly"" telling police that he was the victim of a ""battery, a hate crime and an aggravated battery"" and that he knew at the time ""there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.""

Late Friday, Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement to USA TODAY that the indictment was ""not unexpected,"" adding, ""we knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.""

Geragos added: ""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

Smollett told Chicago police that he was attacked in the middle of the night on a downtown street by masked men shouting homophobic and racist abuse. In February, after weeks of police investigation, he was charged with one Class 4 felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about the alleged attack.

Now a county grand jury has deepened his legal woes by adding 15 more counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged false police report.

Smollett has been out on bail after his initial arrest. He denies he lied to police or anyone else about what he says happened to him on Jan. 29.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx did not immediately issue a statement.

Chicago police spokesman Antony Guglielmi tweeted a comment from the CPD:

""As Supt. (Eddie) Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors,"" the tweet read.

Smollett was charged with one count on Feb. 20 by police, who alleged that he had paid two brothers who were his friends more than $3,000 to stage the attack as a ploy to raise his profile to get a raise in his salary on ""Empire.""

Smollett surrendered to police and was arrested the next day, and was released later after posting $100,000 bail following a hearing.

After his arrest, “Empire” producers announced his character would be removed from the final two episodes of the Fox drama’s current season.

The Fox studio and network declined to comment on the latest news in the Smollett case.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with 16 felony counts of felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

The telly star, 36, is accused of hiring thugs to beat him up to stage a race hate crime in a desperate bid to boost his career.

Today, the case went in front of a grand jury in Chicago and they added 15 additional counts to the one charge he was already facing.

He now faces a maximum sentence of three years behind bars, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probabtion.

The indictment breaks down the charges into all the times Smollett allegedly lied to police about being beaten up by racist bullies back in January.

He's currently free on $100,000 bail.

The actor, who played Jamal in Empire, hit headlines when he previously alleged he was the victim of a racially motivated and homophobic attack in which two men beat him and looped a noose around his neck.

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, even made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America declaring he had been ""forever changed"" by the alleged incident.

Chicago police chiefs later alleged he made the story up in a bid to get a pay rise out of his bosses at Empire.

TV chiefs at 20th Century Fox TV have since confirmed the actor has been written out of the show.

A statement posted on Twitter reveale: ""Please find a new statement from Empire Executive Producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer...

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us...

“Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out...

“.We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.

Things have gone from bad to worse for Jussie Smollett. The “Empire” actor’s been indicted on 16 felony counts in connection to that allegedly false hate crime report. CBS Chicago reports that a grand jury returned the disorderly conduct indictment on Thursday. All of the “false report of offense” charges are class 4 felonies.

Jussie was originally only facing a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report which could carry a three-year sentence plus fines.

This comes after the Chicago PD announced that they’re conducting an internal investigation into those leaks surrounding the case. They admit that some of the leaked information was “not factually accurate.”

Jussie will be arraigned on March 14.

The news apparently comes as a surprise to Jussie’s legal team.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported that he was attacked on Jan. 28 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment – eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective – comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

Indictments like the one revealed Friday are common in criminal cases. It was widely expected, said Mark Geragos, a prominent attorney representing Smollett.

“The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding. I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing,” Geragos told NBC’s “Access” after the indictment was reported.

Smollett, who was released on bail from jail the day after he was charged on Feb. 20, is scheduled to appear in court next week. He has denied the allegations.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck – a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offence had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment of Smollett."

On Thursday, March 14, actor Jussie Smollett entered a not guilty plea regarding the case which alleges he lied to police about a hate crime.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Smollett — who was indicted on 16 felony counts — is claiming innocence once again. More details are sure to arise as the proceedings continue.

ORIGINAL STORY (3/8/2019):

After weeks of back-and-forth and confusing details Empire's Jussie Smollett has officially been indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly filing a false police report about a hate crime.

The actor was charged with felony disorderly conduct and released on $100,000 bail back in February after his initial report was believed to be false. In January, Smollett claimed he was attacked on the streets of Chicago by two men who shouted pro-Trump rhetoric and racist and homophobic remarks before tying a noose around his neck and pouring an unknown liquid on him.

After a few weeks of investigation, Chicago police determined Smollett's report to be false and was made in an effort to help his career and boost his Empire salary. Smollett's arrest quickly followed but the actor and his attorney vehemently deny that he had any part in orchestrating the event, maintaining he's a victim.

The suspects who were apprehended were quickly released after it was believed Smollett paid the brothers to stage the incident. Now, those two men are reportedly working with detectives as they build their case against Smollett.

Since his arrest and recent suspension from Empire, the actor has remained off the radar as he's due back in court on March 14 to address the disorderly conduct charge. Stay tuned for more as news about Smollett's case unfolds."

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama Empire, was previously charged in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack on Jan 29 by supporters of President Donald Trump.

A spokeswoman for Smollett, 36, who was arrested and later released on US$100,000 (S$130,000) bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him, did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.

An attorney for the actor could not immediately be reached for comment.

At least two local television stations reported that a Cook County grand jury charged Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly giving false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago's police chief said that Smollett had paid two brothers to stage an assault on him.

According to previous police accounts, Smollett reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

According to the account, the attackers had shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Happy Clapback Day!

From now on, I will only refer to the day between Thursday and Saturday as “Clapback Day.” I’ve done the etymological research and discovered that the day was named after the Greek god of hot grease, Frysomethis.

It’s not that I want to censor or outlaw the old name. But, as a paleo-vegan (I only eat animals that don’t eat meat), I feel that the day should commemorate the day The Root responds to our readers’ emails, tweets and messages.

As such, today’s clapbacks are dedicated to people who get angry at writers at The Root for our choice of words .

Here’s a letter from a reader who took issue with an article on Jussie Smollett. In particular, the woman was incensed by Jay Connor’s use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE):

From: Monica

To: The Root I am extremely shocked and disturbed by your March 2nd article discussing the two brothers involved in the Smollett saga. The article was riddled with stereotypical vernacular and slang. What is appalling is that your writers made generalised blanket claims which were biased. The first paragraph included a line that the term “What had happened was” is a staple in black households. How offensive, I am black, and no one in my household has ever used that term. The mere fact that your writers believe they have to dumb down their articles and use slang in order to reach a certain demographic of readers is pathetic. I know educated black people may seem anomalous to your writers, but we do exist. I wonder if you dumb down your articles when discussing Jewish individuals ? I know the answer to that question. You have definitely missed the mark with this article, and this will be posted on social media.



Dear Monica,

Props to you on your use of correct English. I am sorry if you couldn’t understand Jay’s article because you were not educated in Blackanese. In addition, I’m sorry that you consider black people to be stupid. I’m going to pray for you.

Advertisement

The Root is written for and by black people. When Jewish people inject Yiddish phrases into their conversations with each other, are they dumbing it down? How about when white people from Texas like Dwight Eisenhower or George Bush say “Y’all”? Is that dumb, too? When Donald Trump is speaking his unique dialect of gibberish or when British immigrants speak in Cockney accents and phrases, do you view them the same way? Are you arguing that the article was unintelligible?

Nah, I know what this is about. You’re not ashamed of the grammar. You’re ashamed of the blackness.

Advertisement

While there is much dispute about the origins of AAVE, no one argues about the history of racism and linguistic prejudice. The only difference between African American speech and what you obviously believe is the correct way to talk is that, unlike you, some black people are not ashamed of it. Talking and writing in this manner does not mean that we cannot understand the white man’s language. We live in America. We wear the mask.

As educated as you are, I’d like to introduce you to some writers like Mark Twain, who wrote in a Southern dialect; Niccolò Machiavelli, who wrote in a regional dialect; or Pulitzer winner Junot Diaz, who infuses his Dominican heritage into his writing. I’ll be sure to tell Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison and Alice Walker how dumb they are. In fact, I’ll just send them a quick note that says:

“What had happened was ... A self-hating negro who thinks the white man’s ice is colder wanted to know why you think she’s so stupid.”

You have definitely missed the mark with this email, and this will be posted on social media .

I don’t think this refers to any particular article:

From: Bob

To: Michael Harriot (Sorry if this isn’t the best address to contact you for this sort of thing, but I don’t use Twitter, FB, etc.) First, I want to say, without any sarcasm, thank you for helping a white person like me begin to understand the vastness of my own ignorance and my racism. I have particularly found your ideas about being steeped in racism due to growing up in a racist culture to be incredibly valuable. I try to do better. I can’t promise I’ll succeed, but I’ll try. One of the most immediately enlightening things I learned from reading The Root is the absolute hollowness of the “some of my best friends” excuse. It is horrifying how often it shows up in various forms (“my employees”, “my nieces and nephews”, etc. That’s just from the Cohen hearing last week.). And I’ll admit to having been guilty of the same thing in the past. “I have a black friend”, “My chess mentor is black”, “I’ve played a lot of spades with black people”, etc. And I definitely grew up in a lily white area of the suburbs.

I have a few questions, if you have the time and will please forgive any accidental insult on my part:

1. What’s the singular of “wypipo”? I think it might be Todd, but it also might be Becky. Your opinion?

2. Do you consider the NAACP a worthwhile organization to join for a white person trying to fight racism (or at least trying to minimize the extent to which they might be accidentally making it worse)? I looked into BLM, but there’s nothing close to me (2+ hour drive each way).

3. I know you’ve touched on the topic before, but what’s the best way for white people to help the fight for equality? I try to politely point out instances of racism to friends and family, but unfortunately that tends to turn them off, so I want to help, but the prospect of alienating everyone I know because of their casual ignorance is rather painful to say the least. And I want to say sorry. I’m not a spokesman for all white people, but we’re full of shit, and we need to acknowledge it, but we don’t. So, sorry.

Dear Bob,

Unlike “white people,” there is no singular form of “ wypipo .” It is like “pants” or “scissors.” There is a difference between white people and “ wypipo .” For instance, when a lone Caucasian notified the authorities about two black men lounging in Starbucks, the correct way to express that sentiment would be: “ Wypipo called the cops.” But 57 percent of white people voted for Trump. Find out what is important to you and find an organization that specifically addresses those concerns. The NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund is out there fighting voter suppression, education inequality and racial profiling. So do you consider the NAACP a worthwhile organization? Imagine if one of your friends or family members had a communicable disease that was curable, but they were keeping secret. If they refused treatment, would you put yourself at risk? Would you point it out to your family members? Would you call them out for spreading their sickness? Because that’s what racism is .

Our article on Amanda Seales garnered a variety of responses but I wanted to address one overwhelmingly common complaint in particular.

Advertisement

Dear all,

A few hours after this article was published, I was informed of some very bad news:

Advertisement

After I wept into my tear recycling cup about losing Seales’ support, I reminisced about that time she laughed at something I wrote, then I dried my tears and began the long journey toward this new Amanda-less life. But the fact that she did not refute the argument before blocking us, nor has she addressed her libelous statements is not what I want to discuss.

Nor do I want to dissect the criticism I received about libel versus slander, because legally, if someone publishes audio or video of a defamatory remark, “it is actually considered to be libel because it is published in a transfixed form.” As for me minimizing Seales’ talent, I will not address the people who insist that Amanda Seales’ HBO comedy special was hilarious. You’re on your own.

Advertisement

If you think the article minimizes rape culture, that was not my intent. It was also not an attempt at silencing women. I have often written about the importance of listening to victims but also believe part of that responsibility is being careful with public accusations. We must acknowledge more than one things can be true at one time. It is possible that more people should speak out against sexual violence and that we shouldn’t publicly accuse people of undefined negative acts without proof. However, that is not the subject that I want to address.

I want to offer a sincere apology to the people who read the article about false accusations, celebrity and social media and found one aspect of it totally disgusting. For the rest of my writing career, I will faithfully attempt to get over this mistake and I hope our readers will find a way to overlook the libelous, offhand remark that I made without thinking. I was wrong and I deserve your contempt.

Advertisement

I deserve to be shamed for jumping to conclusions. It doesn’t mean you should cancel me just because I said something stupid. I’m a good person with a good heart. For me to make these baseless accusations without checking the details derailed the entire point. I shouldn’t have said it publicly without the facts and evidence. I hope you can forgive me. But I will face my blunder and proudly admit to the one thing that angered a lot of people:

Venom is not poison.

Frogs are not reptiles .

I have no idea why I began receiving DMs about an old article aimed at white people who say the n-word. Was there a convention or something?

Advertisement

From: Kyle

To: Michael Harriot I just completed reading your article about whites saying the n word. I’m dissapointed because I would’ve thought by the end of the article you would maybe provide one thing worth reading, but you didn’t. After reading it, however, I feel compelled to tell you, in case no one has before, that you are a blatant racist. You’re a joke. You hate white people with a passion and you should be ashamed of how much hatred is in your heart. If you have any care for your self and dignity, you would delete that piece of shit sorry excuse for an article. But I know you won’t, you’ll stand by your garbage. You’re a very sad man.

From: Led

To: Michael Harriot. Nigger. There’s such a thing called free speech. You should learn about it. If whites can’t say the n-word neither can blacks.

From: Mike C.

To: Michael H. Michael, I read your article “Why It’s OK for Black People, but Not White People, to Use the N-Word, Explained (Again)“ I am caucasian and so is my 7 year old son. Of course some of the logic you use, (pooping in someone else’s house) or (choking someone else’s wife who likes rough sex), helps build context for me to understand it’s your word to use... How do I explain to my 1st grade son, that the dark skinned (could be Hmong, Black or dark skinned Asian) get to use the n-word but he cannot? The concepts of not being able to use someone elses ____ when they can don’t translate well to a young person. Need help as this is going on daily on the bus by one little boy and we’re struggling to how to explain it to our son that he can’t do it but this other little boy gets to shout it out to anyone he wants to. It’s a “motherfucker” of a word and I wish it could go away or never have existed in the first place, but so is the c_unt word or the b_itch word. And you and I can’t use either of those, unless you are ready for one heck of a lot of woman anger to be thrust down upon you.

Advertisement

Dear Mike, Jesse and Kyle,

I believe my position on the n-word has been misinterpreted.

I absolutely believe white people can say the n-word.

I recognize the fact that it’s hard for you and your ancestors to say it all willy-nilly for 400 years and then erase it like the history of white supremacy is just a shakeable Etch-a-Sketch. I know that only white people are allowed to erase words from the collective vocabulary like how you transformed “slavery” into “states rights,” “racism” into “tradition,” and “Islamophobia” and “homophobia” into “religious freedom.”

Advertisement

Everyone can use the n-word. It is your right.

It is also the right of others to consider you a racist who hates black people when you say it.

Advertisement

Here’s an apt analogy:

In Buddhism, there is a symbol that represents the footsteps of Buddha. That same symbol was also used on ancient Mesopotamian coins, on Navajo clothes, African pottery and in the Sanskrit language. Then someone made it a symbol of hate and ruined it forever.

Advertisement

It is called the swastika.

Buddhists, Navajo people and Indians are free to wear a swastika armband around Jews. But any decent person who is even partially aware of the history behind that symbol wouldn’t wear it around Jewish people. If one chooses to do so knowing the legacy of the Nazi party, it should be assumed that it is an act of antagonism or hate. That assumption is only fair. Now, as far and understanding why black people can use it, here is the important part:

Why do you give a fuck?

The incontrovertible evidence of white supremacy is that white people are constantly roiled by the sheer existence of something that they cannot have for themselves. I now realize that white people infuse their children with this little speck of unexplained superiority and watch it grow.

Advertisement

My children must know that as a black person in America, there are certain things they cannot do. They cannot openly carry a firearm like white men can. They cannot speak to police (or any authority figure) in the same way their white friends do. They cannot linger in convenience stores at night or be alone with a white woman without supervision. They cannot assume that education and hard work alone will get them anything. To achieve anything they must be better than the next white man. Not equal—better.

But white people don’t understand this fact. They don’t languish over the fact that they can’t fly like birds or breathe underwater like a fish. Only white people infested with the virus of white supremacy wonder why they can’t own or rule over everything. They believe everything on the earth should be available to them. And if it is not, they will take it.

Advertisement

Mike, your son should know not to stick a fork in an electrical socket or put his hand on the stove. Did you have to shock or burn him to teach him this? Does he assume he can punch people in the face? Does he urinate in public? Does he know that he can do and say some things to you that he can’t say to strangers? Does he struggle to understand the difference between the women’s and men’s bathroom?

What?

You mean to tell me that you were somehow able to teach your child that there are social and natural boundaries that are off limits to them? That there are things they shouldn’t do because it will reflect negatively upon them? That there are rules and norms?

How the fuck did you do that?

Do you think you could do it again?

Love,

A real nigga."

Smollett was arrested last month on one count of the same crime. The new charges cover the actor’s alleged false report of a violent hate crime in January and alleged false statements to police in a secondary interview. Smollett claimed and has publicly maintained that he was attacked by two masked men yelling racial and homophobic slurs outside his Chicago apartment, while police and prosecutors have claimed the attack was a hoax.

Smollett pleaded not guilty to the first change and was released from police custody on $100,000 bond. In the days following his arrest, Empire reportedly wrote Smollett’s character out of the show’s final two episodes of season five to “avoid further disruption on set.” The actor and singer stands accused of staging the attack with the help of two brothers who also worked on the Fox series. Prosecutors have claimed that Smollett planned the scene, paid the brothers for the rope, masks, bleach, and other materials used during the altercation, and wrote a $3,500 check as an advance payment. He has denied lying about the attack and his attorneys have stated they plan to “mount an aggressive defense.”"

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

CHICAGO (AP) — A grand jury in Chicago indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment dated Thursday and made public on Friday gives details of the disorderly conduct charge against Smollett. It elaborates on the allegation that he falsely reported he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the black and openly gay actor, beat him, threw an unidentified liquid chemical on him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The indictment — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack and eight for what he later told a detective — comes a little more than two weeks after prosecutors announced one felony count of the same charge.

Chicago police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime but later said Smollett staged the attack, recruiting two brothers to carry it out, because he was unhappy with his pay on the Fox show.

An attorney for Smollett, Mark Geragos, called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” He said Smollett “adamantly maintains his innocence.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department,” Geragos said.

During the investigation of the incident, several Chicago media reported that there were doubts about Smollett’s account, quoting unnamed sources. Some local media have reported that the police department is investigating alleged leaks.

While it was not immediately clear why the grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts, it divides what prosecutors and police say the actor told the officer who responded to the initial call from what he said to the detective.

The second eight counts are more explosive because they include two things that helped propel the incident into an international sensation. The first is that by the time he talked to the detective, Smollett said he could see through the eye holes of one attacker’s mask that he was a white man. The two brothers who allegedly participated are black.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, told reporters the day Smollett was initially charged. Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers $3,500 to carry out the staged attack.

The second eight counts also include the allegation that Smollett told the detective one of the attackers looped a rope around his neck — a detail that both Johnson and the judge who set Smollett’s bond said was a particularly offensive use of a symbol of the ugly history of black lynchings in the United States.

The indictment, written in the dry legal language, does not include new details.

It says that Smollett knew at the time he relayed his account that he had “no reasonable ground that such an offense had been committed.”

Since Smollett’s arrest, the producers of “Empire” announced that the actor’s character would be removed from the season’s final two episodes. Fox network and the studio that produces “Empire” had no immediate comment on the latest indictment.

Smollett was previously charged with one count related to making a false police report. On Friday, a grand jury in Cook County, Illinois, expanded the case against the Empire star, finding enough evidence for him to face additional charges related to lying to multiple police officials and filing the false report.

The number of charges was overkill, Smollett's lawyer Mark Geragos said in a statement.

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records,"" he said. ""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Smollett told Chicago police that he had been attacked in the early hours of Jan. 29 by two men who threw a chemical at him, put a rope around his neck, called him anti-gay slurs, and referenced President Trump's MAGA slogan.

""Jussie Smollett knew that ... there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" the grand jury said.



The case made national headlines and prompted sympathy for Smollett as well as calls for people to stand against hate. But as police investigated, questions arose about whether there was evidence the attack had actually happened.

Smollett insisted on Good Morning America that he was telling the truth, adding he was ""pissed off"" by the doubt he faced.



On Feb. 15, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were detained and, according to local media, told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. An attorney for the brothers pushed back against the accuracy of those reports, but she did not provide more details about what the Osundairos had told authorities.

On Friday, a Chicago police spokesperson described the allegations against Smollett as ""shameful.""

""If proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model,"" Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Smollett had been released on bond after first being charged last month. His representative did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment.

A spokesperson for Fox, which airs Empire, also declined to comment Friday afternoon."

Smollett, who stars in the hit show Empire, had originally told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two men while walking down the street, but Smollett is now accused of orchestrating the incident himself and lying to police about what happened.

Smollett, through his lawyers, has vehemently denied the allegation that he staged the attack. In February, Smollet was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report; although the actor has not yet entered a plea for the most recent charges, he pleaded not guilty to the disorderly conduct charge, and was released on $100,000 bail.

Smollett had initially told police that, while walking home on the morning of Jan. 29, two men approached him on the street, assaulted him, wrapped a rope around his neck, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs. He was admitted to a hospital and questioned by police, who soon released surveillance images of two ""people of interest"" in their investigation and, two weeks later, arrested two Nigerian brothers in connection with the case.

However, police soon began to doubt Smollett's story. They released the two brothers without charge, and Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Feb. 17 that ""the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" Smollett's lawyers later said that one of the men arrested was Smollett's personal trainer, but that it is ""impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

Three days later, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about the attack. Two law enforcement sources had told CNN earlier that police suspected that Smollett staged the attack, and Chicago police confirmed that this was their suspicion at a Feb. 21 press conference. Smollett turned himself in the next day.

""This announcement today recognizes that 'Empire' actor Jussie Smolett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson told reporters. ""I'm left hanging my head and asking why.""

Smollet, through his lawyers, vowed to fight the charges.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's legal team said in a statement after the initial charges were announced. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

When Smollett made his initial claims, he received an outpouring of support from celebrities, fans, and activists. The revelation that he may have staged his attack disheartened many of his supporters, who feared that the story might lead people to doubt future, legitimate reports of hate crimes. Some pointed out that hate crimes against black people have been on the rise for three years straight, according to the FBI, while others stressed that, according to a study published in The Color of Crime, the majority of racial hoaxes involve white people falsely claiming to have been victimized by black people, not the other way around.

According to ABC 7, experts believe that Smollett will take a plea deal and potentially not serve any prison time."

By Suzannah Gonzales

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive,"" adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett's claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of ""Empire"" but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, ""to distract from the internal investigation.""

""Empire"" debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season.

A Chicago grand jury has hit Jussie Smollett with an additional 15 counts of filing a false police report.

The Empire actor was initially charged with one Class 4 Felony charge of disorderly conduct last month, but a grand jury applied that charge 15 more times in an 86-page indictment that was returned Thursday (Mar. 7).

Each new charge doesn’t pose any additional prison time but carries a maximum probation sentence of four years. Smollett now faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison or probation and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett claimed on January 29th that he was assaulted by two masked men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him. The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, also said his attackers poured a chemical substance he believed was bleach and also put a noose around his neck.

CWB Chicago reports that the grand jury’s indictment states that Smollett lied about the attack to two separate police officers—the beat cop who took his initial report and a detective who conducted a follow-up interview that same day.

According to CWB Chicago:

In one set of charges, the grand jury found that Smollet filed a false police report around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29th in which he told an officer that he was attacked near 341 East Lower North Water Street by two unknown men who were dressed in black and one of whom wore a ski mask. The jury further found that Smollett told the original officer that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs and struck him in the face with their hands. The police report connected to these charges also indicate that Smollett claimed that a noose had been placed around his neck and a “chemical” had been poured on him. The second set of charges returned by the grand jury involves Smollett’s alleged false reporting of the incident to a police detective later the same day. Additional details that Smollett apparently included in the second interview include: the men approached him from behind, Smollett fought back, and all three men fell to the ground where Smollett said he was kicked in the back and felt someone pulling on his neck. During this interview, Smollett also told the officer that one offender was a white male wearing a black mask with an open area around the eyes that exposed the attacker’s skin, the grand jury found. While announcing the initial charge against Smollett last month, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said his department believed that Smollett was also responsible for mailing a threat letter to himself that set the stage for the purported hate crime. Nonetheless, no charges were brought against Smollett in connection with the letter by the grand jury. The new charges against Smollett each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years if convicted. Realistically, though, Smollett is unlikely to be convicted on more than a fraction of the charges. Most Cook County criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains in which a defendant pleads guilty to one and, rarely, two counts of an indictment in return for a favorable sentence. Only by going to trial do most defendants run the real risk of being convicted of more than one or two counts.

Smollett is accused of hiring brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to help him stage the attack.

The brothers told police the actor paid them $3,500 and promised them an additional $500 which they would get when they returned home from a trip to Nigeria. They said Smollett’s motive was that he wanted a higher salary on Empire.

Before he was arrested, the actor went on Good Morning America, where he cried and insisted he was telling the truth amid public cynicism.

Fox has said it’s “considering its options” in light of Smollett’s arrest. He won’t appear in the final two episodes of Empire that are scheduled to air later this year.

Smollett’s attorneys are due back in court next week.

The actor and his legal team have denied the allegations against him and say that he’s been the victim of police and prosecutorial misconduct.

Smollett’s lawyers said his presumption of innocence was “trampled” and the entire investigation into the attack has been flawed from the beginning."

Smollett was originally charged with filing a false police report after the Jan. 29 incident when he claimed two masked men attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

The grand jury returned two different sets of charges, according to a report published by ABC7.

The first charges are related to what Smollett told officers about the attack that he allegedly fabricated. The second round of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police. Smollett could be facing probation or up to four years in prison for each individual charge.

Experts conclude that Smollett will most likely take a plea deal and spend no time in prison wrote ABC7. (RELATED: Queen Latifah Backs Jussie Smollett After Alleged Hate Crime Hoax)

As previously reported, Smollett pleaded “not guilty” to the first charge of disorderly conduct and was released on $100,000 bond.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett originally faked a death threat letter and when that didn’t gain enough attention he paid the Osundairo brother’s $3,500 to stage the alleged hate crime.

The Osundairo brothers have since publicly expressed regret for their involvement with the alleged attack.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the brothers’ attorney told CNN."

An Illinois grand jury has indicted Empire actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony charges related the alleged hate attack he reported on Jan. 29.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed with ABC7 that the 16-count indictment was returned by the grand jury on Thursday.

On Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He now faces 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in two separate sets of charges—one set related to what he initially told police and the second set related to what he told police in a follow-up interview later the same day.

Each of the 16 charges carries with it a possible sentence of probation to four years in prison.

According to ABC7, experts predict Smollett—who turned himself in and pleaded not guilty to the original charge before posting $100,000 bond—will strike a plea deal to avoid spending time in prison.

Smollett told police that he was attacked near his Chicago apartment around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He said the attackers called him racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him, put a noose around his neck and poured a chemical substance he believed to be bleach on him.

Smollett also said his attackers told him “This is MAGA country,” referring to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”—a catchphrase that has since become associated with racism and hate.

Chicago police said they had two persons of interest that they were looking to speak with two days after the attack. Those persons were later identified as Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, two brothers Smollett knows.

The brothers cooperated with police, and that is when the investigation turned on Smollett and he became a suspect in the crime against him. Police allege Smollett staged the attack with help from the Osundairo brothers, and that he paid them $3, 500 to carry out the fake attack.

Smollett’s character has since been removed from the final two episodes of this season of Empire.

The FBI is currently looking into a threatening letter containing white powder that Smollett received on the set of Empire. There is no proof that Smollett sent the letter to himself, but if it is later shown that he did, he could face federal charges as well."

Jussie Smollett is now facing an additional 15 felony counts of filing a false police report from a grand jury.

The 36-year-old Empire actor was originally charged with one Class 4 Felony charge for disorderly conduct for filing a false report, after claiming two men attacked him last month in a hate crime.

In an 86-page indictment (via CWB Chicago), that charge has now been applied 15 times over by Cook County grand jury, meaning he now faces 16 felony counts.

While each charge doesn’t potentially mean additional time in prison, but each charge carries a maximum probation sentence of four years. He’s now potentially facing a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation.

The 15 new charges are divided between two areas, with the first applying to his initial report to Chicago Police Department. The other charges are for Jussie’s second interview with police.

Jussie was attacked by two masked men in Chicago, with reports stating his attackers had ‘beaten him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him’.

The actor received treatment following the attack and had reported the incident to Chicago Police, with the authorities treating it as a ‘hate crime’ after his attackers allegedly hurled racist and homophobic slurs at Jussie throughout.

After the two men arrested over the attack were released, Jussie was arrested and faced a charge of disorderly conduct – with that now being boosted with 15 additional counts.

Jussie has denied all the allegations against him and is set to appear in court on 16 March.

The second set of charges is related to the second interview Smollett did with cops about the alleged attack later that day.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two men near his Chicago apartment on Jan. 29. The alleged assailants yelled “This is MAGA country” during the incident.

The brothers claimed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to help stage the “hate crime” after he became upset that a letter threatening him did not get enough attention.

The various charges include 2 sets, one for Smollett’s initial report and the other for the follow up interview with cops.

UPDATE! 6:21 P.M. PST: According to TMZ, following the indictment, Jussie Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, released the following statement:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie… This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Additionally, the publication said it appears the grand jury slapped the actor with one count for EACH allegedly false statement he made during his two interviews with authorities.

———-

Whoa! With all the evidence we’ve been hearing, the clock has been ticking on Jussie Smollett being charged with a crime.

Now the hammer has finally come down, and it’s come down HARD.

The Cook County grand jury has chosen to indict Jussie on 16 counts (!!!) for “false report of offense” — all class 4 felonies.

Related: Robin Roberts Says She Didn’t Want To Interview Jussie Because Of ‘Red Flags’

Apparently the multiple charges stem from Jussie’s allegedly false statements to police on more than one occasion, with each instance being viewed as its own crime.

If found guilty, the Empire star could be heading to prison for YEARS.

A class 4 felony can get one anywhere from 1-3 years in prison, so if Jussie was convicted on every count and the book was thrown at him he could technically get 48 years.

(That’s years, not months. We mean, he’s not Paul Manafort, who only lied to federal investigators about the most important investigation in U.S. history… *sigh*)

There’s basically no chance of that many consecutive sentences, but that should give you an idea of how serious these charges are.

Jussie first reported at the end of January he’d been the victim of a brutal attack by racist homophobes who recognized him from Empire. He claimed two white men in ski masks beat him and choked him with a noose — but he fought back, and they eventually drove away.

But not before yelling, “This is MAGA country,” at him, referring to Donald Trump‘s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, which started out having racist implications and has only gotten more synonymous as white supremacists have embraced the President and his red hats.

Jussie told police — and press outlets — he walked all the way to the hospital with the noose around his neck the whole time.

Many expressed doubt about the story at the time, but then again a certain number of people come out and scream hoax every time there’s a school shooting.

But the singer found himself in legal jeopardy shortly thereafter when police tracked down two persons of interest — who turned out to be not two white men but actually a pair of Nigerian brothers. Not only that, one had been an extra on Empire; they knew Jussie.

Apparently the two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, cooperated with police from jump street — and told them Jussie paid them to stage the attack.

Subsequently surveillance video showed them purchasing ski masks, rope, and other paraphernalia used in the attack.

They even produced a $3500 check Jussie wrote them for “training” but it’s unconfirmed if that was really payment for the attack.

Related: Cohen Implicates Trump In Crimes

Police even reportedly believe the hate mail Jussie showed Empire producers before the attack was fabricated.

As much as these charges sound a little excessive, it’s difficult to feel bad for Jussie if he really created such a dangerous hoax.

Was it really all for the attention? Hurting so many real victims who are going to find it harder to be believed??

Of course, this should do the opposite — after all, as we keep saying…

It is impossible to pull off a hoax these days!

As difficult as it may have been in the past, there’s just too much information and access to evidence available at our fingertips. This case should be further proof the truth will come out.

But that won’t be how it’s taken. It will be used as fuel for those who want to discredit all victims of racism, all victims of homophobia, and anyone who equates MAGA with racism.

So yeah. Hard to feel sorry for this man if he really made all this up.

What do YOU think??

An Illinois grand jury has indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.

Several hours after the grand jury indictments were announced late Friday, Smollett's attorney issued a new statement, ""adamantly"" maintaining the actor's innocence and accusing law enforcement of leaking details of the probe.

Yet proving Smollett's innocence will be a tall order for celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, as the Chicago Police Department that investigated the alleged attack continues to publicly describes Smollett's alleged actions as ""shameful, [and] if proven, an affront to the people of Chicago.""

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.

The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

In a statement released on Twitter Friday evening, Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesman Anthony Guglielmi referred calls to prosecutors about the grand jury indictments.

“As Superintendent [Eddie] Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives…”

Geragos, a Los Angeles-based criminal defense lawyer whose clients have included Chris Brown, Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder, is taking an aggressive approach to Smollett's defense -- calling the 16-count indictment ""prosecutorial overkill"" and a ""desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal [CPD] investigation launched to investigate the ... leaking of false information"" about the Smollett probe.

Geragos also launched a broadside at employees of the hospital where Smollett was treated after the alleged incident for the ""shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

Earlier this week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the CPD had begun such an internal investigation into the leaks.

Meanwhile, dozens of employees at Northwestern Hospital where Smollett was treated after the alleged incident have been fired for improperly accessing the actor's medical records, according to CBS Chicago affiliate WBBM.

Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was ordered to surrender his passport and taken into custody, after which he posted $100,000 bond to be freed.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him. The alleged assailants yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan, Smollett told police.

Police identified and questioned two ""persons of interest"" captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a threatening letter addressed to him and delivered on Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where ""Empire"" is filmed did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

On Friday, Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County grand jury, with each charge potentially carrying up to four years in prison. Sources at ABC Eyewitness News have suggested the disgraced Empire star will likely avoid jail time with a plea deal, despite his initial “not guilty” plea after turning himself in.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” Geragos told TMZ. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

Geragos was referring to the records at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Smollett was treated following the attack, and where dozens of employees were let go for allegedly accessing his medical records without permission.

TMZ reports that Smollett was “getting hit up nonstop for movies, TV gigs, commercials . . interviews and appearances” after the alleged attack, but is now “being treated like a pariah” by the industry.

Police allege Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on January 29 in downtown Chicago.

ABC News in America reports there are two new sets of charges.

The first relate to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack involving two Nigerian brothers who were allegedly paid $US3,500 to attack him.

Smollett first told police the alleged attackers yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

The next set of charges are linked to a second police interview Smollett had about the alleged attack.

The new charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years.

Smollett was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police. The disgraced actor handed himself into police.

He has already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge.

He surrendered his passport and was taken into custody and later paid $US100,000 to get bail.

The two alleged attackers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on February 13 but later released without charge.

Police have said they are no longer considered suspects.

The new charges against Smollett come as Chicago police said they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into Smollett’s claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month.

Guglielmi said no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case."

‘Empire’ Actor Jussie Smollett Indicted on 16 Felony Counts by Grand Jury

A Chicago grand jury indicted Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” actor, on 16 counts for allegedly lying to police about what he described to be a hate crime attack, according to reports on March. 8.

In February, he was charged with disorderly conduct and released on $100,000 bail.

In January, the actor claimed to be attacked by two men who yelled pro-President Trump remarks, along with racist language. They also allegedly poured a chemical on him and looped a rope around his neck to simulate a lynching.

Detectives in Chicago later determined that Smollett allegedly set up the attack, which was highly publicized by media outlets, politicians, and celebrities. They said he committed the act to further his career.

ABC7 reported on March 8 the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the grand jury’s indictment of Smollett.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” according to the indictment, reported CBS Chicago.

New charges could each carry a possible probation sentence of up to four years.

Smollett has already pleaded not guilty to the first charge. He and his attorneys have denied having anything to do with staging an assault.

Police allege Smollett of paying both Ola and Abel Osundairo, who are originally from Nigeria, $3,500 in the form of a check to carry out the attack. Police have obtained the original check.

CBS Chicago reported Smollett directed the two men to purchase rope, masks, and a hat at a store in Uptown Chicago.

Police allege the brothers wore gloves during the incident and bruises and scratches on his face were self-inflicted.

Attacked for Trying to Eat

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett told police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory, according to The Associated Press.

On January 30, Chicago police confirmed they had reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown but none actually shows the attack happened. Police obtained and released images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

Reports of an assault on Smollett drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers.

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence.

(This March 8 story has been refiled to correct amount of alleged payment by Smollett to $3,500 instead of $35,000 in paragraph 8)

By Suzannah Gonzales

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as ""redundant and vindictive,"" adding that his client ""adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week's indictment ""because it's the same case,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett's claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor's defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of ""Empire"" but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, ""to distract from the internal investigation.""

""Empire"" debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show's current season."

The “Empire” actor was originally arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report on Feb. 21. Now, according to ABC, “The grand jury has returned 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.” Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment, which was returned by the grand jury on Thursday.

ABC also reports, “The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with his their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.”

As of now, he is not facing jail time, only a possible sentence of probation to four years.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo told them the attack was orchestrated by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

Smollett pled not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge.

UPDATE (3/27/19), 9:30 PM EST: The FBI is now reportedly reviewing “the circumstances” surrounding “the dismissal” of Jussie Smollett’s 16 felony disorderly conduct charges on March 26, which two unnamed law enforcement officials confirmed to ABC7. HollywoodLife has reached out to the FBI for comment.

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: Jussie Smollett, 36, has been hit with 16 felony charges for allegedly filing a false police report when he claimed that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack in January. A Cook County grand jury returned the indictment on March 7, according to ABC 7 Chicago. The charges have been confirmed by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The Empire star had already been charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20 for filing a false police report.

Jussie drew headlines when he claimed that he was attacked by two strangers in his Chicago neighborhood on Jan. 29. He alleged that the two men physically assaulted him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, as well as flinging a chemical substance in his face and putting a noose around his neck. Within a month, after an investigation, Chicago police arrested Jussie alleging that he paid two brothers – Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo – to beat him up. He was released after posting $100,000 bail.

These indictments are reportedly related to two separate sets of charges, according to ABC 7 Chicago – one set for what Jussie told officers about the alleged hate crime and the other set is related to his second interview with cops. HollywoodLife has reached out to the actor’s lawyers, rep and FOX (which airs Empire) for comment, but we have yet to receive a response. As for how much time Jussie faces, Illinois State criminal defense attorney Dustin Smith, tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY, “The sentencing range for prison time is between one and three years. I know there are a lot of charges, but in most situations, charges that stem out of the same conduct are not served in a consecutive sentence. What that means is that Jussie’s 16 charges won’t be multiplied by one to three years. It’s more likely to be a total of one to three years.” He added, “If Jussie received only probation, the period of probation would not exceed 30 months.”

Jussie has repeatedly denied allegations that he orchestrated a fake hate crime. And after the news of the 16 felony charges emerged, Jussie’s lawyer Mark Geragos told HollywoodLife, “The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

HollywoodLife will keep you updated as this story develops."

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence. Two federal officials tell ABC News that the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter before the alleged attack.Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation ""out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" according to the Associated Press. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case.Foxx had acted as an early intermediary between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department, according to a statement released by her office.""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, according to WLS Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the attack against himself in Chicago, police and the state attorney's office confirmed to ABC News.The charge of felony disorderly conduct carries a penalty of one to three years in jail, according to the criminal statute.""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.By Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department had officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department's verified account , represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment continue to stand by the embattled ""Empire"" actor, and continue to deny reports that he was or is being written off the hit show. ""Jussie Smollett continues to a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police to face a felony charge of filing a false report, a crime that, if convicted, could put him in jail for one to three years.In an emotional press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson blasted Smollett on Thursday in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career.""""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said. ""I am left hanging my head asking 'why?'. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?""Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""In a new statement on Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment officials said that ""[w]e understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""The Cook County State Attorney's Office announces that the previous day a grand jury indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack , including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.At an emergency hearing in a Cook County courtroom in Illinois, all criminal charges against Smollett were dropped.""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th,"" his attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement. ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of fake and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that the victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect.""""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""The unanticipated development shocked Chicago, and prompted angry reactions from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who each reiterated their belief that the incident was a hoax -- with Emanuel wondering aloud, ""Is there no decency in this man?""The duo went on to accuse to 'Empire' actor of receiving preferential treatment by the Illinois State Attorney's Office.""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. ""There is no accountability. It is wrong, full stop.""Johnson said he was surprised to learn of the decision to drop charges against Smollett while attending a police academy graduation with Mayor Emanuel.A furious Johnson said prosecutors brokered a deal with Smollett in secrecy.""I'm sure we all know what happened this morning,"" Johnson said at his press conference. ""Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is owed an apology.""""At the end of the day, it's Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax, period,"" Johnson said. ""I heard that they wanted their day in court ... so America could know the truth, and they chose to hide behind a secrecy of a brokered deal to circumvent the judicial system.""Johnson said that he and Emanuel only learned about the charges being dropped when it was announced publicly.""We found about it when you all did,"" Johnson said of the lack of notice from the State's Attorney Office regarding the dropped charges. ""I'm sure we'll have some conversation after this. But again at the end of the day Mr. Smollett committed this hoax.""Emanuel noted that ""a sliver"" of the evidence was presented to a grand jury, which indicted Smollett. He said Smollett used race and privilege to ""get off scott free"" and that the actor has shown no remorse or accountability for his actions.""A person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities, and you turn around and use them to advance your career?"" Emmanuel said. ""Is there no decency in this man?""In a subsequent interview with ABC News Chicago station WLS, the prosecutor who dropped the charges against Smollett told ABC News station WLS that he believes Smollett made a false report about being attacked, but decided to drop the charges anyway.""We stand behind the investigation and the facts revealed,"" said Joe Magats, the first assistant state attorney who took over the case when his boss, State Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the probe after it surfaced that she had been in touch with Smollett's family.In fact, according to text messages obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Foxx reached out to Johnson and asked him to turn the probe over to the FBI -- though the police department ultimately completed the investigation independently.""We believe he did was he was charged with what he was doing."" Asked again whether he believes Smollett fabricated the incident, he replied, ""yes.""""This was not an exoneration. To say that he was exonerated by us or anyone is not true.""In answer to questions about the dropping of the charges, Magats initially suggested that it was a question of resources, and that he decided to drop the charges after determining""Our goal and our #1 priority is combatting violent crime and the drivers of violence and we look to our resources to do that and I don't think that Mr. Smollett is a driver of violence or a violent individual.""Magats also said that he was satisfied with Smollett forfeiting the 10 percent of $100K bond he put up, and completing community service prior to getting the charges dropped.""In return for forfeiting his bond to the City of Chicago and doing his community service, we agreed to dismiss the charges against him. He did community service for Operation Push.""An Illinois judge rules that records sealed in the ""hoax attack"" criminal case of ""Empire"" cast member Jussie Smollett be made public, ruling that the actor has not displayed the ""actions of a person seeking to maintain his privacy.""Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven G. Watkins ordered that investigative files in the high-profile case be unsealed after ABC News and other media organizations argued that keeping them from public view was a violation of the First Amendment and the public's right of access to court records.Cook County Judge Michael Toomin appoints a special prosecutor to investigate the decision to dismiss all charges against Smollett, opening up the possibility that the actor could being charged again, the Associated Press reports.Toomin also suggested that Foxx may have mishandled the case by appointing a top aide to oversee it after she recused herself.Police release nearly 70 hours of video in connection to the Smollett investigation, including body camera footage of the actor with a with noose around his neck. The video footage also includes Smollett asking the officers to turn off their recording devices, while another group of clips shows the moment when the police apprehend the two brothers who allege they helped Smollett stage the attack."

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment on Friday, ABC 7 Chicago reported.

Smollett stands accused of orchestrating a fake hate crime with the help of Ola and Abel Osundairo, siblings who were initially regarded as persons of interest in the attack and have since turned into key witnesses. Class 4 felony disorderly conduct is a crime that could be punished by 1-3 years behind bars in Illinois.

Smollett pleaded not guilty to the first felony charge.

A Chicago grand jury has now tacked on 16 felony disorderly conduct counts. According the the latest reporting, these charges relate not to the initial reporting of the attack but to a follow-up interview Smollett had with police later on the same day. The current thinking is that Smollett might seek a plea to deal to avoid jail time, but, of course, that would require an admission of guilt.

There’s also been some question of whether he could face federal charges for allegedly mailing himself a fake hate letter.

Smollett said that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic assault, that his assailants had a noose, and that they poured a bleach-like substance on him while saying, “This is MAGA country.” This incident, he said, occurred in Chicago after he’d left a Subway restaurant.

Smollett later went on ABC News to be interviewed by Robin Roberts. During that interview, Smollett said he was “pissed” people didn’t believe him.

After the Osundairo brothers were interviewed, police came to a completely different conclusion — namely, that Smollett had paid them by check to stage the attack because he was unhappy with his salary on the show Empire.

Smollett and his attorney Mark Geragos denied this. On his podcast Reasonable Doubt, Geragos asked the kind of questions that you might expect to be asked in a courtroom on cross examination. Remember: Chicago Police initially identified the Osundairos as persons of interest in the attack. Days later, they were no longer considered persons of interest but victims, and were released from custody without being charged. They also provided information that was deemed credible enough for an indictment.

Geragos wanted to know what happened after the witnesses were taken into custody but before they were released, and why.

“Did you charge them? Did you give them immunity? Did you do anything with them?” he said. “You said they changed their story in the 48th hour — why did they change their story? Was it lawyer-driven?”

Geragos claims that, actually, the real case is against the exonerated witnesses.

“I have not seen anything that supports this idea or the narrative that they put out there that he was in cahoots with anyone. They have a whale of a case against the two guys — the two brothers — but that’s it,” he said. If there was a deal involved, you can expect the defense attorneys will argue that this more than taints the witness explanation. Geragos further claimed that the narrative that Smollett was pissed off about his salary was “not true.”

“They didn’t talk to his lawyer, they didn’t talk to anybody at the production company, they didn’t talk to an agent,” Geragos continued. “Nobody. I’ve done that. I know for a fact that’s untrue. That’s categorically untrue. That’s not the motivation, yet that was what was articulated as the motivation.”

The indictment charges Smollett, 36, with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.

Mark Geragos, one of Smollett’s attorneys and a CNN legal analyst, said the actor maintains his innocence and called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,” Geragos said.

He remains out on bail pending an arraignment Thursday.

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

The indictment says Smollett told police he was attacked by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs during an attack at 2 a.m.

After police detained two brothers who were “persons of interest” in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and allegedly had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

Smollett was charged in February with felony disorderly conduct. The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys said in February.

The subsection of the Illinois law states: “A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly … (4) Transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.”

The producers behind “Empire” decided to remove Smollett’s character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of the season. The decision was made to “avoid further disruption on set,” producers said.

A spokesperson for Fox said Friday the company has no comment."

By Suzannah Gonzales

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that leveling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defense cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defense.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologized last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season."

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama ""Empire,"" was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Neither Smollett's attorney nor his spokeswoman could immediately be reached for comment on the latest charges.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett had paid two brothers $35,000 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

Smollett, 36, was arrested and later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury on Thursday, charges Smollett with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct alleging that he gave false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators. A copy of the document was furnished to Reuters by a Cook County Circuit Court clerk.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett's story, he reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

Smollett also told police, according to authorities, that the attackers had yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said.

News of the purported assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

The grand jury returned the indictment on Thursday. The State’s Attorney’s Office originally charged Smollett with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report on Feb. 20.

The indictment arrived as two separate sets of charges. The first set pertains to what Smollett told authorities about the purported attack, including what the two men did and said to him. The second set pertains to the second interview Smollett gave to the police on the day of the attack.

Each set of charges carries a possible sentence of probation to four years. Smollett pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge from Feb. 20. He was then taken into custody and posted the $100,000 bond to be released.

Experts think it's probable that he'll get a plea deal and probably won’t spend any time in jail.

On Jan. 29, the Empire actor alleged that he was the victim of a serious hate crime in Chicago, claiming that two men assaulted him and called him racist and homophobic names. He also said they threw a chemical liquid on him and put a rope around his neck."

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence. Two federal officials tell ABC News that the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter before the alleged attack.Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation ""out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" according to the Associated Press. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case.Foxx had acted as an early intermediary between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department, according to a statement released by her office.""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, according to WLS Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the attack against himself in Chicago, police and the state attorney's office confirmed to ABC News.The charge of felony disorderly conduct carries a penalty of one to three years in jail, according to the criminal statute.""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.By Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department had officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department's verified account , represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment continue to stand by the embattled ""Empire"" actor, and continue to deny reports that he was or is being written off the hit show. ""Jussie Smollett continues to a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police to face a felony charge of filing a false report, a crime that, if convicted, could put him in jail for one to three years.In an emotional press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson blasted Smollett on Thursday in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career.""""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said. ""I am left hanging my head asking 'why?'. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?""Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""In a new statement on Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment officials said that ""[w]e understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""The Cook County State Attorney's Office announces that the previous day a grand jury indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack , including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.At an emergency hearing in a Cook County courtroom in Illinois, all criminal charges against Smollett were dropped.""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th,"" his attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement. ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of fake and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that the victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect.""""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""The unanticipated development shocked Chicago, and prompted angry reactions from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who each reiterated their belief that the incident was a hoax -- with Emanuel wondering aloud, ""Is there no decency in this man?""The duo went on to accuse to 'Empire' actor of receiving preferential treatment by the Illinois State Attorney's Office.""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. ""There is no accountability. It is wrong, full stop.""Johnson said he was surprised to learn of the decision to drop charges against Smollett while attending a police academy graduation with Mayor Emanuel.A furious Johnson said prosecutors brokered a deal with Smollett in secrecy.""I'm sure we all know what happened this morning,"" Johnson said at his press conference. ""Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is owed an apology.""""At the end of the day, it's Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax, period,"" Johnson said. ""I heard that they wanted their day in court ... so America could know the truth, and they chose to hide behind a secrecy of a brokered deal to circumvent the judicial system.""Johnson said that he and Emanuel only learned about the charges being dropped when it was announced publicly.""We found about it when you all did,"" Johnson said of the lack of notice from the State's Attorney Office regarding the dropped charges. ""I'm sure we'll have some conversation after this. But again at the end of the day Mr. Smollett committed this hoax.""Emanuel noted that ""a sliver"" of the evidence was presented to a grand jury, which indicted Smollett. He said Smollett used race and privilege to ""get off scott free"" and that the actor has shown no remorse or accountability for his actions.""A person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities, and you turn around and use them to advance your career?"" Emmanuel said. ""Is there no decency in this man?""In a subsequent interview with ABC News Chicago station WLS, the prosecutor who dropped the charges against Smollett told ABC News station WLS that he believes Smollett made a false report about being attacked, but decided to drop the charges anyway.""We stand behind the investigation and the facts revealed,"" said Joe Magats, the first assistant state attorney who took over the case when his boss, State Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the probe after it surfaced that she had been in touch with Smollett's family.In fact, according to text messages obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Foxx reached out to Johnson and asked him to turn the probe over to the FBI -- though the police department ultimately completed the investigation independently.""We believe he did was he was charged with what he was doing."" Asked again whether he believes Smollett fabricated the incident, he replied, ""yes.""""This was not an exoneration. To say that he was exonerated by us or anyone is not true.""In answer to questions about the dropping of the charges, Magats initially suggested that it was a question of resources, and that he decided to drop the charges after determining""Our goal and our #1 priority is combatting violent crime and the drivers of violence and we look to our resources to do that and I don't think that Mr. Smollett is a driver of violence or a violent individual.""Magats also said that he was satisfied with Smollett forfeiting the 10 percent of $100K bond he put up, and completing community service prior to getting the charges dropped.""In return for forfeiting his bond to the City of Chicago and doing his community service, we agreed to dismiss the charges against him. He did community service for Operation Push.""An Illinois judge rules that records sealed in the ""hoax attack"" criminal case of ""Empire"" cast member Jussie Smollett be made public, ruling that the actor has not displayed the ""actions of a person seeking to maintain his privacy.""Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven G. Watkins ordered that investigative files in the high-profile case be unsealed after ABC News and other media organizations argued that keeping them from public view was a violation of the First Amendment and the public's right of access to court records.Cook County Judge Michael Toomin appoints a special prosecutor to investigate the decision to dismiss all charges against Smollett, opening up the possibility that the actor could being charged again, the Associated Press reports.Toomin also suggested that Foxx may have mishandled the case by appointing a top aide to oversee it after she recused herself.Police release nearly 70 hours of video in connection to the Smollett investigation, including body camera footage of the actor with a with noose around his neck. The video footage also includes Smollett asking the officers to turn off their recording devices, while another group of clips shows the moment when the police apprehend the two brothers who allege they helped Smollett stage the attack."

The actor, 36, who is black and gay, also said his attackers poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck. Authorities then began to investigate the case a potential hate crime.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News at the time of his arrest in late February that the investigation into the alleged attack demanded ""considerable"" police resources. He said that at one point the department had 12 detectives scouring surveillance videos.

Some social media users began to cast doubt on Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

Police also had said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records for the investigation. The actor had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

Police have said, however, that Smollett was cooperating with the investigation, and later gave investigators a PDF file with partial phone records.

Guglielmi said on Feb. 16 that the investigation shifted after questioning two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were potential persons of interest in the case.

Just days later, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for the alleged false report.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said after Smollett’s arrest that the actor “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Johnson claimed that Smollett was unhappy with his salary on Fox’s “Empire” and Smollett sent himself a letter containing racist language, and when that did not work, he paid $3,500 to orchestrate the attack.

The top prosecutor in the Chicago area, Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx, recused herself from the case in February because she had had ""conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department,"" a spokesperson for the office said.

5:30 PM PT -- Jussie's attorney, Mark Geragos, just released a scathing response to the indictment, telling us, ""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.""

Geragos continues, ""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

2:45 PM PT -- We've now read the indictment, and it appears the grand jury hit Jussie with one count for EACH allegedly false statement he made during the 2 interviews with cops.

Jussie Smollett just got slammed by a Cook County grand jury, which has returned a 16-count felony indictment against him for filing a false police report.

Smollett was originally charged by the State Attorney's Office with a felony of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. The new indictments obviously take the case to another level.

As for why there are so many counts ... the grand jury reportedly handed up 2 sets of charges -- one for Smollett's initial report to Chicago PD, and the other charges are for Jussie's second interview with cops.

We're told Ola and Abel Osundairo told grand jurors Jussie hired them to stage the so-called ""attack."" The brothers were caught on camera buying a bunch of supplies before the incident ... including ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats.

Play video content TMZ.com

Chicago PD has come out strong against Jussie ... making it clear they had a lot of issues with his version of events -- including the fact he took them to the scene and immediately pointed to a camera which he said captured the incident. Turns out, the camera was pointed in the wrong direction.

Abel and Ola told police they drove with Jussie in the days prior to the incident scouting a location and even rehearsed the ""attack.""

As for the hate mail sent to Jussie at Fox Studios in Chicago ... police say they believe the ""Empire"" star is behind that too. However, we know the FBI hadn't confirmed that when Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasted Jussie in his news conference.

We also know the brothers told police they had nothing to do with the letter, and only saw it in a photo on Jussie's phone."

The actor/singer was charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, with the indictment stemming from that initial charge.

Two separate sets of charges were handed down by the grand jury. The first set of charges related to the specifics of the story Smollett initially told police about the attack. The second set of charges are related to the follow-up interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that same day.

The new set of charges carry a sentencing range of probabation to four years in prison, though most prosecution and defense experts have said since his arrest that Smollett will most likely cut a plea deal and avoid prison time.

In late January 2019, Smollett alleged that he had been physically assaulted in Chicago, a victime of what was thought of as a ""hate crime"" by Chicago Police at the time. He claimed that the two men who attacked him also yelled racist and homophobic slurs, while placing a rope around Smollett's neck and throwing a liquid substance on him.

Originally picked up by Chicago PD on February 13 and questioned for 48 hours as ""persons of interest"" in the alleged attack, siblings Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo ended up cooperating with law enforcement. Both brothers have been extras on the FOX series in the past, and a personal trainer to Smollett.

Shortly after the ""assault,"" ABC's Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett where the actor/singer went into detail about the assualt and what life has been like for him since that time. Speaking with interviewer / GMA co-host Robin Roberts, Smollett had this to say when asked about allegation being made that the attack was a hoax:

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

Portraying the character of Jamal Lyon on FOX's long-running and popular prime-time drama Empire since its premiere, the award-winning actor/singer was in Chicago the weekend of the alleged attack to prepare for a concert he was set to perform.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and openly gay, plays Jamal Lyon on Fox's hit TV show, ""Empire,"" a drama that chronicles a family-run record label. He told police he was attacked by two masked men when he was returning home from a Subway sandwich store Jan. 29 around 2 a.m.

Smollett claimed the two men had beat him, said homophobic and racial slurs and put a noose around his neck before fleeing. He said he heard, ""this is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan.

Police arrested two brothers who they initially linked to the alleged attack. But police said the brothers then said Smollett had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Police said they told them the rope that was found around Smollett's neck was purchased at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.

Police said the two brothers wore gloves during the staged attack and did punch Smollett, but the scratches and bruises on Smollett's face most likely were self-inflicted, CBS Chicago reported.

Sources told CBS Chicago that Smollett was angry that he did not receive a ""bigger response"" from a threatening letter sent to ""Empire."" The letter, later published by TMZ, contained a homophobic death threat against Smollett spelled out in cut-up letters. The envelope reads ""MAGA,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But police later alleged Smollett sent that letter. Smollett turned himself in on Feb. 21 and was released hours later after posting $10,000 bond.

On Feb. 22, the television show ""Empire"" said Smollett would be written out of the last two episodes of the season, which still had yet to be filmed. On Friday, 20th Century Fox said the studio and the network had no comment.

By Suzannah Gonzales

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Television actor Jussie Smollett, arrested last month on a single charge of perpetrating a hate-crime hoax, has been newly indicted on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police that he was assaulted by two strangers shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

The indictment, returned by a Cook County grand jury on Thursday and made public on Friday, greatly expands on the legal jeopardy faced by Smollett, whose story of being attacked in Chicago by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn suspicion since it first surfaced in late January.

Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay musician on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was charged last month in a single-count criminal complaint with making a false report to police, defined under Illinois law as a form of disorderly conduct.

The new indictment in the case contains 16 similar counts: eight related to his interview with one police officer on the day of the purported attack and eight more stemming from his interview with another officer the same day.

Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $25,000 (£18,995) fine.

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, blasted the indictment in a statement as “redundant and vindictive,” adding that his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

He also said that levelling charges in an indictment spares prosecutors the need to submit evidence and witnesses to defence cross-examination in a preliminary hearing, where a judge decides if sufficient cause exists for the case to proceed to trial.

At the time he was initially charged two weeks ago, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an assault on him in a hoax orchestrated to somehow further his acting career.

NO FURTHER ARREST

Smollett has remained free on $100,000 bond since his release hours after surrendering to authorities on Feb. 21. He already was scheduled to return to court on March 14. In the meantime, there is no warrant for his arrest in connection with this week’s indictment “because it’s the same case,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters.

No mention is made in the indictment of Smollett’s claim, according to police, that his attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, as they accosted him.

But the 16-page document includes other elements of the account that Smollett had stood by for weeks.

According to previous police recitations of Smollett’s story, he reported that two masked men approached him on the street in the early hours of Jan. 29 shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

News of the assault spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others wondered whether the story was fabricated even as Chicago police insisted their detectives were treating the matter seriously.

In an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” days before he was charged, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

His attorneys said after his arrest on Feb. 21 they were conducting a thorough investigation for purposes of mounting the actor’s defence.

Smollett himself, according to reports in media citing unnamed sources, apologised last month to the cast and crew on the set of “Empire” but maintained his innocence.

The release of the indictment came after the Chicago Police Department said it started an internal investigation into how information about the alleged hate crime against Smollett was anonymously leaked to reporters.

Geragos said the indictment was designed, in part, “to distract from the internal investigation.”

“Empire” debuted on Fox in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the drama. Producers said in February they were removing his character from the final two episodes of the show’s current season."

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence. Two federal officials tell ABC News that the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter before the alleged attack.Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation ""out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" according to the Associated Press. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case.Foxx had acted as an early intermediary between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department, according to a statement released by her office.""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, according to WLS Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the attack against himself in Chicago, police and the state attorney's office confirmed to ABC News.The charge of felony disorderly conduct carries a penalty of one to three years in jail, according to the criminal statute.""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.By Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department had officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department's verified account , represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment continue to stand by the embattled ""Empire"" actor, and continue to deny reports that he was or is being written off the hit show. ""Jussie Smollett continues to a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police to face a felony charge of filing a false report, a crime that, if convicted, could put him in jail for one to three years.In an emotional press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson blasted Smollett on Thursday in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career.""""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said. ""I am left hanging my head asking 'why?'. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?""Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""In a new statement on Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment officials said that ""[w]e understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""The Cook County State Attorney's Office announces that the previous day a grand jury indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack , including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.At an emergency hearing in a Cook County courtroom in Illinois, all criminal charges against Smollett were dropped.""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th,"" his attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement. ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of fake and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that the victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect.""""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""The unanticipated development shocked Chicago, and prompted angry reactions from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who each reiterated their belief that the incident was a hoax -- with Emanuel wondering aloud, ""Is there no decency in this man?""The duo went on to accuse to 'Empire' actor of receiving preferential treatment by the Illinois State Attorney's Office.""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. ""There is no accountability. It is wrong, full stop.""Johnson said he was surprised to learn of the decision to drop charges against Smollett while attending a police academy graduation with Mayor Emanuel.A furious Johnson said prosecutors brokered a deal with Smollett in secrecy.""I'm sure we all know what happened this morning,"" Johnson said at his press conference. ""Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is owed an apology.""""At the end of the day, it's Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax, period,"" Johnson said.

Smollett had previously been charged with a single count of filing a false police report, which carries the possibility of up to three years in prison.

A Cook County grand jury returned a more thorough indictment on Friday. Eight of the charges involve false statements given to Officer Muhammed Baig, while the other eight pertain to a more detailed account given to Det. Kim Murray.

Smollett told the police that he was assaulted at 2 a.m. by two men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs and put a noose around his neck. In the more detailed account, he claimed that he fought back, and that one of the attackers was white, according to prosecutors.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such an offense had been committed,” the indictment states.

The new counts likely will not have much effect on Smollett’s ultimate sentence, should he be convicted, said Andrew Weisberg, a former Cook County prosecutor now in private practice. The charges would run concurrently, so the sentencing range would still be one to three years in prison. However, most defendants in Smollett’s situation are sentenced to probation.

“I would still expect a period of probation, a psychological evaluation and restitution to cover costs of the investigation,” Weisberg told Variety. “I would still be surprised if he goes to prison.”

Police have alleged that Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack. In a statement last month, officials said they had traced the two attackers using taxi and rideshare records, phone records, and surveillance cameras. They identified the men as Abel and Ola Osundairo, both of whom had worked on “Empire.” The two brothers were arrested at Chicago O’Hare Airport and ultimately agreed to cooperate and testify to the grand jury.

Smollett denies the allegations. He has been written off of the last two episodes of this season of “Empire.”

Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, called the charges “overkill” on Friday, and blasted the department for leaking information about the case to the media.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” Geragos said. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”"

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury in Chicago for allegedly staging a phony racist and homophobic attack against himself, sources said Friday.

The 36-year-old actor was hit Thursday with disorderly-conduct charges for allegedly filing a false police report and lying to cops, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office.

Smollett, who is black and gay, was originally charged with just one felony count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20 after claiming that he was attacked in late January by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him and put his neck in a noose.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time . . . there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment states, according to CBS Chicago.

Smollett is accused of recruiting two men to orchestrate the attack because he was upset with his pay on the TV show, police have said.

The indictment, which expands the criminal case against the actor, centers on allegedly false statements he gave to two Chicago cops. It includes two separate sets of charges — one per officer.

The first set of charges relates to the claims Smollett made in his police report. The second pertains to a follow-up interview that he had later in the day.

Each of the 16 counts carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, but experts expect Smollett to cut a deal — which would allow him to walk free, ­according to WLS-TV.

Smollett’s publicist blasted the number of counts brought against the actor on Friday — calling it “prosecutorial overkill.”

“This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines,” said Smollett’s legal rep, Mark Geragos. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Geragos claimed the charges were an attempt to “distract from the internal investigation launched” into the Chicago Police Department leaking information about the case to the press.

Smollett is allegedly attacked at 2 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago. Two masked assailants poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.Chicago police announce in a tweet that they are seeking two ""persons of interest"" who were captured on surveillance video near the scene and around the time of the alleged attack. Smollett's family releases and emotional statement describing the alleged attack as a hate crime. ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,"" the family wrote in the statement to ABC News . ""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.""Smollett releases a new statement thanking his fans and reiterating that his account of the alleged attack has remained consistent . ""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in the statement . ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.""Smollett makes his first appearance on stage since the alleged attack, performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love,"" Smollett said, tearing up before beginning his set. ""We hope that you all stand with us.""Chicago police release the initial incident report about the alleged attack on Smollett. The report reveals that Smollett was apparently reluctant to report the attack, and that when police arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The report states that a 60-year-old friend of Smollett called the police on his behalf and said the actor ""did not want to report offense however he believed it to be in the best interest to.""Smollett said the attack happened at around 2 a.m. as he was leaving a Subway restaurant. He told police that two attackers gained his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him ""about the face with their hands,"" the report said. ""The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,"" according to the report. ""The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,"" it added.Ten days passed without any developments in the investigation into the alleged attack, prompting growing skepticism about Smollett's account on social media.Unbeknownst to the public, Chicago police investigators had been tracking the two ""persons of interest"" and were aware of who they were ""for awhile,"" a law enforcement source subsequently told ABC News. Investigators learned that these two men were returning to Chicago on Feb. 13 from Nigeria and moved in. The pair were detained at the airport, placed under arrest and taken in for questioning.In an exclusive interview with ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned the details of his story. He defended himself against skeptics who pointed out that it wasn't until a follow-up interview with the police that he mentioned that the assailants yelled ""MAGA Country!"" at him. He also complained about erroneous reports that he had told police that the attackers were actually wearing red MAGA hats.""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f----, they called me a n----. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence. Two federal officials tell ABC News that the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter before the alleged attack.Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation ""out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" according to the Associated Press. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case.Foxx had acted as an early intermediary between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department, according to a statement released by her office.""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, according to WLS Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the attack against himself in Chicago, police and the state attorney's office confirmed to ABC News.The charge of felony disorderly conduct carries a penalty of one to three years in jail, according to the criminal statute.""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.By Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department had officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department's verified account , represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment continue to stand by the embattled ""Empire"" actor, and continue to deny reports that he was or is being written off the hit show. ""Jussie Smollett continues to a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police to face a felony charge of filing a false report, a crime that, if convicted, could put him in jail for one to three years.In an emotional press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson blasted Smollett on Thursday in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career.""""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said. ""I am left hanging my head asking 'why?'. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?""Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""In a new statement on Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment officials said that ""[w]e understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""The Cook County State Attorney's Office announces that the previous day a grand jury indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack , including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.At an emergency hearing in a Cook County courtroom in Illinois, all criminal charges against Smollett were dropped.""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th,"" his attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement. ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of fake and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that the victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect.""""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""The unanticipated development shocked Chicago, and prompted angry reactions from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who each reiterated their belief that the incident was a hoax -- with Emanuel wondering aloud, ""Is there no decency in this man?""The duo went on to accuse to 'Empire' actor of receiving preferential treatment by the Illinois State Attorney's Office.""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. ""There is no accountability. It is wrong, full stop.""Johnson said he was surprised to learn of the decision to drop charges against Smollett while attending a police academy graduation with Mayor Emanuel.A furious Johnson said prosecutors brokered a deal with Smollett in secrecy.""I'm sure we all know what happened this morning,"" Johnson said at his press conference. ""Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is owed an apology.""""At the end of the day, it's Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax, period,"" Johnson said. ""I heard that they wanted their day in court ... so America could know the truth, and they chose to hide behind a secrecy of a brokered deal to circumvent the judicial system.""Johnson said that he and Emanuel only learned about the charges being dropped when it was announced publicly.""We found about it when you all did,"" Johnson said of the lack of notice from the State's Attorney Office regarding the dropped charges. ""I'm sure we'll have some conversation after this. But again at the end of the day Mr. Smollett committed this hoax.""Emanuel noted that ""a sliver"" of the evidence was presented to a grand jury, which indicted Smollett. He said Smollett used race and privilege to ""get off scott free"" and that the actor has shown no remorse or accountability for his actions.""A person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities, and you turn around and use them to advance your career?"" Emmanuel said. ""Is there no decency in this man?""In a subsequent interview with ABC News Chicago station WLS, the prosecutor who dropped the charges against Smollett told ABC News station WLS that he believes Smollett made a false report about being attacked, but decided to drop the charges anyway.""We stand behind the investigation and the facts revealed,"" said Joe Magats, the first assistant state attorney who took over the case when his boss, State Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the probe after it surfaced that she had been in touch with Smollett's family.In fact, according to text messages obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Foxx reached out to Johnson and asked him to turn the probe over to the FBI -- though the police department ultimately completed the investigation independently.""We believe he did was he was charged with what he was doing.""

I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""In the ABC News interview, Smollett also confirmed reports that he was initially reluctant to contact the police or handover his cellphone to help with the investigation.""They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that,"" the singer said. ""Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my cast mate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.""The same day the interview aired, Smollett is re-interviewed by Chicago police investigators. By evening, police sources confirmed that they obtained search warrants and raided the homes of the two individuals, recovering bleach, shoes, electronics and other items.Chicago police announce that they have identified and are questioning the two ""persons of interest"" captured on a surveillance video.By midday, a CPD spokesman tells ABC News that the two 'persons of interest' are, in fact, under arrest, and acknowledge that the pair has ""a relationship with"" Smollett. In an unusual move for an ongoing investigation, police officials who had originally described the two as 'persons of interest' begin describing them as ""potential suspects."" But by late that evening, investigators changed course and announced that the two men have been released without charges Chicago police identify the two men they arrested and later released as brothers -- Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo -- both U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.Later in the day, police said they were ""eager to speak to Jussie Smollett"" based on the new information they obtained after the interrogations. Police contacted the actor's attorneys and said their ""intentions are clear.""Yet in a late-night statement from his attorneys on Saturday, Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" began a statement from Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""The Osundairo brothers, who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago, told authorities that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime , sources told ABC News last month.The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope -- allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs -- at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged Chicago street attack on Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the ""Empire"" show's studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for Smollett said the actor's attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.""We are not racist,"" Osundairo brothers said in a statement. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""Chicago police say they are following up on a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip as not credible based on video evidence. Two federal officials tell ABC News that the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter before the alleged attack.Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation ""out of an abundance of caution ... to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" according to the Associated Press. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case.Foxx had acted as an early intermediary between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department, according to a statement released by her office.""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, according to WLS Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report after allegedly staging the attack against himself in Chicago, police and the state attorney's office confirmed to ABC News.The charge of felony disorderly conduct carries a penalty of one to three years in jail, according to the criminal statute.""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.By Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department had officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department's verified account , represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment continue to stand by the embattled ""Empire"" actor, and continue to deny reports that he was or is being written off the hit show. ""Jussie Smollett continues to a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police to face a felony charge of filing a false report, a crime that, if convicted, could put him in jail for one to three years.In an emotional press conference, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson blasted Smollett on Thursday in which he said that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a ""publicity stunt...to promote his career.""""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said. ""I am left hanging my head asking 'why?'. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? ... How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?""Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""In a new statement on Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment officials said that ""[w]e understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""The Cook County State Attorney's Office announces that the previous day a grand jury indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office told ABC News.The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack , including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.At an emergency hearing in a Cook County courtroom in Illinois, all criminal charges against Smollett were dropped.""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th,"" his attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement. ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of fake and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that the victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect.""""Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.""The unanticipated development shocked Chicago, and prompted angry reactions from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who each reiterated their belief that the incident was a hoax -- with Emanuel wondering aloud, ""Is there no decency in this man?""The duo went on to accuse to 'Empire' actor of receiving preferential treatment by the Illinois State Attorney's Office.""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. ""There is no accountability. It is wrong, full stop.""Johnson said he was surprised to learn of the decision to drop charges against Smollett while attending a police academy graduation with Mayor Emanuel.A furious Johnson said prosecutors brokered a deal with Smollett in secrecy.""I'm sure we all know what happened this morning,"" Johnson said at his press conference. ""Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is owed an apology.""""At the end of the day, it's Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax, period,"" Johnson said. ""I heard that they wanted their day in court ... so America could know the truth, and they chose to hide behind a secrecy of a brokered deal to circumvent the judicial system.""Johnson said that he and Emanuel only learned about the charges being dropped when it was announced publicly.""We found about it when you all did,"" Johnson said of the lack of notice from the State's Attorney Office regarding the dropped charges. ""I'm sure we'll have some conversation after this. But again at the end of the day Mr. Smollett committed this hoax.""Emanuel noted that ""a sliver"" of the evidence was presented to a grand jury, which indicted Smollett. He said Smollett used race and privilege to ""get off scott free"" and that the actor has shown no remorse or accountability for his actions.""A person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities, and you turn around and use them to advance your career?"" Emmanuel said. ""Is there no decency in this man?""In a subsequent interview with ABC News Chicago station WLS, the prosecutor who dropped the charges against Smollett told ABC News station WLS that he believes Smollett made a false report about being attacked, but decided to drop the charges anyway.""We stand behind the investigation and the facts revealed,"" said Joe Magats, the first assistant state attorney who took over the case when his boss, State Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the probe after it surfaced that she had been in touch with Smollett's family.In fact, according to text messages obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Foxx reached out to Johnson and asked him to turn the probe over to the FBI -- though the police department ultimately completed the investigation independently.""We believe he did was he was charged with what he was doing."" Asked again whether he believes Smollett fabricated the incident, he replied, ""yes.""""This was not an exoneration. To say that he was exonerated by us or anyone is not true.""In answer to questions about the dropping of the charges, Magats initially suggested that it was a question of resources, and that he decided to drop the charges after determining""Our goal and our #1 priority is combatting violent crime and the drivers of violence and we look to our resources to do that and I don't think that Mr. Smollett is a driver of violence or a violent individual.""Magats also said that he was satisfied with Smollett forfeiting the 10 percent of $100K bond he put up, and completing community service prior to getting the charges dropped.""In return for forfeiting his bond to the City of Chicago and doing his community service, we agreed to dismiss the charges against him. He did community service for Operation Push.""An Illinois judge rules that records sealed in the ""hoax attack"" criminal case of ""Empire"" cast member Jussie Smollett be made public, ruling that the actor has not displayed the ""actions of a person seeking to maintain his privacy.""Cook County Circuit Court Judge Steven G.

The video footage also includes Smollett asking the officers to turn off their recording devices, while another group of clips shows the moment when the police apprehend the two brothers who allege they helped Smollett stage the attack."

According to Chicago’s ABC 7 News, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed the indictment, which was reportedly returned by the grand jury on Thursday.

This complicates Smollett’s legal situation significantly; he was originally charged on Feb. 20 with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, but now faces 16 counts.

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, reports ABC 7 News, with the first set of charges related to the initial report Smollett made to police when he told officers that his alleged attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their fists, placed a noose around his neck and poured a chemical liquid on him.

The second set of charges are related to Smollett’s second interview with police, which took place later that same day.

The new set of charges each carry a potential sentence of probation to four years in prison; if he were to convicted on all counts, Smollett could face a maximum sentence of up to 48 years.

Smollett has already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge, and was taken into custody; he is currently free on $100,000 bond.

“Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison,” reports the Chicago news outlet.

Following the indictments, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement via Twitter, noting that the “allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbour & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.”

Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos, however, is firing back by blasting the indictments as “redundant and vindictive,” and an example of “prosecutorial overkill” in order to distract from the Chicago PD’s internal investigation into leaks of information regarding the case.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” said Geragos, as reported by Deadline. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.”

He added: “What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records,” the lawyer asserted. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Smollett is due to return to court on March 14."

Smollett, who was previously charged with one count of disorderly conduct last month, is accused of staging the racial and homophobic attack on himself in January, paying two men to yell slurs at him, pour bleach on him, and wrap a rope around his neck.

According to local news station ABC7 Chicago, the indictment from a Cook County grand jury includes two separate sets of charges: One “related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack,” and another “related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.”

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time… there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment, obtained by CBS Chicago, read.

The new sets of charges reportedly carry a potential sentence of up to four years in prison. The Cook County State’s Attorney's Office confirmed the indictment to ABC7 Chicago.

The actor was originally charged with one felony count related to filing a police report in February. At the time, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called Smollett a “troubled young man” who paid two brothers $3,500 to assault him because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” and wanted to promote his career. The brothers were allegedly told to yell, “This is MAGA country,” and use the n-word.

Johnson alleged Smollett’s deception started when he sent a threatening letter to himself featuring “racial, homophobic and political language.”

“Why would anyone—especially an African-American man—use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson said. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Smollett, who has maintained his innocence, was taken into custody on Feb. 21, and posted $100,000 bond for his release.

Before he was charged, Smollett went on national television and said he was “pissed off” at those who doubted his story.

“It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this,” he told Good Morning America in February. “That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”"

A Cook County grand jury handed down the indictment on Thursday after reviewing information pertaining to Smollett’s claim that he was the victim of a racial, homophobic attack on January 29. Smollett said he was physically attacked by two men who yelled degrading remarks and also left a noose around his neck.

“The new set of charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years,” ABC 7 Chicago reports. Experts believe the actor the will take a plea deal and not serve any jail time.

The grand jury’s indictment is split into two separate sets of charges, the first pertaining to what Smollett initially told officers about the attack, while the second set are related to a second interview Smollett gave police later in the day on the 29th.

The actor was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office on Feb. 20, according to the outlet.

Smollett’s case gained more widespread attention after two of the actor’s acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested in connection with the attack. The brothers told authorities they were paid by the actor to participate in staging the attack. The actor was later arrested, but released on $100,000 bail.

Smollett has repeatedly denied those claims and also pleaded not guilty to the first charge of disorderly conduct after his arrest.

The Chicago Police Department faces an internal investigation of their own after salacious details of Smollett’s case continued to leak during the investigation. The new probe led by the department’s Chief of Detectives, will look into the “inaccurate” information that was fed to the media, TMZ reports, information that heavily weighed the jury of public opinion.

“When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities,” a police spokesperson told the outlet."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett is facing 16 counts of disorderly conduct after a jury returned an indictment against him on Thursday, reports said.

CBS reported that the Cook County grand jury has filed the indictment against him in connection with an allegation of having filed a false police report in January.

Smollet’s lawyer Mark Geragos called the indictment “redundant and vindictive” and said his client “adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office previously charged him with one count of disorderly conduct on Feb. 20, ABC7 noted — he pleaded not guilty.

The indictment came after Smollett, a veteran actor who has also starred in Alien: Covenant and The Mighty Ducks, reported to police that two masked men had shouted homophobic slurs, beat him and wrapped a noose around his neck on Jan. 29.

Smollett was subsequently charged with filing a false police report just under a month later — the charge could bring as many as three years in prison.

Chicago Police have alleged that Smollett paid the two men, brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, $35,000 to stage the attack and that he instructed them to buy the noose at a hardware store.

There are two sets of charges in the indictment, ABC7 noted.

The first concerns what the actor told police following the alleged attack — the allegations that they had yelled slurs, the noose and the beating itself.

Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — An Illinois grand jury has indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office.

The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, Robert Foley, a senior advisor in the state attorney’s office told ABC News.

The first set is related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.

The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day.

The new set of charges each carry a possible sentence of probation to four years, according to WLS. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical substance was poured on him. The alleged assailants yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan, police were told.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series “Empire” is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself last month.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who pleaded not guilty, was released after posting 10 percent of his bond.

Of note, Geragos has represented several high-profile clients, including securing a presidential pardon for Clinton whitewater partner Susan McDougal - later representing her in a 12-count embezzlement trial which she won.

Jussie Smollett has bigger issues than just an untreated drug problem and a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

A Cook County, IL grand jury has just returned a 16-count true bill of charges against the Empire star in connection with a hate crime hoax he allegedly staged in late January, as first reported by CWB Chicago and confirmed by CBS 2. The new charges each carry a potential sentence up to four years in prison if convicted, according to CWB.

Smollett was charged in February with a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, however today's announcement puts him in significantly greater legal jeopardy.

The grand jury's true bill states that Smollett lied about the attack to two separate police officers--the beat cop who took his initial report and a detective who conducted a follow-up interview the same day. In one set of charges, the grand jury found that Smollet filed a false police report around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29th in which he told an officer that he was attacked near 341 East Lower North Water Street by two unknown men who were dressed in black and one of whom wore a ski mask. The jury further found that Smollett told the original officer that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs and struck him in the face with their hands. The police report connected to these charges also indicate that Smollett claimed that a noose had been placed around his neck and a ""chemical"" had been poured on him. The second set of charges returned by the grand jury involves Smollett's alleged false reporting of the incident to a police detective later the same day. Additional details that Smollett apparently included in the second interview include: the men approached him from behind, Smollett fought back, and all three men fell to the ground where Smollett said he was kicked in the back and felt someone pulling on his neck. During this interview, Smollett also told the officer that one offender was a white male wearing a black mask with an open area around the eyes that exposed the attacker's skin, the grand jury found. -CWB Chicago

The actor claimed last month that he was the victim of a predawn hate crime on January 29 in which two men assaulted him while he was on his way home after buying a sandwich; hurling racial and antigay slurs at him, dousing him in a liquid, placing a noose around his neck (which he was still wearing when police arrived later that morning), and punching him in the face.

The incident sparked national outrage - with the left-leaning mainstream media and prominent Democrats uncritically supporting Smollett's version of events; holding it up as a prime example of violent Donald Trump supporters.

The two suspects in the case, Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundario - one of whom has been an extra on Empire, told police that Smollett paid them a combined $3,500 to stage the ""attack,"" and that the three of them had practiced it beforehand. They also said that Smollett was involved in creating a racist letter containing a white substance that was sent to the actor on the Chicago set of Empire.

When the letter failed to achieve the desired level of national outrage, the Osundario brothers say Smollett concocted the hate-crime."

A grand jury in Chicago on Friday returned 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct and false report of offence against the actor, stemming from a “potential hate crime” that he now is said to have falsely claimed in late January.

The charges come on top of the state charges Smollett was hit with last month that could see the actor face up to three years in jail. The new counts are based on false statements Smollett allegedly made to Chicago PD officer and detectives investigating what seemed to be a racist- and homophobic-based attack on him on January 29.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” states the 36-page indictment that officially came down Thursday in Cook County.

Each of the new charges carries a potential sentence of up to three years, though they are usually bundled together as one upon convictions. However, realistically, in cases likes this and with such Class 4 felonies, a plea bargain and probation is likely the outcome rather than a long-term jail sentence – unless Smollett decided he wanted to fight this at trial.

Empire broadcaster Fox said they had no comment on the matter at this time.

However, one of Smollett’s lawyers was very much his typically garrulous self in response.

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,” says Mark Geragos. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.”

“What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,” the CNN contributor added. “This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records,” the lawyer asserted. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Soon after Smollett’s arrest and initial bail hearing late last month, executive producers on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong created drama announced on February 22 that the actor who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the series would be written out of the final two episodes of Empire‘s current season.

“Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” EPs Strong, Daniels, showrunner Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer declared at the time in what was a shift from the solid support offered the actor just days beforehand.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the EPs added. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Officially Empire has not been renewed for an expected sixth season yet, but the show is back for the rest of Season 5 on March 13, the day before Smollett is due to return to court. Those early backend episodes will feature Smollett, I hear.

Out on $100,00 bail, the Todd Pugh, Victor Henderson and cable news regular Geragos legally represented Smollett has always maintained that he is innocent.

However, prosecutors and police in the Windy City where Empire is filmed seem confident in their case.

After Smollett was arrested on February 21, Chicago prosecutors read out in court a lengthy series of text messages between Smollett and brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo that painted a picture of a clearly pre-planned attack. The seemingly damning texts included preparing money to buy supplies, buying drugs, setting up meetings and ensuring that MAGA hats and chants were part of the assault."

A grand jury in Chicago has returned a 16-count felony indictment against television actor Jussie Smollett, accusing him of falsely reporting to police that he was the victim of a hate-crime assault, local media reported on Friday, citing court records.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay and plays a gay character on the Fox network hip-hop drama “Empire,” was previously charged in a single-count criminal complaint with lying to police about a supposed racist and homophobic attack on Jan. 29 by supporters of President Donald Trump.

A spokeswoman for Smollett, 36, who was arrested and later released on $100,000 bond two weeks ago in connection with the initial charge against him, did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment. An attorney for the actor could not immediately be reached for comment.

At least two local television stations reported that a Cook County grand jury charged Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly giving false accounts of an attack on him to police investigators.

At the time he was initially charged, Chicago’s police chief said that Smollett had paid two brothers to stage an assault on him.

According to previous police accounts, Smollett reported that two masked men approached him on a darkened street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, struck him in the face, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

According to the account, the attackers had shouted, “This is MAGA country,” referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police had said."

The charges are related to the actor’s alleged staging of a hate crime against himself in January.

Smollett reportedly told police that two men approached him and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. According to the original account, the two men beat Smollett, placed a noose around his neck and doused him with a chemical substance (believed to be bleach), then fled. Smollett also told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack.

Later developments cast doubt on Smollett’s account, including the questioning of two suspects — a pair of Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked as a personal trainer on a music video of Smollett’s — who were later released without being charged. Smollett’s lawyers have insisted that the actor played no role in his attack.

He was charged in February with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was arrested on Feb. 21; in the press conference that followed, Chicago Police alleged that Smollett staged the attack in order to gain a larger salary at the Fox drama. Smollett was written out of the final two episodes of Empire in response to his legal troubles; the show is mulling the idea of recasting his character, Jamal.

One of Smollett’s attorneys, Mark Geragos, put out the following statement on Friday:

The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

The “Empire” star was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month, in connection to the incident that he reported on Jan. 29 where he said he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately confirm reports of the grand jury’s 16-count indictment against Smollett when reached by TheWrap.

“This is not a newsflash. I expected it,” Mark Geragos, a member of Jussie Smollett’s defense team, told “Access” on Friday. “The way the process operates is they have to do a probable cause proceeding, so this is what’s called a probable cause proceeding. I never thought they would do a preliminary hearing.” Watch the clip here.

Attorneys and representatives for Smollett — who have continuously denied the accusations against him — did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.

“As Supt Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model,” Chicago Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Friday, after the news broke. “We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.”

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

The actor’s bail was set at $100,000, with Smollett required to post $10,000 (10 percent) for release. His next court date has been set for Thursday, March 14 at 11:30 a.m CST.

Smollett’s team put out this statement after the actor was released: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.” However, the following day, executive producers announced that they had decided to remove the actor — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon — from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” read the statement from “Empire” co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, showrunner Brett Mahoney, and executive producers Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the statement continued. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The decision to remove Smollett from the remaining episodes of Season 5 comes after “Empire” studio 20th Century Fox stated last month it was “considering [its] options” following the news of his arrest. A day earlier, the studio had renewed its support for the actor, saying, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

Representatives for Fox did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on this story.

During a press conference last month, hours after Smollett’s surrender on Feb. 21, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the actor staged an attack on himself because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He also told reporters the police were in possession of a $3,500 check, which he said Smollett used to pay brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo for the incident.

The Fox drama’s star is making around $125,000 per episode of “Empire,” an individual with knowledge told TheWrap, who added there had been no salary dispute between Smollett and the studio and that he had never even approached them about a raise.

Last week, the Osundairo brothers released a statement through their lawyer Gloria Schmidt expressing “tremendous regret” for their participation.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” Schmidt said in a statement provided to TheWrap last Thursday.

TheWrap reached out to Schmidt immediately after we received the statement to ask if the brothers — who were initially persons of interest and turned out to have both worked on “Empire” — still fully maintain their story that Smollett paid them to stage an assault in Chicago on Jan. 29. Schmidt did not respond to our question.

The Osundairos were released without charges Feb. 15, following an arrest and 48-hour hold, after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, Fox received a letter threatening Smollett. In mid-February, ABC News reported that the FBI and U.S. Postal Service were looking into the possibility that Smollett had sent the threatening letter to himself, or played a role in its creation and delivery."

According to The Hollywood Reporter, all 16 charges stem from him allegedly lying to police about a hate crime attack that he has since become suspected of orchestrating.

Smollett previously surrendered himself to police and was booked on the false police report charges. He was released after posting the $100,000 bail.

Police have alleged that they believe he manufactured the situation in order to further his acting career by gaining notoriety for being assaulted over his race and sexual orientation.

Two brothers named Abel and Ola Osundairo have claimed that Smollett hired them to help carry out the fake attack, and have stated to police that he paid them to do so.

Smollett's legal team previously issued a statement on the allegations that he fabricated the assault, reaffirming his declaration of innocence following his bail hearing and release.

""Mr. Smollet is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,"" the statement began.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the statement added.

Consequently, Smollett was released from Empire for the remainder of the current season, following his arrest. The show's producers issued a joint statement regarding the decision, explaining that it was a difficult choice.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us” read the statement from Empire executives Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement continued.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in filing a false report, court documents show. All 16 counts are Class 4 felonies, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of one-to-three years in prison. Probation is also possible.

The indictment issued by the grand jury Friday lays out two separate sets of charges against the actor. The first set alleges that Smollett lied to responding officers immediately following the reported attack.

Specifically, the charges allege that Smollett made false statements about the nature of the attack, telling officers that the attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him, according to the indictment.

The second set of charges alleges that Smollett made false statements to detectives in a follow-up interview about the case.

""Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful and if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor and respected him as a role model,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. ""We stand behind the work of our detectives.""

Smollett's attorneys told NBC News that they have yet to review the documents, but that they will ""push back against"" the charges filed against their client.

Mark Geragos, an attorney for Smollett, later released a statement saying the indictment was ""not unexpected.""

""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said. ""This redundant andvindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" he said.

20th Century Fox Television declined to comment on the new charges against the actor.

Smollett was previously charged in February with one felony count of disorderly conduct in filing a false police report.

Chicago police said in a press conference announcing the initial charge that Smollett sent a ""false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself and staged a hate crime attack in Chicago because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

Authorities had previously said new information ""shifted"" their investigation of the reported assault, in which Smollett told authorities he was physically attacked as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant on Jan. 29. He said two masked men shouted racial, anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" as they looped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him before running away.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's legal team said in a statement when he was initially charged. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Smollett is due back in court on March 14."

Friday afternoon, prosecutors announced that a Cook County grand jury finally wrapped up its investigation into Smollett’s alleged “hate crime” hoax, and returned a 16-count indictment against the actor in connection with the January 29th incident, in which Smollett claimed he was approached and beaten by two Trump supporters.

CBS Chicago reports that the “jury returned 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct against the actor for allegedly staging a hate crime attack.” The grand jury also reportedly accused Smollett of falsifying a crime.

Local news source, CWB Chicago, also says that the “grand jury’s true bill states that Smollett lied about the attack to two separate police officers — the beat cop who took his initial report and a detective who conducted a follow-up interview the same day.”

These charges are in addition to the “felony disorderly conduct — false report” Smollett was hit with last month. Cook County prosecutors decided to charge Smollett with the single count while awaiting the decision of a so-called “John Doe” jury, which sits daily in Chicago criminal court and analyzes evidence presented without knowledge of the perpetrator. Although prosecutors had already issued the single charge, the grand jury, apparently, was still processing evidence supplied by the Chicago Police Department.

Each new charge carries a potential jail sentence of up to four years.

The Chicago grand jury supplied its decision in two parts. In the first part, “the grand jury found that Smollet filed a false police report around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29th in which he told an officer that he was attacked near 341 East Lower North Water Street by two unknown men who were dressed in black and one of whom wore a ski mask,” according to CWB. The jury issued a separate charge for each independent statement regarding a crime made during Smollett’s interview; one charge for alleging racial slurs, one charge for accusations that the perpetrators threw a noxious substance on Smollett, and so on.

In the second set of charges, the grand jury analyzed “Smollett’s alleged false reporting of the incident to a police detective later the same day.” Again, the jury returned one count for each individual false statement, this time including counts for Smollett’s description of his attackers.

Unfortunately for Smollett, he is also awaiting the outcome of a Federal investigation involving the United States Postal Inspector, over whether Smollett mailed a threatening letter, containing a “white powder” that turned out to be crushed Tylenol, to himself using the United States Postal Service.

Smollett, of course, insists that his story — that he was attacked by two Trump supporters screaming racial and homophobic slurs and brandishing bleach and a rope, outside his downtown Chicago apartment at 2am on January 29th, after returning from buying a sandwich at a local 24-hour Subway shop — is absolutely true.

Smollett is due to appear in court next week on the first charge. His attorneys have not specified how he will answer this new set of charges, but Smollett will likely be processed on the new charges during his upcoming appointment because he is already out on bond."

Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling, W.Va., and East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, will collectively lay off about 70 employees, effective immediately, according to The Intelligencer.

The layoffs represent 5 percent to 6 percent of the hospitals' combined workforce of more than 1,200.



The hospitals' parent company, Alecto, attributed the job cuts to national trends among rural hospitals, such as declining inpatient care, decreases in Medicare reimbursement and the expense of maintaining aging facilities, according to the report, which cites a company news release.



Alecto, which bought the struggling hospitals in 2017, said the hospitals ""have operated at an unfair disadvantage in the marketplace.""



Daniel Dunmyer, president and CEO of both hospitals, said the cuts were necessary.



He told The Intelligencer: ""We have been working very hard to achieve reductions in operating costs while improving efficiencies. Unfortunately, these measures have not yet resulted in sufficient cost savings to our hospitals.



""Our administrative team reviewed the staffing levels in each department to ensure the operational needs of the two facilities continue to be met, as well as to address areas where changes can be made. As a result of the ongoing need for cost reduction, we have determined that it is prudent to implement a restructuring of our current workforce,"" said Mr. Dunmyer.



He did not indicate what positions are affected by the layoffs. According to the report, those affected are eligible for rehire if they qualify for a hospital job, and they are being offered unemployment compensation and continued health coverage.

Jussie Smollett has been hit with an additional 15 counts of filing a false police report by a grand jury and is now facing up to 48 years behind bars.

The Empire actor was initially charged with one Class 4 Felony charge of disorderly conduct last month but a grand jury has applied that charge 15 times over in an 36-page indictment that was returned on Thursday.

Now, he is facing a maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars and fines of up to $400,000.

He is expected to cut a plea deal with authorities, according to experts cited by ABC.

Neither Smollett's legal team nor Cook County prosecutors have commented on the new indictment which was first reported by CWB.

DailyMail.com obtained a copy of it this afternoon. It divides the 15 new charges into two sets.

Counts one to seven apply to the comments he made to police officer Muhammed Baig, who first responded to his apartment when his friend called 911 on January 29.

The second set applies to Detective Kim Murray who interviewed him later that day.

Jussie Smollett reported that one of his attackers was a male white, in dark clothing Grand Jury indictment

She is who Smollett told, according to the indictment, that one of his attackers was a 'white male'.

He told Baig that he had been attacked by two 'unknown males' who were dressed in black.

One was wearing a ski mask and they called him 'racial and homophobic slurs', he said.

Smollett told Baig they hit him 'about the face' with their hands and poured an 'unknown chemical substance' onto them.

Later, in his interview with Kim Murray that he 'fought back'. The indictment reads: 'Jussie Smollett reported that one of his attackers was a male white, in dark clothing.'

Nigerian brothers, Ola (right) and Abel Osundairo (left) told police Smollett paid them to attack him

The actor has not been charged for allegedly sending himself a threatening letter days before the attack, as police have alleged.

Smollett is accused of hiring brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to beat him up outside his apartment on January 29 in what he later described to police as a racist and homophobic attack.

Jussie Smollett is shown in the hospital with the scratches police say he gave himself after the 'attack'

The brothers say he paid them $3500 to do it and that he promised them an additional $500 which they would get when they came home from a trip to Nigeria.

They say Smollett's motive was that he wanted a higher salary on Empire.

The actor went on Good Morning America before he was arrested where he cried and insisted he was telling the truth amid a swelling tide of public cynicism.

Fox has said it is 'considering its options' in light of Smollett's arrest.

He will not appear in the final two episodes of Empire that are to be shown later this year.

On Friday, after the indictment was returned, the network declined to comment.

The actor's lawyers say he has been the victim of police and prosecutorial misconduct.

They say his presumption of innocence was 'trampled' and that the entire investigation into the attack has been flawed."

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in filing a false report, court documents show. All 16 counts are Class 4 felonies, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of one-to-three years in prison. Probation is also possible.

The indictment issued by the grand jury Friday lays out two separate sets of charges against the actor. The first set alleges that Smollett lied to responding officers immediately following the reported attack.

Specifically, the charges allege that Smollett made false statements about the nature of the attack, telling officers that the attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him, according to the indictment.

The second set of charges alleges that Smollett made false statements to detectives in a follow-up interview about the case.

""Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful and if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor and respected him as a role model,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. ""We stand behind the work of our detectives.""

Smollett's attorneys told NBC News that they have yet to review the documents, but that they will ""push back against"" the charges filed against their client.

Mark Geragos, an attorney for Smollett, later released a statement saying the indictment was ""not unexpected.""

""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said. ""This redundant andvindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" he said.

20th Century Fox Television declined to comment on the new charges against the actor.

Smollett was previously charged in February with one felony count of disorderly conduct in filing a false police report.

Chicago police said in a press conference announcing the initial charge that Smollett sent a ""false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself and staged a hate crime attack in Chicago because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

Authorities had previously said new information ""shifted"" their investigation of the reported assault, in which Smollett told authorities he was physically attacked as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant on Jan. 29. He said two masked men shouted racial, anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" as they looped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him before running away.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's legal team said in a statement when he was initially charged. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Smollett is due back in court on March 14."

5:48 PM PT: Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, tells The Blast in an explosive statement, ""The fact of an indictment is not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.""

He adds, ""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

He also says, ""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

Jussie Smollett is now facing 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct after a grand jury in Cook County filed a new indictment over allegations he staged an attack against himself.

The grand jury indictment came down on Thursday after the ""Empire"" star had previously been charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police.

According to CBS Chicago, the indictment reads, ""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.""

Smollett claimed to have been attacked by two men on January 29, alleging they screamed racist and homophobic slurs at him. He also claimed to have had bleach thrown on him and a noose.

Superintendent Eddie Johnson, in a heated press conference last month, said police now believed Smollett staged the attack with the help of two brothers.

""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" Johnson said.

Smollett was eventually arrested and released on $100,000 bail.

Last week, Smollett was seen in public for the first time since his release from jail, grabbing dinner with his family in Chicago.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime, NBC News confirmed Friday.

Smollett was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct for the alleged false report he made with Chicago police on Jan. 29, according to the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. In it he claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett was charged by a grand jury of 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for making a false report, according to a criminal complaint.

Smollett and his attorneys have denied the allegations against him. Mark Geragos, who represents Smollett, said in a statement to NBC News on Friday that the indictment was ""the prosecutorial overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records,"" Geragos said.

Police said Thursday they are looking for people within the department who may have leaked investigation details to the press prior to Smollett's arrest.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay, said his attackers poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck. Authorities then began to investigate the case a potential hate crime.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told NBC News at the time of his arrest in late February that the investigation into the alleged attack demanded ""considerable"" police resources. He said that at one point the department had 12 detectives scouring surveillance videos.

Some social media users began to cast doubt on Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

Police also had said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records for the investigation. The actor had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

Police have said, however, that Smollett was cooperating with the investigation, and later gave investigators a PDF file with partial phone records.

Guglielmi said on Feb. 16 that the investigation shifted after questioning two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were potential persons of interest in the case.

Just days later, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for the alleged false report.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said after Smollett’s arrest that the actor “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Johnson claimed that Smollett was unhappy with his salary on Fox’s “Empire” and Smollett sent himself a letter containing racist language, and when that did not work, he paid $3,500 to orchestrate the attack.

Fox had no comment on Smollett's indictment in response to NBC News' inquiry Friday.

The top prosecutor in the Chicago area, Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx, recused herself from the case in February because she had had ""conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department,"" a spokesperson for the office said."

This week, motorists along Route 422 in Worthington, Pennsylvania, were greeted by a new billboard displaying three slides: ""Whites Have Rights, Too,"" ""‘Black Racists' Men and Women in Congress"" and a third featuring actor Jussie Smollett, who is mixed race and currently being investigated for allegedly falsifying a police report.

Pennsylvania resident and self-proclaimed ""patriot"" John Placek, who is white, maintains that he is not a bigot for purchasing the ad space for his messages. Instead, he asserts the billboard is meant to provoke ""conversation,"" according to Pittsburgh outlet WPXI.

For clarity, the blacked out sections of the image are dead pixels on the billboard itself.

The conversation, however, is not going as Placek hoped.

In particular, his ""Black Racists"" slide featuring several members of the US House of Representatives (all Democrats) such as Ilhan Omar, Maxine Waters and even civil rights leader John Lewis, has drawn extreme criticism from the American public on and offline.

""I don't see it as thought-provoking… I don't see it as instigating thoughtful discussion as much as it is provoking and agitating,"" Michael Allshouse, a local white man, told WPXI. ""I do view it as racist.""

Despite Placek telling the outlet he believes there is one race — the human race — his negative portrayal of Smollett and black representatives makes many question his intent. Nevertheless the Worthington resident stands by his assertion that he wants to bring ""unity"" to the nation.

""We gotta get people talking,"" he said. ""We gotta get them excited. And that's what I've done. The board was never meant to hurt anybody. I would never do that. I'm a patriot. I'm an American. Period.""

It's unclear what Placek wants people to get ""excited"" about, at least judging by his ad space, but netizens believe they've filled in the blanks concerning the billboard.

This is what a certified fool does with his money, instead he should donate to a worthy cause

Last month, Smollett was initially charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct but local source CWBChicago has reported the grand jury has now delivered a total of 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct-false report.

The report reveals the Empire star lied to two separate officers. The first set of charges reveals the time of the police report, which was 2 a.m. on January 29 and included details of the assault, which revealed the reported racial slurs, noose, and chemical pour. The second charges are for telling a false report to a detective the same day, while adding he was approached from behind and fought back, including details of skin color and being kicked in the back.

No charges in connection to the letter that was reportedly sent to himself.

Each charge carries a sentence that could range from probation to four years, however, the publication states he is unlikely to be convicted on all of the crimes, with the likelihood of reaching a plea bargain, resulting in one or two charges being plead guilty.

Gayle King recently appeared on The Tonight Show with Stephen Colbert to talk about her interview with R. Kelly. The pair discussed everything from when King met with Kelly 15 minutes before the interview, as well as the viral photo that shows her staring forward intently while the R&B singer stands over her and appears to be yelling.

“I could see him getting more heated. He was upset with me about some of the questions…he was a little irritated,” King said of the photo which was taken by her makeup artist. “When I see Robert getting really upset and he stands out of his seat, my initial reaction is ‘Oh god, please don’t leave, please don’t leave, please don’t leave.’ Because we’ve seen him storm out of interviews before, so I thought he was gonna do that.”

“I decided if I sit there quietly, make eye contact with him…he would know I’m not going anywhere and I’ll just wait for you to finish whatever this is and then you’ll sit back in the seat. And he did that,” King continued.

Elsewhere in the interview, King also addressed the mix-up that occurred on Fox News. During Fox News’ The Five show, Jesse Watters had offered kudos to King’s interview while also mistaking her for ABC’s Robin Roberts.

“Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco,” Watters says before being corrected by co-host dana Perino.

“That was not Gayle King…Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview,” Perino says.

In response to the mix-up, King said that she reached out to Perino via email and told her the following;

“Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I, it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people. And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?” See Also Culture Watch Jay-Z Discuss Meek Mill’s Arrest And Probation In First Trailer For ‘Free Meek’ Docuseries

During her appearance, King reportedly also shared an exclusive clip from her Kelly interview where she asks him why he continues to see young women.

“Why do I continue to see women?” Kelly asks, with King responding, “I’m not saying women — you know what I’m talking about.”

“I know older women as well,” Kelly replies. “I know 43 years old, bodies tight, they cool, I go out with them, I kick it with them. I love women.”

In related news, Kelly’s lawyer from his 2008 trial recently said that the singer was “guilty as hell,” as well as revealed that he took libido-killing shots to suppress his urges."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Each of the Empire actor’s new charges carries a possible sentence of probation to four years in prison, but ABC Eyewitness News reports that experts believe Smollett will likely avoid jail time by striking a plea deal. Smollett previously pleaded not guilty to his charge in February of disorderly conduct after the investigation into his alleged attack turned on him, with Chicago police claiming the actor staged the attack out of dissatisfaction with his Empire salary.

The new charges fall into two different categories, ABC reports. The first resulted from the actor’s initial testimony about his attack, and the second from his second interview with police later that same day. The threatening, racist letter Smollett said he received prior to the attack, which Chicago police said was the actor’s first attempt to gain attention, is still being investigated at the F.B.I.’s crime lab, Eyewitness News reports.

Representatives for Smollett did not immediately respond to V.F.’s request for comment.

*The original post continues below.

Although stories about Michael Jackson and R. Kelly’s respective legal woes have overtaken public conversation in recent days, the bizarre case of Jussie Smollett’s allegedly phony attack is likely to resurface as the Empire actor heads back to court in Chicago next week. In February, the actor was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report after allegedly staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself, and was released on $100,000 bail. As the case has unfolded, Smollett has maintained his innocence. But as Smollett prepares to return to court, other local institutions have faced upheaval of their own.

On Wednesday, a local CBS affiliate reported that dozens of employees at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Smollett was treated following his attack, had been fired for allegedly accessing Smollett’s medical records. In a report from the same affiliate Thursday, sources estimated that the hospital had fired upwards of 60 employees, and perhaps more, in connection with the Smollett case. (Northwestern Memorial declined to comment due to personnel and HIPAA constraints.) And on Friday, news broke that Chicago police have launched an internal probe of their own to find out who was responsible for leaking details about their investigation last month.

Multiple Northwestern Memorial employees, many of whom work as medical assistants or in an administrative capacity, claim that they never accessed Smollett’s records, and that they were fired without being asked any questions or given the opportunity to speak on their own behalf, “even in cases where Smollett’s name only appeared on their computer screens,” CBS reports. “I think because he’s famous, he’s a known celebrity, that’s why they made a big deal out of it,” one of the fired employees told the affiliate. The ex-staffers believe the hospital’s human-resources department went too far. As one former customer-service specialist put it, “It hurts after being there for 20 years.” The specialist added that she actually was authorized to enter Smollett’s chart in order to complete and release it.

Meanwhile, Chicago Police Sergeant Rocco Alioto has confirmed that the department has opened an investigation into which police officers and officials might have leaked information during their initial probe of Smollett’s attack. He added, “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation. . . As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”"

The Fox News host Jesse Watters confused the two black journalists on Wednesday, praising King for ""redeeming herself"" for an interview that Roberts had done.

Watters has apologized for the mistake.

King told the ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that she had reached out to Watters' colleague Dana Perino and asked her to ""let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people don't look alike.""

Gayle King, the ""CBS This Morning"" host who recently earned praise for her composure during an emotional interview with R. Kelly, spoke out about the Fox News host who confused her with Robin Roberts, the anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

Fox News' Jesse Watters praised King on a Wednesday episode of ""The Five"" for ""totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco.""

But his cohost Dana Perino quickly stepped in to correct him, saying King had not conducted a recent, highly criticized interview with the actor Jussie Smollett; Roberts had.

""Oh, I knew that,"" Watters responded before apologizing for the mistake.

Watters had been referring to Roberts' interview with Smollett on February 12, just days before Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report about an attack the Chicago police believe he staged.

Roberts was accused of being too sympathetic to Smollett during the interview and failing to challenge him on certain inconsistencies with his story.

Watters drew scorn for mixing up the two prominent black journalists, and on Thursday evening, the ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert asked King to weigh in on the situation.

""Oh my gosh, Stephen. I couldn't believe this,"" King said. ""I just thought, OK. That's all right, dude. That's OK.'""

King said she emailed Perino to thank her for standing up for her on-air — and to request she convey a message to her colleagues at Fox News.

And King did not let the mistake go by silently.

King revealed Thursday night on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” that she wrote an email to his co-host, Dana Perino, thanking her after she fact-checked him on-air.

While speaking about R. Kelly’s sexual abuse case as well as his child support battle, Watters made remarks about King, who is the first reporter to have an interview with the disgraced singer in recent months following a docuseries that aired in January about his alleged indiscretions with underage girls.

The commentator praised King for how she handled R. Kelly, who at one point became irate and ranted in front of her and the cameras. ""Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco,” he said. But the problem is that it was Roberts, not King, who conducted the interview with Smollett about his alleged racist attack in Chicago.

As a co-host went on to speak, Perino interjected to set the record straight, telling Watters, “That was not Gayle King...Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview."" Watters responded, “Oh, I knew that” as his co-hosts laughed before he went on to apologize.

During her guest spot with Colbert, King, who hosts “CBS This Morning,” told him what her email to Perino said. “Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I, it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people. And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?”"

Kelly on CBS This Morning to discuss the multiple allegations of sexual abuse against him—where he threw a temper tantrum in the middle of their conversation, earning him a crying meme fit to replace Michael Jordan’s—King shared the backstory Thursday night on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. And apparently the Kelly interview was as off the rails behind the scenes as it was on screen. Four anecdotes from King’s interview with the singer stand out:

He Keeps A Christmas Tree Year Round Since 1993

Having only met Kelly once at a birthday party five years ago, King decided to go to the singer’s apartment at Chicago’s Trump Tower to introduce herself 15 minutes before the interview was set to go down. When she arrived, she said he was sitting in sweatpants “resting his voice” next to a Christmas tree that he’s had up since 1993. Whether it's the same tree since 1993 is unknown but King did explain to Colbert that Kelly keeps the tree up “as a tribute to his mother, he loves his mother, it was her favorite holiday.” I mean, that’s fine, but have you ever tried to keep a Christmas tree even a few weeks passed its prime? The amount of bristles that must be on his floor! This begs me to ask, were they sitting next to a depressingly bare stick of a tree or is this some kind of magical tree kept alive by rich people water? Or does he buy a new Christmas tree every week? I just want to know more about the tree, and I don't exactly know why.

That Viral Interview Photo Was Taken By a Rogue Makeup Artist

King casually dropped the tidbit that the now-infamous photo of Kelly flailing his fist up while towering over her calm professional majesty was taken by her makeup artist, Lazarus, that she didn’t even know was in the room. And Lazarus, who she says just happens to be a really great photographer, somehow took over 800 pictures that night, she told Colbert. Lazarus is stealthy!

Having a Yelling R. Kelly In Your Face Doesn’t Scare You If You’re Gayle Motherfucking King

When it came to the actual outburst heard ‘round the internet, King wasn’t so much worried for her safety, or even pissed off at this alleged abuser for disrespectfully yelling over her attempts to reign him in. When Colbert asked what she was really thinking behind that poker face, apparently she was most concerned about finishing the interview. Professionalism!

“My initial thought was, ‘Please don’t leave. Please don’t leave. Please don’t leave,’ because I thought ‘I’m not done with my questions,’” she told Colbert. She explained that she never thought he would hurt her intentionally and only worried for a moment that she could get hit by accident, but agreed the picture does look “menacing.” So, with her eye on the prize, King pressed on. “I thought I’ll just be calm, say his name. Because you know if someone says your name it is calming,” she shared. That’s how we got that incredible moment in the interview where she interrupts his tantrum by saying his name with all the authority of a disappointed mother.

In the Aftermath King Had to Check Fox News For Thinking She Was Robin Roberts

On Fox News’s show The Five on Wednesday, commentator Jesse Watters tried to give King her props for her composure during the interview with a backhanded compliment, saying it was better than when she interviewed Jussie Smollett. But his co-panelist Dana Perino embarrassingly let him know he was confusing King with black journalist Robin Roberts who interviewed Smollett on ABC. King told Colbert she emailed Perino to thank her for that. She told Colbert that the email read, “Thank you for letting [Watters] know we’re two different people. And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike.” Yes, Gayle!

“It’s good to remind ‘em every so often,” Colbert said laughing.

Police in Chicago have reportedly opened an internal investigation in connection with the case involving “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, whose report of an apparent hate crime in January later came into question.

The AP reports that the probe is aimed at determining the source of information that was leaked anonymously to the media while police were investigating Smollett’s claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29.

“Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month,” the AP reports, adding: “Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men’s help and made a false police report.”

The report adds: “Guglielmi says no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.”"

Williams is a field representative with the Leadership Institute, a non-profit founded by veteran activist Morton C. Blackwell, which, according to its website, “provides training in campaigns, fundraising, grassroots, organizing, youth politics, and communications” to future conservative leaders.

Part of Williams’ job requirement includes helping conservative college students start clubs on their campus, which led him to table with students at UC-Berkeley on February 19. While tabling, Williams was assaulted by someone who police claim is 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg.

Less than two weeks after the assault, Williams was telling his story to thousands of people alongside the President of the United States.

In an interview with The Daily Wire, Williams said he started calling himself a conservative in college but has always held conservative views.

“I became a conservative by thinking for myself — not following what everyone was telling me to think,” Williams said. “When I cut through the trendy opinions, I came to appreciate conservative values like free speech.”

Williams said he looks up to Morton Blackwell, Antonin Scalia, and President Donald Trump.

“Also, freedom of speech is important to me because political correctness is a corrosive force to the arts, specifically comedy,” Williams added.

Prior to his trip to Berkeley, Williams said he had some concerns due to the Berkeley community’s reputation for intolerance against individuals with opposing views, but said he “didn’t expect it to be this bad.”

While at UC-Berkeley, Williams was tabling with two conservative students while holding signage that referenced the Jussie Smollett controversy.

“A guy approached the table and was cussing and I didn’t know if he was going to try to hurt us or the signage,” Williams said, explaining why he started to film the encounter.

“He took a step back as he was walking away, and then [Greenberg] smacked my phone out of my hand which hit the guy that was cussing at me,” Williams explained. “It landed on the ground and then he flipped the table and smacked my phone out of my hand again.”

“At one point, he took my phone … and when he punched me in the head, my phone was in his hand.”

Williams said he got his phone back after he grabbed Greenberg’s sweater and thought the assault was over.

“I look down at my phone because I thought that he was done yelling in my face, and that is when he hit me with the big one.”

After Greenberg left, Williams said the police were quick to respond and even brought along two fire trucks and an ambulance. Williams did not use the ambulance, but he did go to a hospital a few days later due to concussion symptoms.

“My sinuses were damaged and the punch caused internal bleeding within my face,” Williams said. “My ears were ringing and I was sensitive to light and sounds and had a headache. [The doctors] said that there was a high likelihood that I had a concussion.”

When asked if the school’s administration has reached out to him, Williams said he has only heard from the university’s police department.

With his black eye healing, Williams made his way last weekend to the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, where he was scheduled to speak about being assaulted with Campus Reform’s Editor-in-Chief, Lawrence Jones.

“This was my first time ever going to CPAC,” Williams stated. “It was just so comforting to have an outpouring of support from people who were just outraged about what happened to me.”

The next day, Williams said he planned to “take it easy” and enjoy the conference, but then he was told that he may be meeting President Trump.

“I was very excited about this and I had no idea if I would actually meet him, but it was phenomenal. Right after I met him, I was being escorted to the audience by a staff member who told me that ‘we’re going to put you close to the stage for easy access,’ and that’s when I realized that I might go on stage.’”

Williams said he started immediately planning out what he would say if Trump asked him to come on stage.

“I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face, violently punched, and I said ‘that’s disgusting,’ by a bully — I’d like to do a lot of things but — but of course we would never do that,” Trump said during his CPAC speech. “So, the man’s name is Hayden Williams. Where’s Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden come up here, please.”

Williams then made his way to the stage.

“So, at the Leadership Institute, we are committed to making campuses great again and I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak,” Williams began. “It’s great that I am being recognized, but there are so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse if they dare to speak up on campus. So I am glad that we could, we could, you know, bring this to the forefront.”

“And these students do it because they have a love for our nation and freedom and a love for you Mr. President,” Williams added. “If you keep defending us, we’ll keep defending you.”

Trump then asked Williams to remain on the stage and congratulated him.

“I learned a number of things — first of all, he can take a punch,” Trump said. “Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take them. You weren’t going to go down no matter how — that was a hell of a hard punch, he was a strong guy.”

“When I went up, it was unreal and a dream come true for him to allow me to speak at one of his longest speeches to date,” Williams said. “I was incredibly nervous, but who wouldn’t be?”

On Wednesday, Greenberg pleaded not guilty to three felonies for assault, battery, and criminal threats, The Daily Wire previously reported.

Williams’ attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, said that it was not surprising that Greenberg pled not guilty.

“It is customary for criminal defendants to enter a not guilty plea, so I’m not surprised by that,” Dhillon said, adding that Greenberg has also had “several instances in civil court.”

Williams said he hopes Greenberg is “held fully accountable for his actions, so that campuses can be safer for all students and that people like him don’t feel so emboldened to use violence to express their disagreements with others.”

While Williams is happy that his situation is raising awareness, he said there is a lot more work still to be done.

“It is clear that there is a problem that needs to be addressed concerning the dehumanization of conservatives,” Williams said.

In the interview, Williams stressed that conservatives should not be afraid to speak up, even if violence is a possibility.

“With no risk, there is no reward and it is certainly a risk to put your beliefs out there if they are counter to the dominant culture,” Williams said, adding that he believes his situation has not deterred conservative activism but has actually encouraged it.

“Many students have contacted me saying that they were inspired to get more involved,” Williams said. “Now that they’ve seen how big the problem is, they feel that now is the time to get involved. They can’t be apathetic anymore.”

Although Greenberg is not a student, Williams said hostility happens on other campuses and that the incident is a sign of an issue with our culture.

“He represents a certain culture that is enabled by these left-wing faculty. The media also contributes to this problem because we were protesting the hate crime hoax by Jussie Smollett and the media fan the flames of this hysteria.” Williams said. “Berkeley is a special case certainly, but this happens on campuses across the country, and this guy represents this culture that is enabled when culture of harassment against conservatives is encouraged.”

Fox News reported that one UC-Berkeley employee, Yuvi Panda, cheered on the assault in a now-deleted tweet, writing “OH MY GOD THE MAGA PEOPLE ON UC BERKELEY CAMPUS YESTERDAY GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY SOMEONE THIS MAKES ME FEEL EMOTIONALLY SO MUCH BETTER.”

“Berkeley led the way in the free speech movement and now they’re leading the way in the anti-free speech movement,” Williams said.

Williams said he does not plan on leaving politics any time soon and plans to continue “to help young conservatives get involved in the public policy process” and raise awareness “about the vital importance of free speech to keeping the peace between us all.”"

Several local media outlets, including ABC7 and CBS Chicago, reported on Feb. 14 that police believed the “Empire” actor had faked the Jan. 29 hate attack, citing law enforcement sources. At the time, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied the reports, calling ABC7’s sources “uninformed and inaccurate.”

The reports turned out to be correct, as Smollett was subsequently arrested and charged with filing a false police report. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson held a press conference on Feb. 21 calling Smollett’s conduct “despicable.” The department is now seeking to determine who released information without official approval.

“An internal investigation has been opened,” Sgt. Rocco Alioto said in a statement. “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation. As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

Smollett told police that he was assaulted while out walking at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He alleged that two assailants shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Prosecutors claim that Smollett hired his personal trainer, Abel Osundairo, and brother Ola Osundairo, to stage the assault.

Smollett has denied the allegation and has been suspended from the show."

The Nigerian brothers who beat Jussie Smollett in an allegedly staged attack in January have been seen for the first time since they told police about their involvement in the 'hoax'.

In photographs obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, Abel and Ola Osundairo are seen in Chicago with their pet parrot Nick.

They refused to answer questions about Smollett, who they say paid them $3,500 to beat him up on January 29 in an attack he allegedly planned as leverage to get a higher salary.

Smollett denies the claims and will return to court on March 14 to face a felony charge of filing a false police report.

Abel, 27, and Ola, 25, were coy as they dodged questions.

Ola refused to answer questions about the case, saying: 'We can’t talk about that right now, we appreciate your concern.'

Abel, who had a parrot on his shoulder, later added: 'We said what we said bro.'

Ola then plugged their personal fitness Instagram account which they used again for the first time in weeks on Thursday night to share a photograph of themselves shirtless. The brothers then got into waiting car and were driven away.

They accompanied their Instagram post on Thursday night with the caption: 'I'm ABEL'.

They confessed to police on February 20th that Smollett hired them to beat him up and told them to make it appear as though it was a racist and homophobic attack on January 29.

They then fled to Nigeria and were out of the country while Smollett performed to sold-out shows and arranged interviews with national media.

The brothers were picked up by police on February 20th as they arrived back in Chicago.

They were questioned by police for 47 hours before finally telling them that Smollett was behind the entire attack.

Smollett, who met the pair when they appeared on Empire as extras, denies their version of events but is yet to offer an explanation for much of the evidence police say they have.

The brothers were in high spirits despite the scandal

There was a car waiting for the pair in the parking lot. They refused to answer questions as they made their way towards it but said they 'appreciated' the 'concern'

A check he gave the brothers for $3,500 was labeled as payment for a workout and nutrition program and it was dated January 23, four days before the attack.

Police say the actor deliberately backdated it to make it appear innocent and said he was in fact paying them for the attack.

They claim to have video proof of Smollett in a car with the pair days before the incident when they said he was concocting their story.

Footage has already emerged of the brothers buying ski masks and other props to use in the attack.

In this case, CBS’ Gayle King and ABC’s Robin Roberts.

Yes, they are both light-skinned black women, but that’s it. And what does King have to say about it? What you would expect and what she should have: “All black people do not look alike.”

The super faux pas went down Wednesday during the Fox news show “The Five” in which Watters praised King’s R. Kelly interview and described the singer as “acting like a child, throwing a tantrum and acting like he was the victim.”

“Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the (Jussie) Smollett fiasco,” Watters concluded his remarks.

Only problem is, that wasn’t King who interviewed Smollett. It was Roberts. Duh!!

As we all know, Roberts caught a lot of flack following her “Good Morning America” interview with Smollett about the now discredited attack against him in February. He ended up being arrested for filing a false police report. Authorities concluded it was a hoax he cooked up to promote his career.

But as far as King is concerned,she’s being showered with nothing but praise for keeping cool while R. Kelly commenced to act a complete fool, screaming and crying during her “CBS This Morning” interview with about his alleged sexual abuse, which he vehemently denied.

Watters’ Fox News associate, Dana Perino stepped in to correct him, saying: “That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.”

“I knew that,” Watters responded, before covering his head in embarrassment. “Sorry for Robin Roberts out there. … I apologize.”

Well, as they say, it’ was caught on video and will live forever. In any event, King couldn’t resist sticking it to Watters and Fox on Thursday when she appeared on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”

Could you please just share that?’ Yes I did.”"

A police rep says the investigation began after the “Empire” actor was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month.

Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with the help of two men and made a false police report.

Police say no alleged leakers have been identified so far and no officers or department staffers have been disciplined for releasing information.

“I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Chicago P.D. Sgt. Rocco Alioto said in a statement. “As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

The announcement of the internal investigation came on the same day as a report from CBS 2 Chicago which claimed that many workers and nurses at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago may have been fired for inappropriately accessing Smollett’s medical records.

The 36-year-old actor was treated at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital after allegedly being attacked in January.

“Any time you get law enforcement drip-drip-drip leaks, that to me is a telltale sign that something else is going on here,” Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos said while on CNN. “I haven’t seen anything except leaks according to law enforcement sources. To me, that screams out somebody is trying to manipulate something.”

In February, Chicago Police Sup. Eddie Johnson said the “Empire” actor “still has the presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.”

Johnson told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts that, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Johnson said that detectives still considered the Beautiful singer as a victim and not a suspect until the final hour before they had to release the two brothers who were arrested in connection with the case. If the brothers were charged, Smollett would still be seen as the victim.

“I refused to characterize Jussie Smollett as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson said. “The 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody is when it changed.”

Abel and Ola Osundairo, the two brothers who have worked on “Empire”, became cooperating witnesses, Johnson revealed.

“We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them — to just tell the truth about what happened,” Johnson said. “And that’s what they decided to do.”

Jonhson shared that he and the detectives working on the case had some doubts about the actor’s story.

“There were some questions,” Johnson said. “There’s always questions when people are describing incidents to us.”

“What’s important for people to realize is, it’s not the Chicago Police saying he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, the witnesses that are saying this,” he said.

Johnson said that the key piece of evidence was a cancelled cheque signed by Smollett. The brothers said Smollett “paid them $3,500 with a cheque … to carry out this incident.”

Johnson said that the decision to use a noose in the attack was offensive. Smollett had claimed that two men threw a rope around his neck during the alleged attack.

“The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I’m acutely aware of that,” he said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary.

“I want people to understand that (filing a false police report) is a damaging thing to a city and to a police department. It’s my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight.”

Smollett is due to appear in court again March 14."

King revealed her email on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night after Watters' gaff.

He was co-hosting The Five with Perino on Thursday when he mistakenly tried to both insult King and compliment her for her interview with R. Kelly.

'Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,' he said, referencing Robin Roberts' ABC interview with Jussie Smollett before he was arrested for allegedly staging a hoax attack and reporting it to the police.

Gayle King revealed on Thursday night that she emailed Fox News host Dana Perino (right) to say thank you for correcting Jesse Watters when he confused her with Robin Roberts

Perino nervously interjected: 'That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.'

Watters put his head in one hand and said: 'I knew that.' Later in the show, he held up a whiteboard apologizing to both King and Roberts.

During her appearance on Colbert, King said she did not watch the show but that friends told her about Watters' mistake.

'I normally don't watch Fox News so I was sent this. I emailed Dana, who I don't know, and said: ""Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I, it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know we're two different people and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike.""

'Yes I did, I said that to her,' King said.

Fox News host Jesse Watters was trying to praise Gayle King for her R. Kelly interview this week - but mistook her for Robin Roberts instead

Watters later held up a whiteboard on the show that read: 'I'm sorry Gayle + Robin' (pictured)

Perino replied to her email by saying it was 'nice to meet her', she revealed.

'We had a little joke about it and I hope to meet her one day because that was very nice of her to do,' King said.

Referring to Watters, she said: 'The guy just said like, ""Robin Roberts, Gayle King."" I just though, ""OK dude, all right. It's OK.""

She also revealed that before she and Kelly sat down in front of the CBS camera crew, she went to his apartment in Trump Tower Chicago to meet him.

Roberts' interview with Smollett aired just two days before he was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report. She called it one of the 'most challenging' interviews she's ever done

King has received high praise for keeping her cool while interviewing Kelly for CBS Morning this week as he lashed out over her questions

He was dressed in sweatpants and told her that he was going to change into a suit.

King said she wanted to put him at ease.

She also explained why she kept her cool when Kelly erupted in front of her, saying that she did not him to storm out of the interview.

'When I see Robert getting really upset and he stands up and he gets really upset, my initial reaction is ""please God please don't leave, please don't leave.""

'Because I really thought, we've seen him storm out of interviews before and I thought he was going to do that. And I thought, ""What can I do to save this interview?""

'So I sat there quietly, made eye contact with him. I thought, the minute I walk up there and say ""calm down"", it'll make it even worse.'

Her full interview with Kelly will be shown on CBS on Friday at 8pm EST."

Because of that, even though people are skeptical of Jussie Smollet‘s alleged attack on Jan. 29, there were also some side-eyes for the police force after countless leaks resulting in tons of misreporting. Now the department is investigating itself.

Chicago police said they were “conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously” to the media, according to NBC News. “[N]o alleged leakers have been identified so far,” NBC News reported. “[Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi] says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.”

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case. Originally, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone, but he did give his phone records. Then the FBI reportedly said the Chicago police “overstated” their Smollett case.

Plus, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson appears to love the media. From Don Lemon to press conferences he has done more chats with the press than Smollett. Back on Feb. 25, he flew all the way to “Good Morning America” to talk with Robin Roberts.

On this issue of the Chicago police not being trusted by many, especially in the Black community, Johnson replied, “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary … [Filing a false report] is a dangerous thing to do to a city and to a police department. Something like this can be really damaging. We made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations … I just hope people don’t judge other people that are victims of these types of crimes.”

In case you missed it, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” their case. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reports, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter. Here is a copy of the Jan. 22 that was sent to Fox Studios:

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson maintains Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.’” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.’” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence and was released on $100,000 bond. He has not talked to the media since his Feb. 14 “Good Morning America” interview.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

According to CBS Chicago, dozens of workers were terminated for looking at the actor’s medical records when he landed in the emergency room. It was right after he said two men attacked him, an incident for which he was later accused of lying about and staging himself.

One nurse already confirmed that she was let go on Tuesday, Feb. 26, but she claims to have only scrolled past Smollett’s medical chart when gathering information on another patient. That worker also said she has a strong belief that others were terminated for the same reason and calls the whole thing a misunderstanding.

The worker said she was never given a chance to explain herself before she was fired and was escorted out of the building right away.

Smollett was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 29 after saying two men beat him up while he was walking to a Subway restaurant in his neighborhood. Besides striking the actor, who’s gay and Black, he claimed the two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, put a noose around his neck and poured a liquid substance on him.

Police later arrested and spoke to two brothers from Nigeria who said Smollett paid them $3,500 to attack him, and the “Empire” star is now facing felony disorderly conduct charges.

On Feb. 21 Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department blasted the 36-year-old at a news conference for allegedly staging the attack.

“Why would anyone, especially an African-American, use a noose to further his public profile?” he asked.

The exact reason why Smollett may have staged the attack is still unknown, but some reports stated he was upset about his current salary on “Empire,” which, according to TMZ, the show’s producers said they have no cause to believe. TMZ reported that the actor is believed to have been getting $125,000 per episode.

At this time, there’s no further information about the hospital workers, because a spokesperson for Northwestern Memorial said it’s against policy to give employment status.

Smollett is due back in court on March 14."

Chicago police have launched an internal investigation into how information was being leaked during the department's investigation of a reported hate crime incident involving actor Jussie Smollett.

The agency is now saying that some information given to media by anonymous sources was ""inaccurate"" at times.

""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" chief communications officer Rocco Alioto told The Advocate in a statement. ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

The chief of detectives for CPD's Area Central, Edward Wodnicki, launched the probe after charges were formally filed against Smollett just last month. Smollett has been charged with a felony for filing a false report and police believe he staged the entire attack.

No leaker has been identified, and the police spokesperson says it will be hard to identify the source due to so many agencies being involved in the investigation.

Smollett is scheduled to appear before a judge later this month and still maintains his innocence regarding charges filed, even as public opinion of his case has swayed from support to condemnation.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence,"" Smollett's team told reporters after a press conference held by Chicago police that communicated they believe he is guilty.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for “destroying” his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning.” He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, “How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can’t work?”

ADVERTISEMENT

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had “zero” relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a “sex cult.”

Experts said Kelly’s appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That’s why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,” said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said … (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but “historically it’s a bad idea,” Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly’s case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

“A lot of the public already thinks he’s guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star “may not know all the evidence against him.”

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she’s 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman’s claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview — but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script.”

“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.

On Wednesday’s broadcast, Kelly’s emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I’m fighting for my (expletive) life.”

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music.”

“I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can’t do it” because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don’t want to believe it.”

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn’t come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly’s finances were “a mess.”

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — also are set to air. Savage’s parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day."

“An internal investigation has been opened,” the Windy City’ cops’ Sgt. Rocco Alioto confirmed to Deadline on Friday.

That examination of vulnerabilities comes as the $100,000 bailed out Smollett is expected back in court later this month in a matter that could see him behind bars for up to three years if found guilty.

There is no doubt that tips and teasers were being dribbled out to the media constantly and speculation running rapid at times, as detectives started looking closer at what had initially be called a “potential hate crime.”

Amid sharp elbowed city politics and a new mayor, the newly launched CPD internal investigation also comes as several employees at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago were pink slipped recently for accessing the Empire actor’s hospital records. Smollett went to the hospital briefly after the alleged beating in the early hours of January 29 and being dosed with a chemical that turned out to be bleach.

Written out of the final episodes of the now wrapped fifth season of Empire, the professional fate of the actor looks to be innately connected to court proceedings. However, fans of the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong created hip hop drama will get to see Smollett soon. Empire is back for the second half of its latest season on March 13 – though people may be watching for more than the drama of the Lyon clan.

After Smollett was arrested on February 21, Chicago prosecutors read out in court a lengthy series of text messages between Smollett and brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo that painted a picture of a clearly pre-planned attack. The texts included preparing money to buy supplies, buying drugs, setting up meetings and ensuring that MAGA hats and chants were part of the assault.

Oddly, the case presented in court offered little on what had been the Chicago PD’s primary motive of Smollett’s potentially disgraceful actions.

As Smollett sat in an isolated cell awaiting his initial court appearance, Chicago Police stepped in front of the cameras on the morning of his arrest for what became a damning press conference. Highlighted by a openly “pissed”-off Superintendent Eddie Johnson, the police claimed Smollett “orchestrated this crime” and the attack last month to “promote his career” and get a pay raise by taking “advantage of the pain and anger of racism.”

There was actually little mention of such a pay raise in the courtroom that afternoon. Smollett is paid $100,000 an episode on Empire. Various sources have denied that Smollett, who was insisted on his innocence since posting bail, was seriously seeking a change in his compensation status."

Good Morning Britain weatherman Alex Beresford emerged from the background on Tuesday morning as John Apter, chair of the of the Police Federation, an association representing law enforcement in England and Wales, said more punishment will solve the country’s issue with knife crimes.

“My argument, build more prisons,” Apter said during “Good Morning Britain,” hosted by Piers Morgan. “We need to have a consequence,” Apter added.

At that point in the broadcast, a voice emerged from the background. Beresford then spoke up.

“I’ve grown up in some of these communities that you guys are talking about and prison — it’s not a deterrent,” Beresford interjected from his chair on the set.

“It won’t change anything and that’s the key thing,” Beresford said.

The program tweeted out the exchange from its own Twitter account and viewers and fans gave Beresford a social media high five for speaking up on an issue that apparently mirrors debate taking place in the United States. The TV program later posted a longer video from Beresford in which he explains why he had to interject. During the explanation, Beresford made reference to “stop and search,” the United Kingdom equivalent of “stop and frisk.” The controversial measure that once was policy in New York City gave law enforcement the right to stop anyone who they deemed suspicious.

“The reason I really felt that I had to interrupt in the debate around knife crime today was because I sat there, in a way actually getting enraged because it’s quite hard for me as a mixed-race person that has grown up in some of the areas that these boys come from just to sit back and say nothing,” he said. “It’s easy to point the finger when you’ve not actually lived that life or had experience with what it’s like to be in that environment … You can’t hide from the statistics and we do know that it’s a problem in the Black community, especially, just throwing stop-and-search out there as a way to kind of fix all is not the answer.”

On Wednesday, the day after the exchange, Beresford posted a photo of himself on Twitter in workout gear and thanked the public for backing him up.

“Off to the gym to burn off some steam,” he posted. “Thanks for all your kind messages. It really means a lot.”

It also noted that Blacks and Hispanics are behind the state average in high school graduation rates, which are 75 percent for blacks and 80.7 percent for Hispanics. The statewide graduation rate is 85.4 percent.

The Fox News host Jesse Watters confused the two black journalists on Wednesday, praising King for “redeeming herself” for an interview that Roberts had done.

Fox News’ Jesse Watters praised King on a Wednesday episode of “The Five” for “totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco.”

But his cohost Dana Perino quickly stepped in to correct him, saying King had not conducted a recent, highly criticised interview with the actor Jussie Smollett; Roberts had.

“Oh, I knew that,” Watters responded before apologizing for the mistake.

Watters had been referring to Roberts’ interview with Smollett on February 12, just days before Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report about an attack the Chicago police believe he staged.

“Oh my gosh, Stephen. I couldn’t believe this,” King said. “I just thought, OK. That’s all right, dude. That’s OK.'”

King said she emailed Perino to thank her for standing up for her on-air – and to request she convey a message to her colleagues at Fox News.

“I got her email and said: ‘Hi, i just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people.

According to CBS Chicago, dozens of workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Smollett was treated after the incident, have been terminated. These employees, which included nurses and other staffers, were fired for improperly reviewing Smollett’s medical records, sources say.

One nurse told CBS that she was fired on the spot at the end of her shift last week. Afterwards she was escorted from the hospital and never was able to provide an explanation for what had occured. According to her, she never actually looked at Smollett's chart but only scrolled past it in search of someone else.

The hospital did not respond to the reports.

In addition, the Chicago police department has launched an internal investigation spurred by the numerous alleged leaks, attributed to the department over the span of the investigation. “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Sergeant Rocco Alioto of the department told ET in a statement. “As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

The case is currently being treated as a hoax, and Smollet has been charged for filing a false report. The singer-actor maintains his innocence and is out on a $100,000 bail, presumably mounting his defense. He has also been cut from episodes of Empire, a show on which he stars, as a result of the scandal. In a recent interview on Good Morning America, the police department said they have more evidence that has yet to be revealed, but that Smollett retains the presumption of innocence.

The always questionable Chicago Police Department is in the hot seat now that they’ve launched an internal investigation surrounding leaks in the Jussie Smollett case.

Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the CPD, confirmed with ABC News that the probe was launched last month “during the interrogation of the brothers when information leaked out,” referring to the two Osundairo brothers who investigators claim staged Smollet’s hate crime attack in January.

Investigators are trying to determine who anonymously leaked important info about the case to the press.

“I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,” Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday. “These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.”

In February, the CPD accused Jussie of staging his attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He now faces one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report which could carry a three years in prison sentence plus fines."

Free, easy to use, and available 24/7/365, the internet’s user-generated encyclopedia is convenient and, more often than not, correct. Since Wikipedia’s humble beginnings as an unreliable work-in-progress, it has amassed a loyal legion of fans, enabling it to grow and expand both its subject matter and accuracy many times over.

This is due in large part to a dedicated contingency of volunteers who, along with bots, constantly comb new entries and edits to confirm their veracity and conformity to Wikipedia’s sensible, highly nuanced standards.

Within this massive endeavor to make Wikipedia as reliable as possible lies the problem: For a site to maintain its immunity under the Communications Decency Act, it must function as a platform, not a publisher. A finding that the world’s largest free encyclopedia is a publisher would puncture its immunity and open it to suit. Wikipedia’s undeniably good-faith effort to empower volunteers to consistently and constantly purge it of inaccurate, malicious, defamatory posts and edits, as well as create new pages and update existing ones, gives rise to serious questions about which category it belongs to.

The fact that editors, even those who have risen to the level of administrators (also called admins, and system operators or sysops), are volunteers may be irrelevant, for Wikipedia utilizes role-based access control to determine who can perform which tasks.

Wikipedia, in the end, controls the editors and can give or take away their access as it sees fit.

In the fall of 2018, a Google search of Andrew Gillum, then the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida showed why that mattered.

At the time, the preview box on the results, which pulled content from Wikipedia, incorrectly said that Gillum had died in Miami the day before. A closer look at the history of Gillum’s Wikipedia page over the following days revealed the tracks of dozens of edits, several deemed “vandalism” by Wikipedia editors, a few with clearly false, potentially defamatory statements.

One edit said Gillum was “a liar who has done nothing in Tallahassee for the crime rate”; another, nearly a month before the election said he had “lost to Ron DeSantis”; one of the more clever edits, by the tellingly named editor “gohomegillum,” replaced the embedded link to his official website with an anti-Gillum page. Eventually, an administrator gave the page temporary “protected” status based on “persistent vandalism.”

The edit history of Gillum’s page is hardly unique. The back-and-forth on pages is common enough to have earned the nickname “edit wars.” A rather amusing Wikipedia page catalogues the “lamest edit wars,” such as the debate over whether Caesar salad was named for Julius or Cardini. Wikipedia frowns on this practice, preferring editors to seek consensus or even dispute resolution, and warns that “[u]sers who engage in edit warring risk being blocked or even banned.” This is just another way Wikipedia controls edits on its site.

Edits vary broadly, but even a casual observer can see patterns. The pages of high-profile or controversial individuals and organizations tend to be far more frequently edited and re-edited than those of little public interest, such as people who are deceased or have fallen out of the news; if someone or something is thrust into the spotlight, like by a major scandal, their page explodes with edits.

Political and controversial subjects are frequently targeted. Prior to actor Jussie Smollett reporting a hate crime against him that police later accused him of fabricating, his page received perhaps as many as a few dozen edits per month. From Jan. 30, the date on which the alleged hate crime was reported, until Feb. 26, his page was edited more than 800 times. The page of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), darling on the left and villain on the right, whose name is constantly in the news, has been edited more than 1,000 times since she won the seat in November.

Each time an edit appears on Wikipedia, like the one referring to Cortez as “prone to verbal gaffes, leading some to speculate that she is not well-versed on the issues,” a bot, admin or editor will review it. If the content of an edit passes muster, the language may nevertheless be cleaned up or corrected for better readability or clarity; if it doesn’t, the revision will be undone and, often, the editor will explain their reasoning for undoing it.

In the prior example, the editor who undid the change wrote, “You’ve seen people object and now you’re editing without consensus to add a dedicated criticism section on a [sic] active congressmember. Please stop your POV [point of view] editing efforts here and now.” All edits are to conform with Wikipedia’s standards.

Often edits are updated or deleted within minutes. But some linger. In 2005, the New York Times reported on the case of John Seigenthaler Sr., who was stunned to learn that his Wikipedia page had for months included the libelous statement that he “was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John and his brother Bobby.”

Efforts to identify the anonymous editor who libeled him proved fruitless and, with no other options for relief, Seigenthaler, now deceased, went public with his experience, penning an article in which he concluded, “that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool.”

Today, most understand the law regarding defamatory statements on Wikipedia to be much the same as it was when Seigenthaler found only roadblocks when he sought relief: that Wikipedia, like social media sites, is immune from suit for statements made by others on its pages thanks to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

But Wikipedia is not in quite the same position as the Twitters and Instagrams of the world, for it is not merely a passive platform essentially functioning as a pass-through for others’ statements; Wikipedia, through staff, bots and volunteers it authorizes, plays an active role in content creation and augmentation.

The fact that its motivation for doing so may be noble, and it does appear to be driven solely by the overarching goal of being as fair and accurate as possible, does not change the fact that a court could find that Wikipedia has taken on such an active role that it has become what it has long resisted and denied being: a publisher. If so, then the same reasoning that exposed Backpage.com to liability could apply to Wikipedia.

For many years, regulators and lawmakers struggled with how to grapple with the illegal activity on Backpage.com, which was well known as a place where prostitution thrived, including of trafficked children. Again and again, victims’ suits against Backpage.com were dismissed on the grounds that the site was immune under the Communications Decency Act. It wasn’t until evidence piled up, demonstrating that Backpage.com had an active role creating the sex ads, that the site and its founders were hauled before a grand jury and charged with facilitating prostitution, among other crimes, on the grounds that Backpage.com was a publisher.

How is this different from Wikipedia’s role creating and altering content on its site? Clearly, the free online encyclopedia is not involved in anything approaching the evil, insidious scourge of the child sex trade, but when the logic that exposed Backpage to liability is applied to Wikipedia, is it not also a publisher? If one of its admins makes a mistake that libels someone, why is Wikipedia immune, while a media outlet whose intern makes the same mistake could be subject to suit?

Many will say that Wikipedia, which is operated by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation, is a force of good in this world—and they’re not wrong. It is also the same site credited with, however unintentionally, putting the beloved 244-year-old Encyclopedia Britannica out of business in 2012. It is also part of the conglomerate of pages that has helped strangle the newspaper industry onto life support.

And it isn’t necessarily hurting for cash, either. According to Charity Navigator, which gives Wikimedia Foundation an extremely high rating, it had nearly $90 million of revenue in FY2017, and has $113 million of assets. To put these sums in perspective, newspaper conglomerate Digital First Media posted nearly $160 million in profits that year. Digital First Media operates 97 newspapers, including the Denver Post. Wikipedia is just one site.

Even as more and more of us rely on crowd-sourced information on the internet, like that on Wikipedia, thanks to the current understanding of the Communications Decency Act, holding someone accountable for harms caused online can prove elusive, if not impossible.

Meanwhile, internet companies rake in profits and donations with such impunity that Georgetown University law professor Rebecca Tushnet referred to them as having “power without responsibility” in a frequently-cited paper.

Perhaps the time has come to take some of that power back.

In recent years, a growing chorus of voices have wondered whether allowing unfettered expression on the internet without recourse for victims who are defamed, have their privacy invaded, or worse, is in the public interest, whether it is in our best interest to update Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or for courts to reinterpret it, to allow companies to be held accountable for at least some of the conduct on their sites.

The websites argue that exposing them to any liability for statements on their sites would have a stifling effect on the internet, a massive industry that contributes verily to the economy.

Of course, this is their argument; these companies don’t want to be sued. It is possible to tailor any update to the law to allow for liability in only very narrow circumstances, to ensure suits against sites are only possible in the most exceptional circumstances.

When a website, such as Wikipedia or Backpage.com, takes an active role in creating, editing or otherwise augmenting content, should it not be liable for its own mistakes and transgressions, as well as those of admins and editors who derive their power from the site itself?"

The announcement of the internal investigation came on the same day as a report from CBS 2 Chicago which claimed that many workers and nurses at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago may have been fired for inappropriately accessing Smollett’s medical records.

The 36-year-old actor was treated at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital after allegedly being attacked in January.

“Any time you get law enforcement drip-drip-drip leaks, that to me is a telltale sign that something else is going on here,” Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos said while on CNN. “I haven’t seen anything except leaks according to law enforcement sources. To me, that screams out somebody is trying to manipulate something.”

In February, Chicago Police Sup. Eddie Johnson said the Empire actor “still has the presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.”

Johnson told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts that, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Johnson said that detectives still considered the Beautiful singer as a victim and not a suspect until the final hour before they had to release the two brothers who were arrested in connection with the case. If the brothers were charged, Smollett would still be seen as the victim.

“We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them — to just tell the truth about what happened,” Johnson said. “And that’s what they decided to do.”

Jonhson shared that he and the detectives working on the case had some doubts about the actor’s story.

“There were some questions,” Johnson said. “There’s always questions when people are describing incidents to us.”

“What’s important for people to realize is, it’s not the Chicago Police saying he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, the witnesses that are saying this,” he said.

Johnson said that the key piece of evidence was a cancelled cheque signed by Smollett. The brothers said Smollett “paid them $3,500 with a cheque … to carry out this incident.”

Johnson said that the decision to use a noose in the attack was offensive. Smollett had claimed that two men threw a rope around his neck during the alleged attack.

“The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I’m acutely aware of that,” he said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary.

“I want people to understand that (filing a false police report) is a damaging thing to a city and to a police department. It’s my responsibility to make sure the record gets set straight.”

Smollett is due to appear in court again March 14.

“Stand-your-ground” laws establish the rights of civilians to use their firearms when they feel threatened, and critics have argued that such legislation can be seen as a right to kill and often targets people of color.

Arkansas Sen. Stephanie Flowers, a Democrat from Pine Bluff, told her white colleagues in the state Senate that their paths just are not the same as hers when it comes to such legislation and with the law in general. She made the comments at the state capitol in Little Rock.

“My son doesn’t walk the same path as yours do so this debate deserves more time,” said Flowers, voice rising and hands gesturing. “When you bring up crap like this it offends me.”

For 10 years, lawmakers have tried to pass a “stand-your-ground” law for the state and for 10 years, they have not been successful.

As Flowers tried to explain why the state Senate needed more discussion on the proposed bill, not less, one lawmaker tried to step in and silence her.

“Senator, you need to stop,” Arkansas Sen. Alan Clark, a Republican from Lonsdale, Ark., told Flowers.

Clark heads the state Senate Judiciary Committee.

“No, I don’t,” Flowers said.

“Yes you do,” replied Clark.

“No the hell I don’t,” Flowers shot back. “What are you going to do, shoot me?”

Flowers was the only legislator of color present

In the end, the proposed bill failed. The Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republicans, rejected the measure 4-3.

Arkansas is one of three states in the South where someone is required to retreat before using deadly force, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other Southern states with such a requirement are Maryland and Virginia.

At least 25 states have “stand-your-ground’ laws, according to the organization based in Washington.

Jussie Smollett

Police in Chicago have opened an internal investigation into the Jussie Smollett case, after ""inaccurate"" information about the Empire star's attack was leaked.

Smollett claimed he was the victim of a hate crime outside his Chicago apartment in January, telling police two white men beat him up and tied a noose around his neck while yelling homophobic and racial slurs.

Following a lengthy investigation by Chicago police, the actor is now facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in the hope the hoax would boost his career and salary. It's claimed he paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him - allegations Smollett has strenuously denied.

During the investigation, numerous pieces of information made their way into the media, and it's these leaks that have prompted the Chicago P.D.'s new investigation.

""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" a spokesperson for the force said in a statement. ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

Smollett is next due in court on March 14 to face the disorderly conduct felony charge.

Following his arrest, Smollett posted bail and returned to the set of hit TV show Empire, where he reportedly apologized to his co-stars and the crew and insisted he was innocent.

However, executive producers of the show, including co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, decided to cut his character from the last episodes of season five while they await the next developments in the criminal process."

As the world decides on whether or not it should stick by Jussie Smollett‘s side, Vivica A. Fox is taking a different approach to gain some perspective on if her Empire fam could have staged his own attack back in January.

After reports came out that Jussie was beaten, purportedly by MAGA supporters, the Chicago Police Department followed up by accusing the actor of setting up the beat down himself—because he was unhappy with his Empire pay.

Now, on a special episode of Face The Truth, Vivica—who guest stars as Cookie Lyon’s older sister on the hit series—spoke with a body language expert who examined Jussie’s recent ABC interview with Robin Roberts. In regard to Jussie’s lack of eye contact, expert Tonya Reiman says…

“Typically when you are remembering a story what you would do instead of looking side to side is look up to visualize that story.”

Reiman also noticed Jussie cried after giving his account of what happened…

“He cried at a moment where the story had already been told…when someone is telling you about the most dramatic part of the story that’s typically when they emote,” she said.

Overall, Reiman does think Jussie suffered through SOMETHING…

“He, in my opinion, might have suffered through something, I don’t think he suffered through the story he gave us.” Reiman summarizes. “There were too many red flags for me to think this story was 100% accurate.”

As for Vivica, she says she adores her costar but GOTS to know what went down.

“I’ve known Jussie since he was a little boy…when this story came out I was absolutely shocked, saddened, horrified by it,” she said. “What I do hope, is that when all the evidence and everything comes out that we get closure. I want to support him. I absolutely adore him. I’ve never known him to be a deceptive person, so my prayers are with his family but more than anything else I just want the truth to come out to what really did happen and why.”

On Thursday, they thought Robin Roberts and Gayle King were the same person. Well, Ms. King had a classy clap back.

While appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” she was asked about the mix up from the trifling Jesse Watters. Dana Parino corrected him, which made King email her.

“It was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,” Oprah’s BFF explained she wrote in the email. She also said she asked Parino to remind the folks at Fox News “that all Black people do not look alike.” Watch below:

On Thursday, while talking about King’s polished and professional interview with R. Kelly, — something Fox knows nothing about — Watters said, “Hats off to Gayle King, for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.”

Perino awkwardly replied, “That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.”

Trying to clean it up, Watters said, “I knew that. Sorry for Robin Roberts out there.”

Watters apologized later in the show with a note on a whiteboard, writing, “I’m sorry Gayle + Robin.”

In case you missed it, Kelly got extremely emotional when interviewed by King. The disgraced singer went ballistic and screamed, “Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through. … Quit playing! I didn’t do this stuff!

Fox News mixing up Black people is normal for the conservative network. Back when the Queen of Soul died on August 16, 2018, every network on the planet was covering her death, but Fox News posted a photo of Patti LaBelle instead. See the photo below with Patti LaBelle in the corner:

Fox did issue a soulless apology.

“We sincerely apologize to Aretha Franklin’s family and friends,” a statement said. “Our intention was to honor the icon using a secondary image of her performing with Patti LaBelle in the full screen graphic, but the image of Ms. Franklin was obscured in that process, which we deeply regret.”

Fox News is trash.

Stephenson was also wanted in the brutal stabbing murder of 40-year-old Natina Kiah, according to police spokesperson Kristen Metzger that reportedly happened on Wednesday.

The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington responded to a welfare check call and found Kiah and her cat dead from stab wounds at a residence. The woman and her cat were pronounced dead at the scene.

“My baby’s gone, but I feel so happy and so blessed that they got him,” said Kiah’s mother, Jennifer Wallace, at her family’s home in Temple Hills, Maryland.

“That was my only child,” she added. “He took it away from me. He took it away from me, but he will not take my joy.”

“Why?” said Kiah’s daughter Timeia Clark, as she cried. “My mom’s not going to be there for my graduation or my prom. Just why? Why did they have to do it?”

“That was senseless, brutalist murder,” said Timothy Clark, the father of Kiah’s children, according to NBC Washington. “He just left four young women without a mother.”

Police were responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle on Thursday when they arrested Stephenson.

Stephenson reportedly has been on the lam since 2014. He was accused of asphyxiating DeJesus, and her chihuahua on October 17, 2014 in an apartment she shared with the suspect in Newark, New Jersey.

A federal arrest warrant was issued on September 8, 2017, by the United States District Court of New Jersey. Stephenson was charged with homicide. The FBI believed he left the area to avoid prosecution.

Stephenson was added to the Most Wanted list last October and $100,000 reward was offered for information on Stephenson."

He faces 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office confirmed to WLS-TV in Chicago.

""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time ... there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" the indictment said, according to WBBM-TV in Chicago.

Smollett came under scrutiny over the past several weeks after he told police two men attacked him while yelling racial slurs and saying this is ""MAGA country"" -- a reference to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan. The actor-singer was hospitalized with cuts and bruises after he said the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and put a noose around his neck.

But after several weeks of investigation, Chicago police said Smollett staged the attack.

The grand jury returned two indictments for Smollett, one stemming from his initial report of the attack and another from a second interview he gave police. Each charge carries a sentence of up to four years of probation.

Meanwhile, Chicago police want to know who leaked information about the department's investigation into Smollett to the media.

The internal investigation is looking at the interrogation of two brothers, who police said were paid by Smollett to stage a fake attack on him to garner sympathy and fame. Police said Abel Osundairo and Ola Osundairo were paid $3,500 via personal check with a memo line that reads ""personal training.""

Details of the police questioning were leaked to the media at some point. No alleged leakers have been identified, and no Chicago police officers have been disciplined. State police, prosecutors and federal agents all the way to court clerk's staff had access to the details of the case, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

""I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time, and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,"" Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday evening. ""These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.""

Police had obtained a search warrant that led to the check and have text messages between Smollett and the brothers. Smollett was initially charged with a single count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report and was arrested. He pleaded not guilty. He is free on $100,000 bail."

Dozens of employees at Northwestern Hospital have been terminated for allegedly accessing Jussie Smollett’s medical records.

Smollett was taken to the Chicago medical facility following his alleged attack by two men back in January.

The Empire actor, who is currently out on bail, has since been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false report, a felony. Smollett’s legal team, however, told ESSENCE in a statement that they will “mount an aggressive defense.”

The hospital employees are alleged to have gained access to Smollett’s medical chart after Chicago police and prosecutors claimed the actor staged his January 29 attack, CBS2 Chicago reports.

One of the nurses who was fired is calling the incident a misunderstanding and claims that she simply glanced at the records while looking for another patient’s information.

She is now appealing the termination and says many other hospital workers may have been let go for the same reason.

During an interview with Good Morning America last month, Smollett pushed back against critics who have accused him of lying about the assault.

“I’m pissed off. It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it,’ ’cause it’s the truth,” Smollett told GMA. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’”"

The CBS This Morning co-anchor said when she went to interview the 52-year-old disgraced singer, she knew he wasn’t going to say, “You know Gayle, you’re right. I’ve done terrible things. I think we were witnessing the self-destruction of a man having a breakdown and that’s never a good thing to see.”

Gayle said she “feels his pain, his anger” but, she said, “he also knows what he’s done.”

Host Stephen also pointed to one of the notable comments from after the R.

His co-host Dana Perino pointed out it wasn’t King who interviewed Smollett, it was Roberts.

Gayle told Stephen she sent an email to Dana to thank her and said it was a “great compliment” to be mistaken for Roberts. “Thank you for letting him know we’re two different people and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike?”

Chicago police said they were “conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously” to the media, according to NBC News. “[N]o alleged leakers have been identified so far,” NBC News reported. “[Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi] says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.”

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case. Originally, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone, but he did give his phone records. Then the FBI reportedly said the Chicago police “overstated” their Smollett case.

Plus, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson appears to love the media. From Don Lemon to press conferences he has done more chats with the press than Smollett. Back on Feb. 25, he flew all the way to “Good Morning America” to talk with Robin Roberts.

On this issue of the Chicago police not being trusted by many, especially in the Black community, Johnson replied, “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary … [Filing a false report] is a dangerous thing to do to a city and to a police department. Something like this can be really damaging. We made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations … I just hope people don’t judge other people that are victims of these types of crimes.”

In case you missed it, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” their case. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reports, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter. Here is a copy of the Jan. 22 that was sent to Fox Studios:

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson maintains Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence and was released on $100,000 bond. He has not talked to the media since his Feb. 14 “Good Morning America” interview.

Ilhan Omar, a freshman Minnesota Democrat, that some have characterized as anti-Semitic. However, Omar is not here for it and reminded McCain of her father’s undeniable racist past.

Without even directly tweeting her, Omar retweeted a post from The Intercept’s Mehdi Hasan, which read, “Meghan’s late father literally sang ‘bomb bomb bomb Iran’ and insisted on referring to his Vietnamese captors as ‘gooks’. He also, lest we forget, gave the world Sarah Palin. So a little less faux outrage over a former refugee-turned-freshman-representative pls.”

McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, said as recently as 2000 that, “I hate gooks, I will hate them all my life.” That same year, he advocated for keeping the Confederate flag flying atop the South Carolina statehouse. Eight later, he would run for president and become the Republican nominee. We also can’t forget the senator was a staunch opponent of the national Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Even after President Ronald Reagan finally decided to approve the bill for MLK Day, McCain voted against it.

Sounds like Meghan needs a refresher.

“With the rise of anti-Semitism in this country, is it more important to defend party politics, or is it more important to defend anti-Semitism?” McCain asked on “The View” Thursday. “We can have conversations all day long about how you feel about Palestinian politics, Israeli politics, how you feel about (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. … I just present this question, which may be an uncomfortable one: If what Ilhan Omar has been saying for the past few weeks were said by a white Republican male, how would you be reacting to it right now?”

McCain said that she doesn’t need Jewish blood relatives to feel strongly about anti-Semitism.

“It is very dangerous, very dangerous and I think we collectively as Americans on both sides, what Ilhan Omar is saying is very scary to me,” she said. “It’s very scary to a lot of people and I don’t think you have to be Jewish to recognize that.”

The House approved a resolution on Thursday condemning hate speech, in an indirect condemnation of Omar, Politico reported.

Democrats fought each other about exactly what the resolution would say. It started off as a four-page document that condemned anti-Semitism on Monday and expanded by Thursday to include a blanket statement against all forms of bigotry.

McCain had a different response in January after GOP Iowa Rep. Steve King defended white supremacy in a New York Times interview.

“I think this is the problem with identity politics in the country. When you broad-stroke everyone,” the 34-year-old rambled. “All Black people think one thing. All Hispanics think one thing. All Republicans think one thing. That’s how we got ourselves into this mess.” She then added, “Please don’t paint me, just because I’m for border security, that I somehow am racist in some way or another — ’cause I don’t think that’s fair!”

King was discovered recently promoting white nationalism on Twitter—just the latest incident in a long history of defending white supremacy. He quote-tweeted Canadian white nationalist Faith Goldy on March 1, the Huffington Post reported.

Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, first found herself in the middle of a firestorm over anti-Semitism on Feb. 12. She sparked outrage for her comment to a tweet about how she and Michigan’s Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib—the other Muslim woman member of Congress—could face consequences for criticizing Israel.

She tweeted: “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” a hip-hop reference to $100 bills. When asked whom she thought was paying lawmakers, she replied: “AIPAC!” a pro-Israel lobby group.

Kelly went viral, she’s been getting a lot of phone calls—from family, friends including Oprah Winfrey, and even . . . Elton John?

“In the greenroom, Elton John called me,” the CBS This Morning co-host told Stephen Colbert during a Late Show appearance Thursday night. “He goes, ‘Gayle, it’s Elton here.’ I went, ‘Elton John? Hi, Elton!’ He was calling to talk about the R. Kelly interview. I thought that was so nice!”

Given how explosive the interview was, it’s not hard to guess why droves of people have been calling. King has received widespread praise for her unshakable composure in the face of an increasingly emotional R. Kelly—who eventually stood over her, screaming and gesticulating wildly. When asked how she managed to keep her cool, King said her main concern when Kelly got out of his seat was that he was going to storm out of the interview—as, she noted, he has done with others in the past.

“I was thinking, ‘I’m not done with my questions; what can I do to save this interview?’” she said. “So I decided if I sit there quietly, make eye contact with him—I thought the minute I walk up and say, if I stood up, like, ’Calm down’ . . . I figured that that would make it even worse. So I thought if I just sit there quietly, looking at him, he would know I’m not going anywhere, and I’ll just wait for you to finish whatever this is, and then you’ll sit back down in the seat. And he did that.”

King added that at no point did she believe Kelly would intentionally hurt her. “What I was worried about is that he was flailing, hitting his fists so violently—I was worried that he would accidentally hit me,” she said. “But I never thought that he wanted to hurt me in any way.” That said, she added, “And I don’t want to accidentally get hit either, guys—I didn’t want that.”

“If you could have seen the thought bubble, it would have been, ‘Ruh-roh—please sit back down. You’re looking a little crazy right now. Please sit back down,’” King concluded.

Kelly has long been followed by accusations of inappropriate behavior with under-aged women. In 2017, a report alleged that the singer was holding multiple women in a “cult.” Kelly has vehemently denied the accusations, but is currently in jail due to lapsed child-support payments. Last month, he was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Authorities in Detroit are also investigating Kelly in response to separate allegations of under-age sex that date back to 2001."

Gayle King isn’t new to this, she’s true to this.



The CBS This Morning host’s interview with Robert “R.” Kelly affirmed as much. Her calm, poised demeanor sitting in stark relief against Kelly’s emotional outbursts as she confronted him about years of sexual abuse allegations. Viewers applauded King’s work, as did many of her peers around the media industry, including Jesse Watters, a sturdy lump of self-tanner masquerading as a host at Fox News.

Watters offered kudos to King for her exclusive interview with Kelly, but in doing so, mistook her for A BC’s Robin Roberts.

On Thursday night, King chatted with the The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert about the mixup.

“Were you happy to hear that Fox News’ Jesse Watters gave you props for this interview after that Jussie Smollett interview you did?” Colbert asked.

King laughed before making it very clear that she doesn’t typically watch Fox News, but after hearing about the gaffe, reached out to Dana Perino via email to thank her for correcting Watters on air.

According to King, she told Perino:

Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I, it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people. And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?

King added she and Perino shared a “little joke” about the gaffe afterward.

Kelly and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a four-minute segment, the morning show dissected an Atlantic piece by Spencer Kornhaber titled “The Message in R. Kelly’s Meltdown: Explosive rage, statements of persecution, and an appeal to male viewers: The singer’s CBS interview about sexual-abuse allegations seemed familiar.”

The Friends ran the now-famous clip of CBS This Morning’s Gayle King sitting calmly while the R&B star flailed his hands and shouted obscenities at the camera over her shoulder.

Then they brought in an expert to discuss the perceived absurdities in The Atlantic’s comparison between the two famous sex-abuse deniers.

They ran a narrow excerpt from the Atlantic piece: “The substance of what the two men have been accused of differs vastly, but their responses—and the cultural scripts they draw upon—rhyme. Brett Kavanaugh shouted about Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations as being unfair given the life he’s lived, while Kelly argued that his previous acquittal meant the present allegations were also “unfair.”

F&F’s Steve Doocy then brought on Joe Concha, media reporter for The Hill, to explain why the sex-abuse denials cannot be compared. “I wish I had a Bible next to me,” Concha said. “Because then I would swear on it that when I read that, when I read that piece, I thought somehow that it was a farcical piece, like from some sort of comedy site.”

He then went on, “There is no way, Steve, that you could write that sentence, ‘The substance of what the two men have been accused of differs vastly’—yeah, ya think?”

Concha then went on to list Kelly’s previous crimes and misdemeanors, under which he grouped the singer’s marriage along with previous and current allegations of sexual abuse through the last 19 years. “In other words, these are real things,” Concha said.

“With Brett Kavanaugh, he was accused of things by three different women that nobody could corroborate,” he said. “And to say, by the way... that Brett Kavanaugh shouted about Christine Blasey Ford while Kelly argued... go back and play that tape. Does it look like Kelly is arguing, or does it look like Kelly is having a nervous breakdown on national television?”

“This is a joke, Steve,” he said. “I don’t know how else to put it.”

The two then watched a segment of Kavanaugh’s emotional testimony to compare the men’s intensity while denying claims brought about by women who say they were abused. “R. Kelly stood up and started crying and walking in circles,” Concha pointed out, praising King’s composure. “But Brett Kavanaugh doesn’t stand up and start screaming at Kamala Harris or Corey Booker or any of the Democrats during those confirmation hearings.”

Concha then goes on to point out that people also compared Jussie Smollett to Kavanaugh. “Let’s just compare everything to Brett Kavanaugh because Kavanaugh just offered up a passionate but composed defense of being accused of things where there is no evidence.”

Fox & Friends did not mention the actual claims by alleged victims in either case, or show the full context in which The Atlantic piece continued. “Boys-will-be-boys logic–whether about drunken tomfoolery or sexual conquest—play in both’s defense,” the Atlantic piece goes on to say. “Most strikingly, the force and fury of the tactics used by both men make the same dare. For those inclined to believe the accused, passion in the face of prosecution could read as innocence. For those who aren’t, it might look like a predator’s brutality coming out.”

The show followed up the women’s day segment with a short piece on why the American ISIS bride should never be allowed back into the country."

During her appearance on The Late Show Thursday night, the CBS This Morning host talked to Stephen Colbert about the awkward incident, in which Watters was attempting to praise King's recent interview with R. Kelly, who is facing 10 counts of sexual abuse charges.

During an episode of the Fox News talk show The Five, Watters said, ""Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco."" However, it was Roberts who interviewed Smollett on GMA last month about his alleged attack — not King.

After an awkward beat, Watters' co-host, Dana Perino, corrected him, quickly adding, ""That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.""

""I couldn't believe it,"" King told Colbert, laughing. ""So many people started sending this to me, because I normally don't watch Fox News, unless I'm just curious to see what's going on and what other people are thinking.""

King, 64, said she emailed Perino, 46, to thank her for correcting her colleague.

""So I emailed Dana, who I don't know, I got her email and I said, 'Hi, I just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I — it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we're two different people,'"" King recalled to Colbert. ""'And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike.'""

The crowd laughed and cheered, while Colbert joked, ""It's good to remind them every so often.""

King then explained that Perino wrote back and said it was nice to meet her. King even said that they ""had a little joke about it.""

Watters quickly apologized after being corrected on the air, and then later at the end of the show held up a small dry erase white board that read, ""I'm sorry Gayle + Robin.""

King has received accolades from journalists, family, friends and celebrities across the board on her powerful interview with Kelly. She revealed to Colbert that she even got a personal phone call from Elton John just before going onstage at The Late Show.

""In the green room, Elton John called me!"" King exclaimed. ""It was a 212 number that I didn't recognize, so I thought it was work… and he goes, 'Gayle, it's Elton here.' And I go, 'Elton John?! Hi, Elton!' And he was calling to talk about the R. Kelly interview. I thought that it was so nice that he called.""

Throughout the explosive interview, during which Kelly stood up and yelled that he was innocent, King remained calm. She told O: The Oprah Magazine that she was not scared, despite the intense situation.

""I was not scared. I never thought he was going to hit me,"" she said. ""After, Oprah and my kids Kirby and Will called me to ask if I was okay because it looked scary. But I was never worried he was going to hurt me. I was more worried that he was going to get up and leave.""

King continued, ""So what I was really thinking to myself was: I'm not done with this interview, so I'm going to let him have his moment. If I stood up even to comfort him, that could have been his invitation to say 'This is over.' So I didn't interrupt his anger and let him have that.""

Even though Kelly stood over King, screaming and crying, she said she ""just knew"" she was never in danger.

""I did worry at some points that he might accidentally hit me, because he was so angry that he was flailing,"" King explained. ""But I knew that I wasn't in any real danger. I just kept thinking 'Okay, Robert, go ahead' and that's what I said.""

The interview was Kelly's first since Chicago prosecutors charged him with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from alleged abuse that took place over 12 years. Prosecutors say they have evidence of Kelly allegedly engaged in sex acts with underage girls, including a video allegedly showing him with a 14-year-old girl.

Kelly insisted to King that he was innocent, saying he was being ""buried alive"" and ""assassinated.""

""I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive. But I'm alive,"" Kelly said as King asked him if he ever held women against their will.

""How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I've been through – oh right, now I just think I have to be monster, and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don't let them eat, don't let them out, unless they need some shoes down the street from their uncle!""

He stood up from his chair, yelling, ""Stop it. You all quit playing! Quit playing! I didn't do this stuff! This is not me! I'm fighting for my f—ing life! Y'all killing me with this s—! I gave you 30 years of my f—ing career!""

CBS will air the interview as a one-hour primetime special on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.

So yeah, the cops are basically investigating themselves, something that never looks kosher from the outside.

Reports TMZ:

Chicago PD tells us its Chief of Detectives opened the investigation out of concerns the force was leaking like a sieve. CPD adds there’s been a ton of “inaccurate” info in the media, and they want to know who’s putting it out there.

A police spokesman tells TMZ … “When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

And in semi-related news, “dozens” of workers were fried from a Chicago hospital after accessing Smollett’s records were leaked.

At this point, will we ever find out exactly what happened to Jussie Smollett?

(Reuters) - The Chicago Police Department has started an internal investigation into how information about an alleged hate crime attack against actor Jussie Smollett was anonymously leaked to journalists, police officials said.

Smollett, 36, a black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” was charged with lying to police last month after he said he was attacked in January by two masked men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs. Detectives investigated the incident as a hate crime but local news outlets cited police sources saying it was believed to be a hoax.

“I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Police Sergeant Rocco Alioto said in a statement on Thursday.

He said an internal investigation had begun as part of standard procedure for allegations of information leaks.

Smollett ignited a media firestorm by telling police two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump had struck him, put a noose round his neck and poured bleach over him during an assault outside his apartment on Jan. 29.

The actor was arrested on Feb. 21 and charged with filing a false police report after detectives said he staged the hoax hate crime attack to boost his fame because he was unhappy with his salary on the show. He was later released on bail.

The makers of “Empire,” 20th Century Fox Television, cut Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, from the final two episodes of the current season after his arrest, saying it wanted to avoid “further disruption” on its production set.

Smollett, who pleaded not guilty, faces up to three years in prison if convicted. His next court hearing is scheduled for March 14.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men’s help and made a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi says no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case."

The crime was described by Judge Ronald Hendricks as “disgraceful” and “appalling” during the hearing at the High Court in Mahikeng. In April 2017, the farmers reportedly hurled 15-year-old boy Matlhomola Mosweu off a moving truck, breaking his neck.

The men argued that they caught the boy stealing sunflowers and put him in the back of the truck to take him to the police station, but said he jumped, causing his own death.

His killing incited riots in the racially divided town of Coligny, about 125 miles west of Johannesburg.

The judge determined that the killing “happened on the spur of the moment” and was not premeditated. He added, “The community of Coligny was terrorized by this.”

Racial tensions flared in the town where most farms and businesses are owned by whites. Residents rallied and rioted in the town after the teen’s death and took out their angst over the death against white business owners, especially.

One of those employees - identified simply as Susan, to protect her identity - said that with one click of her mouse, she was fired from her job as a surgical nurse last week.

""Simply put, it was just morbid curiosity,"" she said. ""I went into the charting system and started to search his name.""

""I clicked just once,"" Susan said. ""I never clicked into his chart.""

Susan said she was fired on the spot for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, that sets standards for patient privacy and confidentiality.

When asked specifically about the terminations and any disciplinary actions taken, a spokesman for Northwestern Medicine said he could not discuss on the situation due to HIPAA restrictions and company policy preventing him from commenting on any employee's employment status.

Smollett was charged last month with disorderly conduct in filing a false police report, a felony that carries a sentence ranging from probation to up to three years in prison.

Authorities said Smollett reported on Jan. 29 that he was physically attacked as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant. He said two masked men shouted racial, anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" as they looped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him before running away.

On Feb. 15, Chicago police took two ""persons of interest"" into custody, saying the following day that the investigation had ""shifted"" based on the two men's accounts, and requesting a follow-up interview with Smollett. Chicago police then arrested Smollett on Feb. 21, alleging that he staged the attack himself.

Following the alleged attack, Smollett was treated for bruises and facial lacerations at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where the curiosity of dozens of employees was piqued.

Another nurse, who was not fired but asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, said terminations were made across Northwestern facilities throughout the Chicago area.

""Officially, we have been told that every employee involved in the breach of Mr. Smollett’s HIPAA information was terminated,"" the nurse said.

Susan said she stopped short of opening Smollett's chart and looking at his medical records, but acknowledged that searching his name was wrong, saying, ""I had no business doing that.""

She added that she was sorry and said, ""If I could take it back, I would.""

Employees said scrolling past patient names and even accessing their charts is a common occurrence in their line of work, another patient privacy issue the hospital would not address. Representatives for Smollett declined to comment as well."

Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime. The actor was then released after he posted $10,000 of his $100,000 bond.

The allegations against Smollett stem from an alleged attack on the actor in late January, which Chicago Police now believe to be a hoax orchestrated by Smollett to further his career. They also allege that, prior to the attack, he sent himself a threatening letter, which did not receive the attention he had hoped it would.

Smollett has maintained that he is a victim and has denied all the allegations that he staged the incident.

Smollett's next hearing is set for March 14.

“Were you happy to hear that Fox News’ Jesse Watters gave you props for this interview after that Jussie Smollett interview you did?” Stephen Colbert asked King on the Late Show Thursday night.

“Oh my gosh Stephen, I couldn’t believe this,” King reacted.

The CBS This Morning anchor said she emailed Perino to thank her for the correction: “I said, ‘Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I, it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people.”

“And can you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people don’t look alike?” she added.

Officials said last month they launched the internal investigation “during the interrogation of the brothers when information leaked out,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the police department. Police say Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime attack with the help of two brothers in late January.

However, during the probe, they realized case information was being leaked to news agencies.

“I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,” Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday evening. “These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.”

This news comes on the heels of another investigation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital where dozens of workers may have been terminated for “improperly reviewing the medical records” of the Empire actor, just so they could sneak a peak at his medical chart.

One nurse, who preferred to remain unnamed, claims it was a misunderstanding, and denies ever accessing Smollett’s chart. However, she did concede that she and many other nurses and hospital employees were fired last week due to allegations of misconduct concerning Smollett’s confidential information.

The nurse claims she that at the end of her shift last Tuesday, she was called in by her employers and unceremoniously terminated on the spot, then escorted out of the building, without ever being provided an opportunity to defend herself.

She maintains that she never accessed the actor’s chart directly, but did innocently scroll past his name while looking for another patient’s name. She’s appealing her dismissal and is speaking out because she fears others may have been overzealously fired over the same misunderstanding.

When the station contacted hospital officials for comment on the multiple terminations, a spokesman said company policy prevents him from commenting on the employment status of any of their employees.

Smollett was admitted to Northwestern on Jan. 29, and at the time claimed he was attacked by two assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. He has since been charged with staging the whole incident in what police believe was a “publicity stunt” to get a higher salary from for his role on the FOX Network show.

The actor continues to maintain that he is innocent."

Some stopped to say hello to familiar faces, and others caught up with friends. Many had been here before, to pick up what they needed from the collection of donated shoes, coats and shirts. But on this day, they all congregated in the center of the room, where a special delivery of bras and maxipads waited for them.

With poverty affecting about 40 million Americans, many women struggle to make ends meet. That means a $10 box of pads each month for their periods may not make the family grocery list. A $25 bra that fits properly can become a luxury. It’s been reported that many women have even traded tampons for food stamps.

For the women in February who visited So Others Might Eat (SOME), a human services agency that supports poor and homeless D.C. residents, they were receiving the bras and sanitary products for free — a welcome help when there are other things to worry about.

Shawn, who is re-entering society, was shopping for bras at SOME’s clothing closet when InsideEdition.com visited.

“I have been diagnosed with breast cancer,"" she said. ""I’m about to have surgery and … I have to wear certain type of bras that I can’t afford to buy because I am not working. It means a lot. I don’t have money to pay for them,” Shawn said.

Shawn’s new post-surgery bra came as part of a donation from I Support the Girls, a nonprofit that collects new and used bras, as well as sealed menstrual products, and donates them to women in need. A 42-year-old mom named Dana Marlowe has been running the company out of her split-level home in Silver Spring, Maryland, for the last four years.

On Feb. 21, I Support the Girls donated 2,293 bras and 4,179 maxipads to SOME. The polka-dotted bras, neon-colored bras, push-up bras and sports bras all overflowed from four large plastic bins on a folding table. Pads and panty liners piled up in a fifth bin.

The women sifted elbow-deep through the bins to find their sizes and color preferences. Some went for bright blues while others wanted classic nudes or basic blacks. A few women were thankful for larger sizes and clasp-extenders.

Picking up a white satin bra with thick, padded straps, one woman laughed at the garment’s “colonial” look. “That’s cute,” she said upon further inspection, tucking it under her arm as she looked for another one.

Another woman, Donna, was happy to have a place to take time out of her day and shop for something new. She hoped that there could one day be special boutiques for her and the other women to visit, where they could be fitted for bras as well. She imagined string lights hanging from the ceilings and red curtains separating the fitting rooms. “It’s the little things,” she said, that would make it “a pleasant experience.”

“Everyone deserves a bra,” Donna added.

Sports bras are the most popular donated item, Marlowe said. There’s more fabric in a sports bra, which can be useful for someone carrying their belongings with them during the day.

Marlowe told the story of Crystal, who specifically requested a sports bra during one donation day. Marlowe said Crystal told her that a sports bra can “double as a purse.”

“I never thought of a sports bra that way,” Marlowe said. “She said, ‘I can put my most precious items there: my family photos, my money, my most treasured items that I don’t want anyone to steal. And I can just slip them into that extra bit of fabric in the sports bra.’”

And while bras have practical uses for the people who wear them, Marlowe said they’re not just physical items.

“This is more than the bra — this is more than a package of pads. We’re giving women dignity. And that’s it, pure and simple,” Marlowe.

For Michelle Garner, that dignity is in how she can present herself to the outside world.

“It makes me feel wonderful. … When I ain’t have a bra, you don’t look right. … It just looks appropriate for you to have on a bra, and you feel like a young lady,” Garner said.

Like Garner, Crystal also wanted to feel good about herself, Marlowe recalled. “‘I really want a red, lacy bra,’” Marlowe remembers Crystal telling her.

Crystal loved to look at magazine covers. ""You always see women in red, lacy bras and they always look so happy,"" Marlowe recounted Crystal as saying. ""... 'I really would like to have that feeling of feeling a little bit sexy and wearing it close to my chest, but underneath all of my clothes so it doesn’t put me at risk in my lifestyle. … I’m not always in safe environments and I wouldn’t want anyone to know it’s there, but I’ll know it’s there underneath my clothes and it makes me smile and it’s close to me heart.'""

Marlowe added, smiling: ""So we got Crystal a couple of red, lacy bras that day too.""

These bras and menstrual products are extremely personal for the women receiving them — but also for the women donating them. Marlowe said many donors include ""heartfelt"" handwritten notes when they mail their items to I Support the Girls, and they tell stories of giving up things that can no longer be part of their daily lives.

One note reads: ""Three years ago I was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer. I had a mastectomy, lymph node dissection, chemo, radiation and reconstruction — the whole thing. I’m just now on the other side, but if someone will hold onto these bras, which are no longer an option for me, I hope I’m able to help someone else.""

Another reads: ""I will be having a full hysterectomy this month and will obviously not be needing these in the future. Wanted to make sure someone could have them. Here are some tampons.""

Devastating Consequences

Many people can take these undergarments and hygiene products for granted. They can't wait to unhook their bras after a long day, or leave unused pads wrinkled at the bottom of their purses. But these things can also ""empower a woman,” Marlowe says. A bra, for example, helps her to “stand up straighter, feel better about herself, have her clothes lay right, more comfortably.”

Otherwise, Garner said, “sometimes we gotta try to wrap ourselves and get some things on our own.”

The idea of women taking other measures to support their breasts was “eye-opening” for Marlowe.

“I’ve met several women who have been keeping their breasts up with old cracked leather belts. … Like the kind that I’m keeping my pants up with, they’re keeping their breasts up with. The discomfort that that makes me feel, to think about how that woman is managing on 100-degree day, living in a hot, sweaty climate, having an old cracked, chafing belt, chafing and rubbing up against her skin because she doesn’t have access to a bra.”

And when women don’t have access to menstrual hygiene products, the consequences are devastating.

Nearly one in five girls has left class early or missed school entirely because she didn’t have access to feminine products. And if a young girl skips school every time she has her period, that puts her 145 days behind her male classmates. In some countries, girls may drop out of school altogether because they don’t have access to proper menstruation management.

“When it comes to providing some pads and tampons, we’re providing a little bit of respite, of dignity, of not soiling your pants or your clothing; of dignity of not having to miss a meal because you need to buy pads or tampons,"" Marlowe said.

Many women and girls can be left to take alternative measures to manage their menstruation when they don't have hygiene products. Marlowe said she has spoken with women who are forced to use ripped up cardboard or wads of toilet paper.

Wadding up toilet paper in their underwear is likely something many women have experienced when their period catches them by surprise, ""but ideally,” Marlowe said, “you’re not experiencing that hour after hour, day after day, month after month.”

Others have told Marlowe that they have “taken a maxi pad and pulled out the inner cotton and wrapped it up to make a makeshift tampon and have several of them from one maxi pad, so that it goes longer.” Or they’re using “the insides of mattresses … or ripped up T-shirts.”

Kate Wiley, SOME’s communication manager, said it’s these products — bras and menstrual products — that many people don't think about when donating to organizations.

“But once you imagine not being able to have access to those things, I think you realize how essential that is … to feeling like you can kind of tackle whatever it is that you need to tackle. So I think having organizations like I Support the Girls and others who come and donate those items, they really make a much bigger impact than I think we would normally think about a bra,"" Wiley said.

Marlowe recognizes that menstruation is still a taboo topic for a lot of people and cultures, and that there is shame in dealing with it. So along with donating the hygiene products, she works to normalize the conversation.

“The thing about taboo topics is often taboo topics shouldn’t be taboo. … If somebody was like, walking around saying, ‘Oh, your upstairs bathroom’s out of toilet paper.’ I wouldn’t be like, let me just hide it in my jacket and bring it up discreetly. No, I’d bring up the roll of toilet paper,” Marlowe said.

A Family Affair

Being a mom of two young boys, Marlowe said normalization has to start young.

“My kids are involved and they know age-appropriate information about periods and menstruation and they help me bring home pads and tampons and bras. I mean, they’re basically bra mules at school,” she said.

Micah, 10, knows that women have periods and they “need menstrual cups and other things once a month."" He said he feels good knowing that he and his mom help people get what they need.

“I’m learning how to bag bras, fold bras, bag maxipads,” Micah said. He also is improving his counting skills, by counting individually sealed tampons.

Seven-year-old Riley added, “I’m learning that homeless women can be stronger because of my mom’s company and feel better.”

Marlowe didn’t expect her sons to become bra mules, or her home to be turned into the headquarters of a global nonprofit. Back in 2015, she had just lost 35 pounds and needed new bras. So she headed to her local Soma lingerie store.

“As I was getting fitted, I asked the sales associate what could I do with my perfectly good old bras that no longer fit,” Marlowe said.

Then, the associate said the four words that changed Marlowe’s life: “Homeless women need bras.”

“That for me was eye-opening,” Marlowe said, adding that she was the kind of person, like many other women, who “just kept shoving bras into my drawer.”

Marlowe realized that inside that drawer were 16 bras she wasn’t using — and could give away. After telling a friend about her plan, Marlowe’s collection instantly doubled. And then she turned to Facebook.

“That first donation was the end of October 2015, and we donated over 1,000 bras and over 7,100 menstrual hygiene products. I thought it was a lot,” Marlowe said.

Making a Difference Worldwide

To date, I Support the Girls has distributed more than 3 million bras and menstrual products around the globe. With 50 affiliate locations worldwide, the nonprofit has donated to 500 organizations, which include homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, refugee resettlement homes, foster care agencies, LGBTQ agencies and homes for pregnant teens.

Recently, I Support the Girls provided bras and menstrual products to government workers during the shutdown. Turning once again to Facebook, Marlowe received messages from a mother who couldn’t afford all the menstrual products for herself and her three teenage girls, as well as from a mother who had just stopped nursing and needed a new bra to fit her changing breasts, The Washington Post reported.

And these personal items are being sent to Marlowe from every corner of Earth: from Japan and Australia to Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, Taiwan, China, Argentina, Costa Rica, France, England, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

""The wild part of it is that these are strangers mailing me their undergarments,” Marlowe said.

Many are mailed straight to her — or at least a tiny P.O. box at the local post office. But because the box is only big enough to hold a few small letters, the post office has turned into a makeshift receiving center for I Support the Girls.

In a given week, Marlowe can receive over 100 packages, so she must drive her van up to the post office's large loading dock as employees wheel out big industrial-size rolling baskets that are overflowing with packages. Then, like a game of Tetris, Marlowe packs them strategically into her van so they all fit. When she's done, she can't even see out the back window.

Marlowe then brings the packages back to her basement, which doubles as her family’s movie room and the I Support the Girls sorting center. Meticulously noting each package’s return address so she and other volunteers can write a thank you note to the sender, the donations are unpacked, counted, and bagged for distribution — awaiting to be taken to an organization or to be picked up. And the cycle continues.

But Marlowe wants people to know that there’s ""nothing innately special"" about her, and that anyone who wants to help … can.

""I'm not a medical professional, I'm not a social worker, I'm not somebody with a background in reproductive health management or menstrual hygiene management. I'm just a woman with a period, right? But if somebody like that ... if just a regular woman with a period can go out and talk about why these products equate to dignity and how to break the taboos and normalize it and remove the stigma and advocate for policy, well then anyone could do it,"" she said.

Added Marlowe, ""I'm just a suburban mom"" — whom strangers are mailing their undergarments to.

Wouldn’t that alienate about half of the people you want to tune in to your show? Wouldn’t you worry that future potential employers would take note, and decide that hiring you would be a liability rather than an asset? Or is the entire media and entertainment industry really that clueless about and contemptuous of the people they’re trying to get to buy their product? Perhaps so; perhaps it’s why so much of what passes for entertainment these days is more irritating and tendentious than enjoyable. Whatever the case, I suspect we won’t have Jussie Smollett to kick around anymore.

So it seems there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia after all, in spite of a few political naïfs and lowlifes talking to Russian dirty tricksters trying to stir up trouble (and succeeding). The puzzling thing is, the charge never made much sense, and it’s been obvious to any reasonable person for over a year. So why have so many people clung desperately to the conviction that it just had to be true? Particularly those in the news media, who are supposed to at least pretend they’re objective truth-seekers with a strong streak of cynicism? Are those people now going to admit their mistake and make amends? I won’t hold my breath, but I will enjoy a laugh or two at their expense. What a waste of time, energy, and resources that should have been spent solving real problems.

The corollary of no collusion is that Hillary Clinton lost the election fair and square. That’s what really rankles, isn’t it? Oh, well, perhaps next time the activists on both sides will have gotten over their temper tantrums and will give us a better choice. Won’t hold my breath for that, either.

You may have noticed that Ralph Northam, Justin Fairfax and Mark Herring have disappeared from the headlines. In case you’re asking Ralph, Justin and Mark who? they are Governor Blackface/KKK/Babykiller, Lt. Gov. Accused Double Rapist and Attorney General Blackface Too. It seems that people have changed their minds about these miscreants resigning their posts immediately, and now think their cases should be thoroughly investigated, they should receive due process, and some consideration should be given to callow youth. Is it just me, or does this debacle smack of more than a little hypocrisy? Could it be the fact that the Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates would become governor played some ever-so-small part in the sudden about-face? In any case, someone be sure to tell Brett Kavanaugh, who will be gratified to learn that the Democratic Party has seen the light, and that no future Supreme Court nominee will have to run a gauntlet of character assassination like he did. Just joking, of course. It’s unlikely the Democrats will learn anything from this episode, and character assassination is just too good a tool to take it out of their tool box. After all, it worked for Robert Bork, and it almost worked for Clarence Thomas and Kavanaugh. One taken down and two more seriously wounded ain’t bad.

Speaking of seeing the light, Amazon will not be building a headquarters in Queens, New York, after all. That didn’t take long. Never made much sense anyway. Any place that would elect an outspoken, permanently outraged socialist to Congress (the oh-so-radical-chic AOC, she of the “Green New Deal”) could be counted on to be business-unfriendly. Let me make a suggestion. Amazon, the TriCities is very business-friendly, but it can’t accommodate 25,000 jobs. A couple of thousand, yes. Spread the balance around the rest of Tennessee, which will be just as happy to have them as we are. Your and your employees’ money will go about 40 percent further, our climate is a lot better, there’s no income tax, and we’ll put our lifestyle up against Queens, New York, any day. We may not have the charms of the Big Apple, but we don’t have its pollution, noise, overcrowding or crime, either. They’ve got Manhattan, we’ve got the Appalachian Trail and a million other things to do outdoors. The Barter Theater compares favorably to anything on or off Broadway. As for music, well. So ya’ll come on down, we’d be mighty glad to have you.

A spokesman for the city's police department told ABC News late Thursday that an investigation into the leaks had launched in February after some of the information leaked to the media about the case from law enforcement sources proved to be inaccurate.

""I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,"" Chicago Police Department's Anthony Guglielmi told ABC News. ""These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.""

Guglielmi added to ABC that the probe was launched ""during the interrogation of the brothers when information leaked out"" concerning two men who allegedly knew Smollett and who police now say were hired by the ""Empire"" star to stage an attack.

Smollett told police earlier this year that two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs as well as pro-Trump messages such as ""This is MAGA country"" attacked him late at night while he was walking in a Chicago neighborhood, dousing him with an unknown chemical substance and placing a noose around his neck.

Police investigated the claim initially as a hate crime, but later told reporters that they did not think Smollett's story was true.

The actor has maintained his innocence but has been largely written out of the hit show on which he once had a starring role.

President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE himself has aimed criticism at Smollett over the controversy, tweeting that the actor owed his supporters an apology after blaming them for a racist attack.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men’s help and made a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

Stephen Colbert asked about Fox News’ Jesse Watters mixing her up with Robin Roberts, who had interviewed Jussie Smollett.

King laughed and recounted how after Dana Perino corrected Watters on-air, she got Perino’s email address and wrote:

‘Thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people, and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?’ Yes, I did, I sent that to her.

Watters apologized on Wednesday after confusing CBS News host Gayle King with Good Morning America host Robin Roberts. He apologized at the end of The Five episode Watters held up a small whiteboard reiterating his apology to the two anchors. “I’m sorry Gayle + Robin.”

On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel couldn’t get enough of the R. Kelly bombshells. But “this was the masterstroke,” he said.

“So to defend himself against allegations of weird and illegal and inappropriate sexual relationships, to prove he’s a normal and respectful guy, R. Kelly brought in both of his live-in girlfriends to support him.”

He showed how that looked, then mashed-up the King interview with Kelly’s greatest hit to create “I Believe I Can Lie.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd4KxJGx-oE

King said both she and the live-in girlfriends — Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23; Kelly is 52 — thought Kelly was out of the room for that interview, but he was just out of sight, coughing loudly at questions he didn’t like.

“Both sets of parents are terrified because they believe their daughters have been brainwashed,” King told Colbert.

King revealed that she didn’t expect Kelly to confess his crimes, “but I did think that, on some level, he would have a moment of reflection, he would have contrition.”

Instead, she said, “I thought we were witnessing the self-destruction of a man having a breakdown, and that’s never a good thing to see. Never.”

""Empire"" actor Smollett claimed in January to be a victim of a racial and homophobic attack in January. Chicago PD charged him with making a false police report about a month later.

While investigations were ongoing multiple news outlets published information about the case that were unconfirmed by police. The outlets cited anonymous sources familiar with the case.

Sergeant Rocco Alioto told reporters that it was ""standard procedure"" to open an internal investigation ""when there are allegations of information being leaked.""

The Chicago Police Department has launched an internal investigation into officers probing actor Jussie Smollett's claim of being victim of a racial attack earlier this year, due to reports that the police had leaked information about the case while it was ongoing.

Sergeant Rocco Alioto, a Chicago PD spokesman, told reporters on Thursday: ""As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

""I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,"" he added.

Smollett, who starred in ""Empire,"" told police in January that he was attacked by two masked men who beat him, made racist and derogatory comments, and then put a noose around his neck.

But police found inconsistencies in Smollett's account, and on February 21 charged him with making a false police report. Officers accused him of making up the attack as a ""publicity stunt"" to get a bigger salary.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for ""destroying"" his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired on Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of CBS This Morning. He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, ""How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can't work?""

The 52-year old singer was jailed on Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161 000 in back child support. He said he had ""zero"" relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired on Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

R Kelly in explosive interview about sexual abuse allegations: 'I didn't do this stuff' Chicago - In his first interview since being charged with sexually abusing four people, including three underage girls, R. Kelly says he ""didn't do this stuff"" and he's fighting for his life. The R&B singer, out on bail after his 22 February arrest in Chicago , gave the interview to Gayle King of CBS This Morning, with excerpts airing on Tuesday night.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a ""sex cult.""



Experts said Kelly's appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

""In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,"" said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. ""I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.""

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but ""historically it's a bad idea,"" Birkett said.

AN EXAMPLE

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago.

In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's Good Morning America identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

Brothers who allegedly helped Jussie Smollett stage attack have issued an apology Cape Town - The brothers, who Jussie Smollett allegedly paid to stage a hate crime attack against him, have issued a public apology through their attorney. The 36-year-old was charged with felony disorderly conduct , a charge that could bring up to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a 29 January beating.

In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.



""A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,"" Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, ""this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary"" to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star ""may not know all the evidence against him.""

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman's claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not ""knowingly"" have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available on Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview — but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and ""stick to a script.""

""If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,"" he said.

On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a ""big heart"" who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!"" He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.""

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was ""not about music.""

""I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it"" because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. ""You all just don't want to believe it.""

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing ""expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60 000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokesperson for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his 22 February arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100 000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — also are set to air. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day."

ABC News(CHICAGO) — The Chicago Police Department is conducting an internal investigation to determine who anonymously leaked information about the Jussie Smollett case to members of the press.

Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the police department, confirmed to ABC News that the probe was launched last month “during the interrogation of the brothers when information leaked out,” referring to the two Osundairo brothers who investigators said helped stage an attack on the Empire actor in late January.

“I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,” Guglielmi told ABC News Thursday evening. “These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.”

The internal investigation was first reported by TMZ.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical was poured on him. The alleged assailants, police were told, yelled “MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

Police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. Those men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested on Feb. 13, but police didn’t charge them and said at the time neither remained a suspect.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent on Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series Empire is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

The memo line on the $3,500 check read that it was for personal training, sources said. Police obtained a search warrant for the check and have text messages between Smollett and the brothers as well.

On Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself in to police the next morning.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who pleaded not guilty, was released after posting 10 percent of his bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for March 14.

Stephen Colbert engaged in a little CBS programming synergy on Thursday’s Late Show, inviting CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King on to publicize her now-infamous interview with embattled singer and multiply accused pedophile R. Kelly. With the widely shared photo (snapped by King’s makeup guy) of Kelly, mid-rant, gesticulating forcefully over the unimpressed and seated King serving as everyone’s indelible image of the encounter, Colbert asked King if she had felt threatened in the moment. “I really wasn’t worried,” said King about the interaction, claiming that her only real concern in the heat of things was that Kelly, as he’s done multiple times in the past, would storm out and leave her without an interview. With Colbert praising her composure as akin to “a graven image from a temple or something,” King reiterated that she never felt like she was in physical danger—at least not intentionally. She did admit that the thought crossed her mind that the emotional Kelly might accidentaly sock her one while he vociferously protested his innocence.



The entire interview airs Friday at 8 p.m. on CBS, serving as a companion piece to Lifetime’s damning documentary miniseries Surviving R. Kelly. In addition to asking Kelly those questions he really didn’t care for about the allegations that he’s spent decades pursuing sexual relationships with underage girls, King told Colbert about interviewing the 52-year-old singer’s two current live-in girlfriends, aged 21 and 23, and how Kelly snuck back into the room in order to signal his displeasure with King’s questions to them. Saying that Kelly—who’d originally promised to absent himself—could be heard both debating with her staff and coughing loudly to seemingly signal the two women, King continued to be serenely baffled by Kelly’s behavior. “I did think that, on some level, he could have a moment of reflection, he would have contrition,” King told Colbert, before summing up her experience by saying, “I thought we were witnessing the self-destruction of a man having a breakdown.”

King’s vaunted composure also served her well when confronting not just an enraged suspected sex monster, but a smirking right-wing dingbat as well, as she told Colbert about how she responded to Fox News’ Jesse Watters confusing her, on-air, with fellow black woman broadcaster and completely different human being Robin Roberts. After noted race-baiting failed comedian and current contestant for the coveted “most racist”/“least competent” Fox News personality prize Watters condescendingly complimented King for redeeming herself after her interview with apparent false-report-filer Jussie Smollett, Watters’ co-host Dana Perino corrected Watters as to the fact that, yes, two different black women hold high-profile interviewer positions. Which King says she appreciated and all, sending an email thanking Perino, while slipping in the politely icy request that Perino “let the rest of [her] colleagues know that not all black people look alike.” As the saying goes, don’t come at the King."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men's help and made a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

American R&B singer-songwriter R Kelly appeared in an explosive television interview on Wednesday, in which he defended himself against the ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse that he has been charged with. At least nine of those charges involve minor girls.

Kelly spent three nights in custody in relation to the charges and was released on February 25 after furnishing a bond of $100,000, Chicago Sun Times reported. He was arrested again on Wednesday evening for failing to pay $1,61,000 in child support to his ex-wife.

In the interview with Gayle King on CBS This Morning, Kelly maintained his innocence, yelling “I don’t need to, why would I?” when King asked him if he had ever held women against their will, as reported by BuzzFeed News in July 2017. The musician repeatedly shouted, broke down in tears and jumped out of his chair during the interview, urging people to “use common sense” as to why someone with his past would do such a thing. Kelly was indicted on 13 counts of child pornography in 2002, but was acquitted of all charges in 2008.

The interview, Kelly’s first since he was released from custody, came just a few weeks after the release of Surviving R Kelly, a six-part documentary series detailing sexual abuse allegations against the singer.

Kelly’s interview caused a storm on social media, with many pointing to the aggression displayed by him towards King and his erratic answers to her questions.

Kelly — even some journalists who apparently don’t know who she is.

Sitting down with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” Thursday night, the host asked King about an embarrassing incident with Fox News political commentator Jesse Watters on Wednesday.

During an episode of the Fox News panel talk show “The Five”, Watters said, “Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.” However, it was journalist Robin Roberts who famously interviewed Smollett about his alleged attack, not King.

“I couldn’t believe it,” King said with a laugh. “So many people started sending this to me, because I normally don’t watch Fox News, unless I’m just curious to see what’s going on and what other people are thinking.”

Immediately after Watters’ mistake, his co-host Dana Perino corrected him, quickly adding, “That was not Gayle King. Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview.”

“So I emailed Dana, who I don’t know, I got her email and I said, ‘Hi, I just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I — it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,'” King recalled to Colbert. “‘And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike.'”

“It’s good to remind them every so often,” Colbert joked, taking a swipe at Fox News’ famously conservative pundits. According to King, Perino wrote back and said it was nice to meet her, and that they “had a little joke about it.”

“I hope to meet her one day, because I think that was really nice of her to do,” King added.

Watters, ultimately, apologized after being corrected, and again at the end of that episode of “The Five”, when he held up a small dry erase white board on which he’d written, “I’m sorry Gayle + Robin.”

The accolades King has been receiving for her powerful interview with Kelly — who is currently facing charges on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse, among other charges — aren’t just from other journalists, but family, friends, and even megastar celebrities.

Right as King sat down across from Colbert, she excitedly revealed that she’d just gotten a personal phone call from iconic musician Elton John moments before coming out onto stage.

“In the green room, Elton John called me!” King exclaimed. “It was a 212 number that I didn’t recognize, so I thought it was work… and he goes, ‘Gayle, it’s Elton here.’ And I go, ‘Elton John?! Hi, Elton!’ And he was calling to talk about the R. Kelly interview. I thought that it was so nice that he called.”

“Yeah, he calls a lot of my guests,” Colbert quipped.

""It's good to remind them every so often,"" Colbert joked, taking a swipe at Fox News' famously conservative pundits. According to King, Perino wrote back and said it was nice to meet her, and that they ""had a little joke about it.""

""I hope to meet her one day, because I think that was really nice of her to do,"" King added.

Watters, ultimately, apologized after being corrected, and again at the end of that episode of The Five, when he held up a small dry erase white board on which he'd written, ""I’m sorry Gayle + Robin.""

TONIGHT: @GayleKing is here to talk about her R. Kelly interview and give out some friendly reminders. #LSSCpic.twitter.com/rzkWzeO6vL — A Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 8, 2019

The accolades King has been receiving for her powerful interview with Kelly -- who is currently facing charges on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse, among other charges -- aren't just from other journalists, but family, friends, and even megastar celebrities.

Right as King sat down across from Colbert, she excitedly revealed that she'd just gotten a personal phone call from iconic musician Elton John moments before coming out onto stage.

""In the green room, Elton John called me!"" King exclaimed. ""It was a 212 number that I didn't recognize, so I thought it was work… and he goes, 'Gayle, it's Elton here.' And I go, 'Elton John?! Hi, Elton!' And he was calling to talk about the R. Kelly interview. I thought that it was so nice that he called.""

""Yeah, he calls a lot of my guests,"" Colbert quipped.

Kelly for CBS this week was a big enough deal, Gayle King told Stephen Colbert on Thursday's Late Show , that Elton John had just called her in the dressing room. She explained that in the viral image of Kelly standing angrily while she sits calmly, she was mostly trying to keep ""Robert"" from walking out of the interview. ""I never thought that he was going to hurt me or hit me,"" she said, at least not on purpose.

Colbert asked about Fox News' Jesse Watters mixing her up with Robin Roberts, who had interviewed Jussie Smollett. King laughed and recounted how after Dana Perino corrected Watters on-air, she got Perino's email address and wrote: ""'Thank you for letting him know that we're two different people, and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that?' Yes, I did, I sent that to her.""

On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel couldn't get enough of the R. Kelly bombshells. But ""this was the masterstroke,"" he said. ""So to defend himself against allegations of weird and illegal and inappropriate sexual relationships, to prove he's a normal and respectful guy, R. Kelly brought in both of his live-in girlfriends to support him."" He showed how that looked, then mashed-up the King interview with Kelly's greatest hit to create ""I Believe I Can Lie.""

King said both she and the live-in girlfriends — Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23; Kelly is 52 — thought Kelly was out of the room for that interview, but he was just out of sight, coughing loudly at questions he didn't like. ""Both sets of parents are terrified because they believe their daughters have been brainwashed,"" King told Colbert."

The ""CBS This Morning"" anchor reveals what was going through her head when R. Kelly stood up shouting and started flailing his arms toward her, and how she kept her cool. King also revealed how Kelly asked her crew if he could stop interview with his girlfriends.

It's the interview people can't stop talking about, as Gayle King sat so calmly while R. Kelly unraveled before her eyes. She dropped by ""The Late Show"" Thursday night to unpack all the wildness and take Stephen Colbert behind the scenes.

She also threw some pretty wicked shade toward Fox News, understandably a little irritated after commentator Jesse Watters conflated her and Robin Roberts. The co-host of ""The Five"" faced a little heat after he complimented King's interview, saying it redeemed her for her previous interview with Jussie Smollett.

The only problem is that wasn't King at all, that was Robin Roberts. Watters' co-host Dana Perino corrected him, which King appreciated, and so she sent a lovely email to show her gratitude, while slipping in a pretty barbed dig at both Watters and the entire network. Watters also apologized on air.

King told Colbert she wrote, ""Hi, I just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I -- It was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we're two different people. And could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike. Could you please just share that.""

As the audience cheered, she added with a smile, ""Yes I did. I said that to her.""

Colbert couldn't help but offer his own praise for her work in that interview. Not only did she ask the right questions, and challenge Kelly when he tried to evade her questions or get completely off-topic (at least to the best of her abilities), she showed remarkable poise in the face of a rather volatile and unpredictable subject.

R. Kelly is currently facing ten charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. He denies those charges as well as all of the allegations of sexual abuse and underage sexual abuse that have been levied at him over the years. He was acquitted of similar charges years ago.

The singer is currently incarcerated for unpaid back child support, having been arrested shortly after this interview, which could also have led to his volatile emotional state.

""I could see him getting more heated,"" King said. ""He was upset with me about some of the questions; that's okay. He was a little irritated; that's okay."" But when he stood up and started flailing his arms, that's when her poise really stood out. And Gayle said it was a calculated decision to sit there so calmly, and even say his name in that soothing but stern manner.

In fact, her first concern wasn't for her safety, it was that he might leave. ""So I decided if I sit there quietly, make eye contact with him,"" she said. ""I thought the minute I walk up and say-- If I stood up, like, 'Calm down!' ... So I thought if I just sit there quietly looking at him, he would know I'm not going anywhere and I'll just wait for you to finish whatever this is and then you'll sit back down in the seat, and he did that.""

She also thought, ""You're looking a little crazy right now, please sit back down.""

When it came time to interview Kelly's girlfriends, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, King had no idea that R. Kelly had slipped back into the room. ""R. Kelly comes back in so he can hear the conversation; he's out of my eyesight and he's out of the girls' eyesight, too,"" she said. ""But when there was a question he didnt like, and I can't remember what it was, you hear this."" At this point she started aggressively coughing.

King thought it was someone on her staff very unprofessionally ruining the interview, but it was Kelly. She also revealed that he was pacing back and forth off-camera and even going so far as to ask her crew if he should go in and shut down the interview. Of course, they said no.

""I am told that R. Kelly is talking to members of my own team,"" King recalled, adding that Kelly asked her crew members, ""'They're doing okay. They're doing okay? Should I go in there and stop it? Should I go in and stop it?' He's having a dialogue with people in my team!""

As for the girls themselves, King noted how angry they both were during that interview, and said she even got an apologetic phone call from Clary's father afterward. ""That is not the daughter I raised, I don't know who that girl is, I'm so sorry,"" she recalled him saying.

She even admitted after her interview with them aired Thursday morning that her own motherly instincts had her wanting to snatch them up and take them away. ""It's a bad situation. I think one day years from now, everybody will look back on this and say it's very sad, very tawdry and just very very ugly,"" she said.

""We don't know how the R. Kelly story is going to end, but what I do know is those girls are going to need their family sooner I think rather than later, so it was heartbreaking,"" she told Colbert Thursday night.

As for Kelly, King admitted that she never expected him to break down and confess to anything. ""I did think that on some level he would have a moment of reflection, he would have contrition,"" she admitted. ""So it became very troubling to me to see him really just fall apart.

She went on to add, ""I thought we were witnessing the self-destruction of a man having a breakdown, and that's never a good thing to see.""

Viewers will get to see even more of King's reportedly 80-minute interview with Kelly in an hour-long special set to air Friday night at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.

Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the police department, confirmed to ABC News that the probe was launched last month ""during the interrogation of the brothers when information leaked out,"" referring to the two Osundairo brothers who investigators said helped stage an attack on the ""Empire"" actor in late January.

""I will also add that there were several agencies briefed with information during that time and some of the information that went out was not factually accurate,"" Guglielmi told ABC News on Thursday evening. ""These types of investigations are fairly common so that we can determine if we have any integrity issues for future cases.""

The internal investigation was first reported by TMZ.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and an unknown chemical was poured on him. The alleged assailants, police were told, yelled ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan.

Police identified and questioned two ""persons of interest"" captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack. Those men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were arrested Feb. 13, but police didn't charge them and said at the time neither remained a suspect.

While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed Smollett paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan. 22 to the Fox studio where the television series ""Empire"" is filmed, did not get enough attention, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

The memo line on the $3,500 check read that it was for personal training, sources said. Police obtained a search warrant for the check and have text messages between Smollett and the brothers as well.

On Feb. 20, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report. By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury.

Smollett, who has consistently denied any role in staging the supposed crime, turned himself in to police the next morning.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. The actor, who pleaded not guilty, was released after posting 10 percent of his bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for March 14.

The media and political establishments are diddling while the planet burns.

Are we really supposed to take their games seriously as humanity veers ever more dangerously off the environmental cliff?

In 2008, James Hansen, then head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and seven other leading climate scientists reported that we would see “practically irreversible ice sheet and species loss” if the planet’s average temperature rose above 1°Celsius (C) thanks to carbon dioxide’s (CO2) presence in the atmosphere reaching 450 parts per million (ppm).

CO2 was at 385 ppm when this report came out. It was “already in the dangerous zone,” Hansen and his team reported. They warned that deadly, self-reinforcing “feedbacks” could be triggered at this level. The dire prospects presaged included “ice sheet disintegration, vegetation migration, and GHG [greenhouse gas] release from soils, tundra, or ocean sediments.”

The only way to be assured of a livable climate, Hansen and his colleagues warned, would be to cut CO2 to at least 350 ppm.

Here we are eleven years later, well past Hansen’s 1°C red line. We’ve gotten there at 410 ppm, the highest level of CO2 saturation in 800,000 years. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s latest climate report reflects the consensus opinion of the world’s leading climate scientists. It tells us that we are headed to 1.5°C in a dozen years. Failure to dramatically slash Greenhouse Gassing between now and 2030 is certain to set off catastrophic developments for hundreds of millions of people, the IPCC warns.

The IPCC finds that we are headed at our current pace for 3-4°C by the end of century. That will mean a planet that is mostly unlivable.

And here’s the kicker: numerous serious climate scientists find that the IPCC’s findings are insufficiently alarmist and excessively conservative. That’s because the IPCC deletes and downplays research demonstrating the likelihood that irreversible climatological “tipping points” will arrive soon. Among many reports pointing in this direction is a recent NASA-funded study warning that the unexpectedly rapid thawing of permafrost could release massive volumes of CO2 and methane within “a few decades.”

Conservative though it may be, the UN report is no whitewash. It calls for “unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” to drop global CO2 emissions 45 percent below 2010 levels and 60 percent below 2015 levels by 2030. We need to hit zero by the mid-century point, the IPCC says. We cannot do that without radically and rapidly reducing our energy consumption.

In a remotely decent and intelligent society, public and political “elites” and “leaders” and the dominant media and politics culture would be fervently focused first and foremost on this problem. The climate catastrophe (“climate change” is far too mild a term to capture the real crisis of capitalogenic global warming) is the biggest issue of our any time. As the environmental blogger Robert Scribbler wrote four years ago, “There is no greater threat presented by another nation or set of circumstances that supersedes what we are now brazenly doing to our environment and the Earth System as a whole. And the rate at which we are causing the end level of damage to increase is practically unthinkable. Each further year of inaction pushes us deeper into that dangerous future.”

If the global warming cataclysm – already significantly underway in vast swaths of the planet – isn’t averted and soon, then nothing else we care about is going to matter all that much. We’ll just be arguing about how to fairly slice up a badly overheated pie – how to turn an overcooked world upside down (or right-side up) and how to properly manage a living Hell.

You’d hardly know this from the reigning U.S. media and politics culture, where the climate crisis and other critical environmental issues are pushed to the margins of public discussion. It is chilling (no ironic pun intended) to behold. With every passing fossil-fueled day, the specter of “man-made” ecological calamity looms ever closer and larger.

But so what? The chattering and electoral classes and political gossip-peddlers divert us 24-7 with breathless “breaking news” reports on an endless stream of supposedly bigger stories: the absurd Orwellian charge that Ilhan Omar is an anti-Semite; Michael Cohen’s alleged past pursuit of a presidential pardon; Paul Manafort’s latest sentencing hearing; Ivanka Trump’s ridiculous national security clearance; Donald Trump’s insane nativist border wall; Roger Stone’s latest Tweets; the racist medical school yearbook photos of a pathetic white governor; television celebrity Jussie Smollett’s criminal shenanigans; the latest horrible mass-shooting; the latest sex scandal; the latest real or rumored findings in the seemingly interminable investigation of Trump’s racist, sexist, and gangster-capitalist past and presidency.

Nearly two years ago, CNN co-producer John Bonfield was caught on tape telling a right-wing undercover journalist that CNN president Jeff Zucker said this to his executive producers after Trump pulled of the Paris Climate Accords: “Good job everybody covering the climate accords, but we’re done with that. Let’s get back to Russia.”

Climate catastrophe? Television advertisers and hence news broadcasters are not real excited about that story. It’s not a big seller of cars, petroleum products, petroleum, mutual funds, investment advice, drugs, cruise packages, and insurance policies at NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and CNN. Even it did sell well, the climate story doesn’t line up well with corporate advertisers’ carbon-caked balance sheets.

By contrast, the ongoing Trump-Russia-Cohen-Manafort-WikiLeaks-Stone-Stormy et al. soap opera has been a ratings boon. And now we have the 2020 presidential candidate extravaganza – the quadrennial electoral spectacle – coming on to commercial line. It’s the world’s greatest reality show, with the imperial presidency as the ultimate Big Brother prize.

I’m not saying that all of what the “mainstream” media and politicians talk about is silly or insignificant. It matters to defend Rep. Omar, to fight Trump’s wall, to silence and lock up fascists like Stone, to publicize and rollback gun violence, to determine once and for all the nature of Trump’s really strange (sorry “left” Putin fans) relationship with the Russian oligarchy, to expose racism and sexism (and fascism) in the White House and the nation more broadly. Trump’s caging of children at the southern border is an atrocity that should be broadcast and denounced. The same goes for the related clear and present danger Trump presents more broadly to democratic and even just republican and constitutional principles on numerous levels. The 2020 elections and their aftermath (including the distinct possibility that Trump will refuse the Electoral tally) will not be irrelevant to the fate of the nation and the Earth.

But nothing matters more now than the existential environmental crises we face, with the climate disaster in the lead. There’s no chance for social justice, democracy, equality, creativity, art, love and community – or anything else (including profits) – on a dead planet.

Yes, the “Green New Deal” advocated by a cadre of progressive Democrats has made its way into media coverage and commentary in recent months. It appears that the GND – which includes welcome calls for net zero U.S. carbon emissions by 2030 – will be part of at least the primary election story thanks to Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Cortez-Ocasio, Jay Inslee, and other progressive or progressive-sounding Democrats. But don’t expect it to receive all that much attention (much less positive attention) in the dominant corporate media-politics complex. Serious discussion of the climate issue and environmental questions more broadly doesn’t serve broadcasters’ and advertisers’ bottom line interests. There is little chance that the climate crisis will remotely approach the Trump investigations and the already emergent 2020 presidential horse-race when it comes to garnering real media attention.

The reigning political and media “elite” is happy to keep capitalogenic global warming on the public margins until long past the last ecological tipping points are passed. They can be counted on them to fiddle and diddle through the species’ final, fossil-fueled flame-out. It is an existential necessity to create a new culture, media, and politics with the elementary natural and social intelligence required to properly prioritize the most pressing problems of our time.

CHICAGO — Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men's help and made a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi says no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case."

The Simpsons episode guest starring Michael Jackson is being removed from circulation in light of the sexual abuse allegations made in Leaving Neverland.

The top creatives behind the Fox show have confirmed that the episode Stark Raving Dad will be removed from streaming platforms and re-runs, as well as being removed from forthcoming boxsets.

The premiere of the animated series’ third season back in 1991 featured the voice of Michael Jackson as Leon Kompowsky – a man Homer meets in a mental institution who believes he is the Billie Jean singer.

Homer, not knowing who MJ is, believes Leon is the real deal, and when he brings him back to Springfield, the town’s residents all show up to see ‘Michael Jackson’.

Jackson – who was a huge fan of the show – provided the voice for Leon and was credited as John Jay Smith, although a voice double was used for Leon’s singing.

While Stark Raving Dad is one of the best known Simpsons episodes, executive producer James L. Brooks, creator Matt Groening and showrunner Al Jean have decided to pull the episode from recirculation after watching Leaving Neverland – in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck put forward troubling allegations of sexual abuse against the star.

Brooks told the Wall Street Journal: ‘It feels clearly the only choice to make/ The guys I work with — where we spend our lives arguing over jokes — were of one mind on this.’

He added: ‘This was a treasured episode. There are a lot of great memories we have wrapped up in that one, and this certainly doesn’t allow them to remain.’

Leaving Neverland aired in the States on HBO on Sunday and Monday night, while Channel 4 aired the Dan Reed directed documentary on 6 and 7 March.

The four-hour film sees Wade, now 36, James, now 41, and their families discuss their time with Michael, and the two men allege that Jackson sexually abused them as children.

The Michael Jackson estate has denied the allegations, calling them ‘character assassination’, while Michael’s nephew Taj claimed that his uncle was ‘a child at heart’ and accused Robson of ‘100% lying’.

However, the documentary has sparked a lot of debate on social media, while Corey Feldman – who had previously defended Jackson – has changed his stance, claiming he can no longer defend the popstar.

As well as The Simpsons removing Stark Raving Dad from circulation, a Jackson statue has been removed from the National Football Museum, while a number of radio stations worldwide have removed the star’s music from their playlists.

Michael Jackson estate's statement on Leaving Neverland 'Leaving Neverland isn’t a documentary, it is the kind of tabloid character assassination Michael Jackson endured in life, and now in death. The film takes uncorroborated allegations that supposedly happened 20 years ago and treats them as fact. These claims were the basis of lawsuits filed by these two admitted liars which were ultimately dismissed by a judge. The two accusers testified under oath that these events never occurred. They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations, which means the entire film hinges solely on the word of two perjurers. 'Tellingly, the director admitted at the Sundance Film Festival that he limited his interviews only to these accusers and their families. In doing so, he intentionally avoided interviewing numerous people over the years who spent significant time with Michael Jackson and have unambiguously stated that he treated children with respect and did nothing hurtful to them. By choosing not to include any of these independent voices who might challenge the narrative that he was determined to sell, the director neglected fact checking so he could craft a narrative so blatantly one-sided that viewers never get anything close to a balanced portrait. 'For 20 years, Wade Robson denied in court and in numerous interviews, including after Michael passed, that he was a victim and stated he was grateful for everything Michael had done for him. His family benefitted from Michael’s kindness, generosity and career support up until Michael’s death. Conveniently left out of Leaving Neverland was the fact that when Robson was denied a role in a Michael Jackson themed Cirque du Soleil production, his assault allegations suddenly emerged. 'We are extremely sympathetic to any legitimate victim of child abuse. This film, however, does those victims a disservice. Because despite all the disingenuous denials made that this is not about money, it has always been about money – millions of dollars — dating back to 2013 when both Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who share the same law firm, launched their unsuccessful claims against Michael’s Estate. Now that Michael is no longer here to defend himself, Robson, Safechuck and their lawyers continue their efforts to achieve notoriety and a payday by smearing him with the same allegations a jury found him innocent of when he was alive.'

Chicago Police are allegedly carrying out an internal investigation after details from Jussie Smollett’s attack case have been ‘leaked’.

Jussie was attacked by two masked men at the end of January, with authorities treating the incident as a hate crime as the Empire star claimed he was subjected to homophobic and racial abuse.

Two men were questioned and released by police and Jussie was later arrested and charged with filing a false police report, amid claims he had ‘orchestrated’ the attack.

Jussie denies the claims and is expected in court this month over the charges, but TMZ reports the Chicago Police Department are now looking into the case internally, after information has been ‘leaked’ to the media.

They are looking into the leaks, with a police spokesperson stating a lot of the information put out there has been ‘inaccurate’.

They told the publication: ‘When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.’

A police spokesperson added to Fox News: ‘I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation.

‘As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened.’

Claims surrounding Jussie’s case accuse the actor of ‘staging his attack in an attempt to boost his Empire salary’.

Empire bosses aren’t convinced, however, and debunked such claims by alleging Jussie never once asked for a pay rise.

He was already making a reported $125,000 (£95,000) per episode, while his co-stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard are said to take home $250,000 (£187,000) each instalment.

Jussie’s castmates have thrown their full support behind him and Queen Latifah has said she will stand by Jussie unless she gets ‘definitive proof’ to think otherwise.

Speaking on Yahoo series Through Her Eyes, she said: ‘The guy I’ve seen has always been someone who cares about people, who cares about others, and who’s very kind and who’s always been cool and sweet.

‘And that’s just the guy I know. So until I can see some definitive proof — which I haven’t seen yet — then, you know, I gotta go with him until I see otherwise.’

Jussie is expected in court on 16 March.

But what does she make of her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett’s hate-crime controversy?

On a December morning in Los Angeles, the sun blazes down on a large and abundantly decorated Christmas tree in the parking lot at Paramount Pictures. It is upstaged, though, by the actor Taraji P Henson, who swans past wearing an ensemble that calls to mind the futuristic fashion of the 1970s: steampunk sunglasses, a black tracksuit under a puffy gilet and chunky grey, orange and lime sci-fi pumps, possibly with rocket boosters in the soles. Her hair is arranged in tight braids, some piled on her head, others swishing around her shoulders.

As we take our seats in a brightly lit office upstairs, she removes from her flowery backpack a tub of beige mush. What is that, mashed banana? “Nuh-uh,” she says between mouthfuls. “It’s an oatmeal alkaline thing. It’s got quinoa in it. I gotta be careful because I don’t digest a heavy grain.” She takes a sniff and laughs. “It smells like dirt, it really does.” She went vegan last year after a doctor told her it could reduce the chances of getting stomach cancer. “You can do it if you have a good chef,” she says encouragingly. I make a mental note to have a chat with mine.

From anyone else, that remark might have sounded impossibly pompous. But Henson, who is 48, has the informality and downhome directness that is to be expected from someone raised on the breadline in Washington DC. Her best roles draw on that natural earthiness in different ways. As the music industry matriarch Cookie Lyon in five series of the hip-hop soap opera Empire, she is brassy and brash. As Queenie, who cares for the elderly in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, she is deeply tender. As Katherine Johnson in Hidden Figures, one of the groundbreaking African American women working at Nasa who helped put John Glenn into orbit, her humility amplifies the character’s achievements. And much of the charm in What Men Want, her broad and exuberant new romp, comes from her eagerness to act the giddy goat.

She had been in the business for two decades when she won a Golden Globe in 2016 for her work in Empire. Even longer if you count her presence as an extra in Spike Lee’s Malcolm X in 1991 as the real beginning of her screen career, long before films-in-the-hood such as Baby Boy and Hustle & Flow. “Me and my girlfriend were, like, ‘Denzel’s gonna spot us!’ Now why in the hell would Denzel Washington notice us? They had a thousand extras. We were like pepper specks! Nah, that was me saying to myself: ‘One day, I’m gonna be on the Denzel side of things.’” And now she is. Success, though, was a long time coming. As she put it when someone off-stage signalled for her to curtail that barnstorming Golden Globes acceptance speech for her performance in Empire: “Please wrap? I waited 20 years for this. You gonna wait!”

Don’t forget that she had also been up for a best supporting actress Oscar for Benjamin Button in 2009, six years before Empire came along, and even that nomination led mainly to films of only negligible impact (Date Night, The Karate Kid, the Tom Hanks flop Larry Crowne). Somehow, the defining role she needed kept eluding her.

“I don’t think Hollywood quite knew what to do with me. They didn’t grasp my talent. I’m like a musician. Give me the sheet music and I’ll play you anything.” I ask what she has in mind and she starts snatching ideas from the air. “I wanna play a wizard! A warlock! Put makeup on me. Make me a long-nosed witch, some Harry Potter fantasy thing. Take me out of my body. Make me fly. Put me in a muscle suit, a mask, put me in a – I don’t know – a fatsuit. I’ll play Jabba the Hutt. I’ll play anything!”

In that period between Queenie and Cookie, Henson was all set to star as a pregnant sex worker in the comedy St Vincent. The director, Theodore Melfi, had created the part specially for her; Bill Murray would play her grumpy alcoholic chum. But while Melfi may have written the screenplay, Harvey Weinstein was signing the cheques. The producer vetoed her and hired Naomi Watts for the role instead. In a racetrack scene in the finished film, one of the horses is named Harvey Knows Best, which may or may not be sarcastic.

Was Weinstein’s decision a matter of race? “Yeah,” Henson says. “Basically, I don’t think he saw my box-office appeal. What I heard – I didn’t sit down with the man – is that he wanted someone who was known internationally, so they got Naomi Watts.”

How does she feel about his subsequent downfall? “Well, you know, I just sit here and I sip my tea.” A sly smile appears as she does just that. “I never wished anything bad on the man. I was just, like, ‘OK, he’ll see. That’s another person who’ll have to eat crow. How would you like yours? Fried? Toasted?’”

The way she views it, she might never have been cast in Hidden Figures, Melfi’s follow-up, if she hadn’t met him for St Vincent. “That’s how God works. He had a bigger plan.” Now her career looks very different. Or, as she puts it: “I call the shots.” When she hosted Saturday Night Live in 2015, she began her monologue by telling the audience: “This proves, after 20 years in the business, that white people finally know who I am!” But then it had always been her ambition to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. She had often told her son, Marcell, that she wanted to reach beyond the black community. “Then after Baby Boy, a white couple came and spoke to me in a shopping mall. My son was all cool about it, but afterwards he said: ‘Mom! Mom! They weren’t black!’”

What Men Want is the sort of vehicle that only stars get to make: precision-tooled and shaped to the lead’s precise specifications. Coming in the aftermath of Weinstein and #MeToo, it is nothing if not timely. Henson plays a high-powered sports agent who is unfairly overlooked for promotion in favour of a junior male colleague. Her problem, she is told, is that she relates poorly to men. But after her tea is spiked by a fortune teller (the joyfully cuckoo Erykah Badu), she finds she can hear men’s innermost thoughts as clearly as if they were broadcasting them on loudspeaker. It’s a gender-switched spin on What Women Want, the 2000 comedy in which the chauvinist who gains new insights into the opposite sex is played by (oh dear) Mel Gibson. Repurposing it now with an irrepressibly sexual African American woman seems like a fitting act of detoxification.

Henson claims she has already witnessed the effect of #MeToo on her workplace. “It’s all handshakes and stiff arms from guys on set now. Me, I don’t take any of that stuff personally. I can laugh at anything.” In fact, her sense of humour has limits. A year ago, she fired her longtime manager, Vincent Cirrincione, following widespread claims of sexual misconduct against him from young female actors. “We’ve all been through painful things and my defence mechanism is usually to laugh. To beat you to the punch. I’ll laugh at me before you can do it. But catch me on the wrong day and I’ll be like: ‘Bitch, what you say?’”

What Men Want is important, too, in exploiting Henson’s underused knack for slapstick, pratfalls and mania. She learned from the best. “I used to stand in front of our old tube TV as a child, watching Lucille Ball, studying everything she did. I had to be that close to the screen to see exactly how she stomped on the grapes and what faces she pulled, so that I could mimic her. Comedy was my escapism because I lived in the hood.” Adam Shankman, the director of What Men Want, knew that Henson’s mastery of physical comedy would be central to the movie. “I wanted her to approach the part very physically because the movie felt to me like an extremely fast-paced slamming-door farce,” he says. “Also we had a low budget and so I knew Taraji was going to be my special effect. She has this encyclopaedic knowledge of old screwball comedies. I could say to her, ‘Now I need you to be like Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday’ or whatever, and she could just pull it out of the hat.”

Henson points out that comedy was her original calling; it’s what she first came out to Los Angeles to do. One sitcom part followed another before she made a splash as Tyrese Gibson’s long-suffering girlfriend in Baby Boy. “And that was that. Suddenly I was a serious, dramatic actress and people stopped calling me in for comedies, even though I tried to put some funny into everything I did.”

It is as Cookie, a riotous cocktail of Almodóvar matriarch and blaxploitation badass, that she has really had the chance to show her range. The moment she left prison in the pilot episode and announced: “Cookie’s coming home”, it was clear she would be to Empire what James Gandolfini was to The Sopranos, albeit with snazzier threads. From her parole outfit of white fur, clingy leopard-print dress and hoop earrings big enough for a dog to leap through, it has been a constant battle to see which would be the more outrageous – her wardrobe or her behaviour.

“I thought one of my movies would make me a star,” she says. “Not Cookie, who beats her kids with a broom and went to jail for selling crack. Wow. OK, people, that’s what you want?” She thinks the clue to the character’s popularity is her frankness. “She’s all about living your 100% truth.” Could there ever be an Empire without her? “I don’t think so. You kill her off, you’ve killed the mama. What would the boys do without her?”

When I call her three months later, she is in Chicago, where she lives most of the time with her fiance, the former NFL player Kelvin Hayden, and where she is currently on set shooting the sixth season of Empire. She draws a blank when I remind her that we spent an hour together before Christmas (“We did?”), then charmingly makes amends: “Well, it sure is nice to talk to you, uh, again.” And when I tell her I’ve just seen the new film, she seems momentarily confused – “Um, I’m sorry, which film are we talking about?” But that’s understandable: in the midst of shooting Empire, she is also promoting not only What Men Want but also The Best of Enemies, in which she stars as the civil rights activist Ann Atwater, who forged an unlikely friendship with the Ku Klux Klan leader CP Ellis, played by Sam Rockwell.

Besides, a lot has happened since our last meeting. In January, Henson got her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. “I still can’t believe it,” she says during a break on set. “When people mention it, I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, that happened.’”

In the same month, her Empire co-star Jussie Smollett, who plays one of her sons, claimed he was the victim of a hate crime in Chicago. Two men bombarded him with racist and homophobic abuse, then hung a noose around his neck. Last month, the case took a strange turn when Smollett was arrested on suspicion of staging the attack and filing a false police report.

“Jussie’s gonna be just fine,” she says soothingly when I enquire after him. “He’s my sweetheart. I believe him. He’s a victim and he needs to be treated like one.” After we speak, Smollett was charged with filing a false report and could face one to three years in prison.

And only this week, Henson has been lashing out on social media at anyone who criticises The Best of Enemies based on the trailer alone. “They haven’t even seen it!” she splutters. “They just seen me with a white guy in the trailer and they’re projecting all this stuff on to it. Don’t do that! I’m so annoyed. I’m an artist so I’m sensitive about my shit.”

Could this discord about yet another unlikely black/white friendship be connected to the frustration about Green Book winning best picture? “Probably. That’s what I felt it was,” she says.

When I ask if she voted for that film, her response is perfectly diplomatic. “The one I loved was If Beale Street Could Talk. And Bohemian Rhapsody. Look, I was happy for Green Book. Octavia Spencer [one of its executive producers] is a dear friend, and Mahershala Ali is a dope actor.”

Could she understand those who were bothered by the movie? “I guess I can. It maybe feels like the same formula – the white saviour and all that. People are getting tired of the story being told in that way.”

So, will the reign of the old, rich, white man ever come to an end, as What Men Want suggests it could? “I don’t think it’ll come to an end, but there’s room for all sorts of stories, and Hollywood is finally seeing what’s needed. Look at Crazy Rich Asians. I loved that movie. The people on screen might not look like you, but so what? Everyone needs representation. And if the movie’s good, and it has heart, that’s all that matters.” She’s being called back to set now: our time is up. “Empire is waiting for me,” she laughs, all too aware that everyone wants a bite of Cookie.

What Men Want is out next Friday. The Best of Enemies is released this year."

CHICAGO -- Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was attacked.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the investigation began after Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct last month. Investigators say Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself with two men's help and made a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two men hurled slurs and looped a rope around his neck on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago.

Guglielmi says no alleged leakers have been identified so far. He says no officers or staff members with the department have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.

Kelly got plaudits from all over this week, including from Fox News, where The Five co-host Jesse Watters praised the CBS This Morning host for staying calm as the singer and accused child rapist ranted and raved in her face. There was one problem, however.

“Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,” Watters said. His co-host Dana Perino had to correct him. It was Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts who interviewed actor Jussie Smollett after his alleged attack. “Oh, I knew that,” he said before ultimately apologizing for the mix-up.

“Were you happy to hear that Fox News’ Jesse Watters gave you props for this interview after that Jussie Smollett interview you did?” Stephen Colbert asked King during her Late Show victory lap Thursday night.

“Oh my gosh, Stephen,” King said, adding that she only knew about the incident when people starting sending it to her because she normally doesn’t watch Fox News. After that segment aired, she got ahold of Dana Perino’s email and thanked her for correcting Watters.

“I said, ‘Hi, just wanted to thank you for letting your colleague know that Robin Roberts and I—it was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,” King told Colbert. Then, she asked Perino, “Can you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people don’t look alike?”

Earlier in the interview, King told Colbert that the reason she sat there so quietly as R. Kelly stood up and started screaming was because she was worried if she made any sudden movements he may have walked out of the interview.

“I never thought that he was going to hurt me or hit me,” she said. “What I was worried about is that he was flailing and hitting his fists so violently that I thought he could accidentally hit me. But I never thought that he wanted to hurt me in any way.”"

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for “destroying” his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning”. He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, “How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can’t work?”

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had “zero” relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly”, which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a “sex cult.”

Experts said Kelly’s appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That’s why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,” said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said … (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but “historically it’s a bad idea,” Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago.

In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly’s case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

“A lot of the public already thinks he’s guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star “may not know all the evidence against him.”

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she’s 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman’s claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview — but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script.”

“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.

On Wednesday’s broadcast, Kelly’s emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I’m fighting for my (expletive) life.”

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music.”

“I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can’t do it” because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don’t want to believe it.”

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn’t come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly’s finances were “a mess.”

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — also are set to air. Savage’s parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day. CC

Kelly.""

In an exclusive clip that premiered on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" Thursday night, Gayle King asks R. Kelly why he continues to see young women, but Kelly deflects, asking, ""Why do I see continue to see women?"" King says, ""I'm not saying women — you know what I'm talking about,"" but Kelly answers, ""I know older women as well.""

""I know 43 years old, bodies tight, they cool, I go out with them, I kick it with them,"" Kelly said. ""I love women.""

King said she had meant, ""Don't you think, considering your behavior, this isn't good?"" because, King said, the allegations of sexual abuse against Kelly moved away from a ""he said, she said"" to a ""he said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said ...""

King said when she went to interview him, she knew he wasn't going to say, ""You know Gayle, you're right. I've done terrible things,"" but she thought he would have some level of reflection or contrition.

""I think we were witnessing the self-destruction of a man having a breakdown and that's never a good thing to see,"" King remarked to Colbert.

In the days after R. Kelly's explosive, nearly 80-minute interview for ""CBS This Morning,"" some of his sexual abuse accusers have broken their silence about one of the most dramatic parts of his interview, when he jumped to his feet in a burst of emotion, flailing his arms. King, who interviewed him exclusively for CBS News, said she never felt her safety was at risk.

Colbert said everyone is ""marveling"" at King's composure in that moment. King said the now-viral photo of Kelly yelling was taken by a makeup artist who snapped 800 pictures during the interview. King told Colbert she was worried Kelly would storm out of the interview and she thought if she told him to calm down, it would make things worse.

""When I see Robert getting really upset, my initial reaction is 'please don't leave, please don't leave, please don't leave,'"" King said.

Colbert called King's calm ""Robert"" something that was ""instantly legendary."" ""If anyone yells at me for the next year, I'm just going to go 'Robert,'"" Colbert kidded.

King noted that when somebody says your name, it's ""soothing.""

King also addressed how she feels Kelly's legacy and music will hold up over time in wake of the allegations against him.

""'I Believe I Can Fly' is one of my favorites. ... We are hearing it now with different ears. None of these are new allegations,"" King said. ""When you see the people come out the way they're talking ... you can't unhear it.""

R. Kelly accusers react to explosive interview with Gayle King

King said she ""feels his pain, his anger"" but, she said, ""he also knows what he's done.""

Colbert also pointed to one of the notable comments from after the Kelly interview aired: Fox News host Jesse Watters said ""hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the Smollett fiasco,"" seemingly referencing ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts' interview with Jussie Smollett. His co-host Dana Perino pointed out it wasn't King who interviewed Smollett, it was Roberts. ""I apologize,"" Watters said.

King told Colbert she sent an email to Perino to thank her and said it was a ""great compliment"" to be mistaken for Roberts. ""Thank you for letting him know we're two different people and could you let the rest of your colleagues know that all black people do not look alike?""

King's explosive interview with King has been widely discussed since it was broadcast on ""CBS This Morning."" Just hours after the interview aired, court officers in Chicago arrested Kelly Wednesday after a hearing over unpaid child support bills. Authorities said Kelly will stay in jail until he comes up with more than $161,000 he owes his three children.

On Thursday, two of R. Kelly's accusers spoke out about the CBS News interview.

""When he started screaming it terrified me, so when he started screaming I immediately turned the TV (off) because again, I felt like I was revisiting him yelling at me,"" said Asante McGee. She met R. Kelly at a club and they dated from 2014 to 2016.

CBS News also spoke to Kitti Jones, who said she dated Kelly from 2011 to 2013. She said that throughout their relationship, Kelly kicked, slapped and punched her. Jones said Kelly describing his accusers as liars was no surprise.

Kelly remains jailed. Meanwhile, police in Detroit said Wednesday they want to talk to a woman who claims Kelly sexually assaulted her in 2001 when she was 13 years old.

Kelly interview on CBS This Morning. Colbert noted she’d gotten “a lot of props” from other journalists, and asked if she had been happy to hear from Fox News’s Jesse Watters.

Watters was among those who approved of the interview, saying on air, “Hats off to Gayle King for totally redeeming herself after the [Jussie] Smollett fiasco.”

Except Robin Roberts did the Smollett interview, as Fox News’s Dana Perino pointed out to Watters on air.

(Watters apologized, and held up a sign at the end of the broadcast, on which he’d written “I’m sorry Gayle & Robin.”)

King acknowledged she does not watch Fox news “unless I’m curious to see what’s going on, what other people are thinking.”

But people sent her video of the incident, after which she emailed Perino.

“It was a great compliment, but thank you for letting him know that we’re two different people,” she wrote Perino, asking if she could also inform the rest of her colleagues “that all black people do not look alike.”

“Yes – I did,” she assured a tickled Colbert.

King was on for two segments, also talking to Colbert about her interview with the two women currently living with Kelly, and why they seem so “angry.”"

New reports claim the organization has an internal investigation going on to find out who leaked medical details of alleged hate crime victim Jussie Smollett.

According to reports, Chi-Town police are determined to discover who’s responsible.

Sergeant Rocco Alioto of the Chicago P.D. told ET on Thursday that an internal investigation has been opened into who was behind the leaks to the media in theEmpire actor’s investigation. “I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Alioto said in a statement. “As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.” (ET Online)

Recently, rap star Drake‘s dad Dennis Graham spoke up for Smollett amid his publicized attack and rumors suggesting he might have staged it.

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.” (Variety)

According to reports, Jussie’s Jamal Lyon character will noticeably disappear from the upcoming season’s final episodes.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” said EPs Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer in a statement this morning in reference to the supposed assault of January 29 and the subsequent legal fallout. “Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the producers added. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.” (Deadline)

After turning himself in last month, Smollett posted bond and will return to court next week."

Sergeant Rocco Alioto, a Chicago PD spokesperson, released a statement about the investigation.

“I would like to point out that a lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,” Ailoto said.

“As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

Smollett originally claimed he was the target of a racist and homophobic assault carried out by two men. However, in late January he was officially labeled a suspect and indicted on a disorderly conduct felony charge for filing a false police report after two brothers, Olabingo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, cooperated with police and revealed that he had paid them to carry out the attack.

The Chicago PD has encountered some criticism for the manner in which they have dealt with Smollett’s case, particularly because of the amount of information disclosed from police sources.

Smollett maintains his innocence and hired celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos to represent him. Geragos has a star-studded client list that includes Michael Jackson and Colin Kaepernick.

Geragos claimed the police department leaks were an attempt to slander the actor’s reputation. The lawyer previously appeared on CNN and expressed to Anderson Cooper why the Chicago Police Department leaks were concerning.

“Any time you get law enforcement drip-drip-drip leaks, that to me is a telltale sign that something else is going on here,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything except leaks according to law enforcement sources. To me, that screams out somebody is trying to manipulate something.”

Other problems for the Smollett case arose at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago where several employees have been fired for accessing Smollett’s hospital records. Deadline reported that reports show that some of the workers claim they only scrolled past the records and didn’t look at them.

Being a celebrity in a highly publicized criminal case likely placed Smollett’s medical records at considerable risk of being compromised. In 2008, UCLA Medical Center fired at least 13 employees and suspended at least six others for going through Britney Spears’s medical records while she was hospitalized in its psychiatric unit.

Smollett was treated at Northwestern’s emergency room on January 29 after the alleged attack in downtown Chicago. He is due back in court later this month."

Police investigating Empire actor Jussie Smollett's case about filing a false report have now launched an internal probe into the leaking of details over the past couple weeks.

The Chicago Police Department are looking into concerns that specific details about their investigation into 36-year-old Jussie were leaked to the media, causing a 'slew of inaccurate information' going into the pubic domain.

TMZ has reported that the Chief of Detectives started looking into the leaks to find who was passing on information from the department.

A spokesman for Chicago PD said: ""When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.""

The leaks had been brought to the forefront after Jussie's attorney had taken aim at the police for letting information out, which he felt was jeopardising the actor's case.

The investigation had previously been defended by Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson, who has indicated that police believe there is 'overwhelming evidence' that Jussie had paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him.

It has been alleged that the attack was part of a 'staged hate crime' as he looked to force Empire bosses into paying him a higher wage.

Speaking about Jussie's claims that he is innocent, Eddie Johnson said: ""He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.

""I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.""

As well as an investigation into leaks, there have been reports that dozens of nurses were fired from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, for looking at Jussie's medical records.

Speaking about the incident, one nurse told CBS Chicago that she had just scrolled past Jussie's records when looking for another patient's file.

The nurse claimed that others were axed for similar actions, after Jussie had gone to the hospital following the alleged attack on January 29.

The new development comes just hours after news broke that dozens of hospital workers in Chicago were reportedly fired for improperly handling Smollett's medical records.

One nurse, however, said she believes the firing was a miscommunication and is appealing the termination.

The workers were terminated for gaining access to the actor's medical chart when he visited the hospital's emergency room. The nurse claimed the situation was a misunderstanding and that she never accessed the chart. She added that other employees might have been mistakenly fired for the same reason.

Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a crime. The actor was released after posting 10 percent of his $100,000 bond.

The allegations against Smollett come from an alleged attack on the actor, which police now believe to be a hoax orchestrated by Smollett to further his career. Authorities added at the time that prior to the attack, Smollett sent himself a threatening letter, which did not receive the attention he had hoped it would.

Smollett has maintained his innocence and denied all allegations against him, as producers of the FOX drama series made the decision to cut his character off the final two episodes of Season 5 to avoid further production disruptions during the investigation.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

How thoughtful!

So they revamped and passed the whole thing – not mentioning Omar by name – but including many groups of persecuted people. This is how far the Dems have fallen. They can’t even agree to remind people that they don't hate the Jews!

But here's my favorite argument against the resolution: that condemning hate puts the hater in danger!

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who wants to be the Democratic nominee for president, says: “I’m concerned that the spotlight being put on Congresswoman Omar may put her at risk.""

Sorry, senator. The spotlight is what Omar craves. The spotlight is the whole point.

Besides, when the Jussie Smollett hoax took off, did anyone worry about putting Trump supporters in danger? When people said red hats were racist, did anyone care that it put targets on innocent heads? Did anyone care when actual harm was done?

These are trick questions, because the answer is obvious: “Nah.”

By Donna Stewart





On Feb. 22, the San Diego Union-Tribune ran an editorial cartoon that managed to demean the contributions of two American literary and social justice icons in a single panel.



In an attempt to offer commentary on the legal entanglements of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, cartoonist Steve Breen equated the works of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison to the inconsistent account of a hate crime as told by Smollett. Breen titled the cartoon ""Famous African-American Storytellers.""



Although Breen has explained that his intent was to contrast Smollett with Baldwin and Morrison, not to compare them, the effort fell short.



The cartoon suggested that the writings of Morrison, the first African-American woman to win a Nobel Prize for literature are on a similar level as the controversial statements Smollett made about being attacked on the streets of Chicago, an incident police accuse the actor of staging for personal gain.



The image suggests that the works of Baldwin, author of the novel ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" are on par with Smollett's possibly fictional account of racial epithets being hurled at him as a rope was tied around his neck.



There has been intense public outcry from many in the community who found the cartoon offensive, no matter the intent of its creator. For me, this speaks to a larger issue: a lack of diversity in newsrooms around the country and in San Diego in particular.



I have been a journalist for more than 30 years. I am also the president of the San Diego Association of Black Journalists, the local chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists, which since its founding in December 1975 has grown into the country's largest organization of journalists of color.



The SDABJ was founded 19 years ago in the Mission Valley offices of the Union-Tribune. Our mission statement is twofold: to push for diversity at all levels in local news organizations and to make sure that the African-American community is being treated fairly in the media.



Newsrooms are full of people whose job it is to ask questions, to get information and, for those who work in editorial roles, offer educated opinions. A journalist should be able to walk across the newsroom to ask colleagues of diverse backgrounds, ""Hey, I am thinking about this for my comic today. Do you have any thoughts about this?



I am asking because I want to ensure I get my point across while being culturally sensitive."" That kind of conversation is possible only if there is diversity in the newsroom. That conversation is possible only if management demands that type of introspection from its staff.



The challenges faced by journalism today are well-known. It is no secret that several news operations in San Diego, including the Union-Tribune, are trying to do more with less. However, diversity should not be a casualty of those cutbacks. A newsroom lacking diverse voices limits its ability to provide the community with fair and accurate reporting.



According to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, people of color represented 16.6 percent of the workforce in 667 U.S. newsrooms that responded to its diversity survey in 2017. Last year, people of color represented 22.6 percent, with only 293 of 1,700 newsrooms responding.



Editor and Publisher Jeff Light issued an apology shortly after the cartoon was published in the Union-Tribune, and he and others at the news organization have said they are open to discussing solutions to prevent something like this from happening in the future.



The members of SDABJ would like to offer ourselves as a resource. Our local and national organizations are ready and willing to be a conduit for the paper to find qualified talent with diverse voices. We are happy to provide suggestions on ways to improve the dialogue with your staff in order to avoid the unintended consequences such as Mr. Breen experienced.



Harper Lee, author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" wrote in that iconic novel: ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view ... until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" It should always be possible to walk up to another person and talk to them about their experiences. Especially in a newsroom. It's what we do.

According to TMZ on Thursday, Chicago PD‘s Chief of Detectives has launched an internal investigation regarding authorities who may or may not have leaked stories to the media.

Apparently, there has been an enormous amount of “inaccurate” information, and the organization wants to know who is putting it out there.

A spokesperson told the publication:

“When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

Additionally, on Wednesday, CBS Chicago reported that dozens of hospital workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital — where the Empire star was treated after allegedly getting attacked in a hate crime — may have been fired.

Reportedly, the staffers got in trouble for improperly reviewing the actor’s medical records, specifically for gaining access to his medical chart.

One nurse was reportedly axed but claimed it was a misunderstanding, and said she never accessed Smollett’s chart. Apparently, last Tuesday, she was called in at the end of her shift, was fired on the spot, and was escorted out of the hospital. She said she was not asked any questions, and never had a chance to offer an explanation.

On January 29, Smollett claimed he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when two offenders yelled racial and homophobic slurs, and then attacked him.

Last month, he was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report related to the alleged incident. He was later released on $100,000 bond.

Chicago PD alleged the 36-year-old orchestrated the incident because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on his Fox show. They also alleged he paid Ola and Abel Osundairo — who worked on Empire — to assist.

However, last month, a TMZ source said the 36-year-old paid the two to train him for five weeks for an upcoming music video. Allegedly, the thespian wanted abs like Ola, so the brothers agreed to work out with him, as well as give him a 5-week nutrition plan.

When Smollett wrote the alleged check for $3500 days before the “attack,” the memo line allegedly read, “5 weeks training nutrition plan.” The brothers also reportedly told the Grand Jury they were paid for the gym sessions — NOT for the “attack.”

Jussie has plead not guilty.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

CHICAGO POLICE BLAST JUSSIE SMOLLETT 'PHONY ATTACK': 'BOGUS POLICE REPORTS CAUSE REAL HARM'

In January, Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a sandwich shop in the early morning on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before fleeing.

But that isn't how police say it all went down.

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. After turning himself in, a judge set Smollett's bond for $100,000 and he was released from jail. If convicted, he will face up to three years behind bars.

'EMPIRE' ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S BOND SET AT $100G, JUDGE CALLS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM 'OUTRAGEOUS'

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the ""check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]"" to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 ""for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.""

He said the attack ""was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) 'staged attack' where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS BLAST AUTHORITIES, SAY ACTOR WAS 'BETRAYED BY A SYSTEM THAT WANTS TO SKIP DUE PROCESS'

Smollett has maintained his innocence. The actor's legal counsel told Fox News after Smollett was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his team continued.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Kelly's woes continue

R. Kelly's troubles are deepening as he is jailed for outstanding child support payments which he says he is unable to make.

STILL COOL: Musician R. Kelly arrives at the Daley Centre for a hearing in his child support case. PHOTOS: NAMPA/AP NOT SO COOL: R. Kelly was booked into jail for outstanding maintenance payments.

R. Kelly's Wednesday began with a nationally televised broadcast in which he whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe him: He'd never had sex with anyone under 17 and never held anyone against her will.



The day ended with a trip to jail after the embattled R&B singer told a judge he could not pay US$161 000 in back child support he owes his children's mother.



Kelly no doubt hoped the raw interview aired Wednesday on 'CBS This Morning' would help sway public opinion about the charges filed last month that accuse him of sexually abusing three girls and a woman. The interview was his first public defence since being charged and the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime series 'Surviving R. Kelly', which aired in January. The documentary alleged that he held women captive and ran a “sex cult”.



More of the interview was aired yesterday.







Bad idea



But experts said his appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That's why most defence attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.



“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defence,” said Illinois appellate judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said ... (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”



There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but, Birkett said, “Historically, it's a bad idea”.



One recent example was 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC's 'Good Morning America' identifying two people in a still photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. Two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career.



In Kelly's case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.



“A lot of the public already thinks he's guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.







Denials



But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defence, Thiagarajah said. “He may not know all the evidence against him.”



In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15, and a videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she's 14. Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls.



Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview - but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script”.



“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.



On Wednesday's broadcast, Kelly's emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.



In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I'm fighting for my (expletive) life.”



He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music”.



“I'm trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can't do it” because of the sex-abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don't want to believe it.”



Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson, who said Kelly was prepared to pay US$50 000 to US$60 000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.







Pay up first



A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child-support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for March 13.



After his February 22 arrest in Chicago, Kelly spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his US$100 000 bail. His defence attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were “a mess”.



Following the court hearing, the publicist said that the singer “feels good” about the TV interview.



CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview aired yesterday.



Interviews with two women who live with Kelly - Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary – also aired yesterday. Savage's parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.



A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.







'I did wrong'



“At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,” attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.



Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done “lots of things wrong” when it comes to women, but he said he had apologised. The singer blamed social media for fuelling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.



The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centred on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.



He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.



Rising from poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, '12 Play', which produced such popular sex-themed songs as 'Your Body's Callin' and 'Bump N' Grind'. He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is 'I Believe I Can Fly'.

Edward Wodnicki, chief of detectives for CPD’s Area Central, started the probe after disorderly conduct charges were filed against the actor in February after a nearly month-long investigation that began when Smollett reported he had been attacked by two men in Streeterville early on Jan. 29 who beat Smollett and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Police and prosecutors now say Smollett paid brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to stage the attack as part of a plan to raise Smollett’s public profile and increase his salary on the Fox TV drama. Smollett has pleaded not guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the CPD leak investigation.

No alleged leakers have so far been identified, Guglielmi said, and no CPD officers or staff have been disciplined for releasing information about the case.

Smollett’s account of the attack immediately sparked questions, if not from Chicago Police, then among the public. Skepticism about Smollett’s claims also permeated social media.

Guglielmi said it would be difficult to identify the sources based on the number of people outside the department who may have had access to case details throughout the investigation: evidence technicians from the State Police; prosecutors; the federal law enforcement agencies; even staff in the court clerk’s office who processed warrants."

“Students are commonly told now that words are literally violent and can be responded to with physical force,” Williams writes. “I don’t mean verbal threats of violence or efforts to intimidate, I mean words that express ideas that the listener finds offensive or disagrees with.”

The result: “Increasingly, leftists believe they are justified to respond to ideas disagreeable to them with open hostility and even force.”

The man charged with assaulting him — who pleaded not guilty Wednesday, despite video evidence and corroborating eyewitness accounts of his violent actions — felt empowered to use physical force to suppress a minority viewpoint on campus, conservatism, Williams suggest.

“The message that provoked my attacker was our sign that read ‘Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,’ a reference to the recent case of Jussie Smollett, who was charged by Chicago police with filing a false police report about an apparently fictitious attack,” Williams explains. “My attacker said we were promoting violence, which, in his view, gives him permission to use any means necessary to shut us down. The irony is that the sign was intended to warn of the danger of disregarding facts and jumping to judgment in an effort to confirm a narrative our feelings tell us is true.”

What happened to him at the student-filled plaza was just another example of what is taking place in one form or another all over the country, Williams suggested. “As a field representative for the Leadership Institute, I travel to campuses throughout California helping conservative clubs recruit and train new members,” he writes. “I’ve seen the intolerance and hate toward conservatives on our campuses with my own eyes, and the only difference between what happened to me on Feb. 19 and every other day is that the event was caught on video.”

“The Berkeley administration in particular,” Williams adds, “has allowed a culture of intolerance and violence toward conservatives to grow. The College Republicans club has had its property vandalized, and critics have called for the members to be lynched. When there was a pro-Trump rally in April 2017, a former community college professor was arrested for allegedly assaulting multiple supporters with a bike lock.”

One employee even tweeted, then deleted the following statement about the assault on Williams: “The MAGA people on UC Berkeley campus yesterday got punched in the face by someone this makes me feel emotionally so much better.” (Read Williams’ op-ed here.)

On Wednesday, the suspect in the attack, former Berkeley student and employee Zachary Greenberg, pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault, battery, and criminal threats. Video footage of the attack, taken by a witness and Williams himself, has gone viral. Below is a compilation video of the footage from Campus Reform, whose parent company is the Leadership Institute. In the video, Greenberg can be seen repeatedly shoving Williams, punching him in the face, and threatening to “shoot” him.

The attack took place while Williams was working with Turning Point USA to help recruit students. TPUSA founder and president Charlie Kirk, who helped bring national attention to the attack by tweeting out the initial video footage, issued a statement a few days later condemning Greenberg’s actions and calling out the media for failing to give the attack the same kind of coverage it would have if a conservative assaulted a liberal.

“This assault reveals the hate and anger so many on the left harbor and that our student activists encounter on a daily basis,” said Kirk. “Our amazing grassroots organizers courageously face threats of violence and discrimination as they fight for the right for conservative voices to be heard on college campuses. I am proud of how our student activists at UC Berkeley comported themselves in what was a very scary and difficult situation. Sadly, if the roles were reversed and a conservative student wearing a MAGA hat had attacked a member of a leftist organization, the story would be a leading headline on the nightly news across all major networks.”

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for “destroying” his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after the R&B star was jailed for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is charged with sexually abusing three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning.” He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse, and his voice broke as he asked, “How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can’t work?”

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he could not afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had “zero” relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, he ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a “sex cult.”

Experts said Kelly’s appearance was risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That’s why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,” said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said … (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but “historically it’s a bad idea,” Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors say.

In Kelly’s case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

“A lot of the public already thinks he’s guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locks himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding that the star “may not know all the evidence against him.”

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she’s 14. And police in Detroit were looking into a woman’s claims that Kelly had sex with her in that city in 2001 when she was 13.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls. He was not immediately available Thursday to comment on the Detroit allegations.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview — but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script.”

“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.

On Wednesday’s broadcast, Kelly’s emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I’m fighting for my (expletive) life.”

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music.”

“I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can’t do it” because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don’t want to believe it.”

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn’t come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly’s finances were “a mess.”

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly — Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary — also are set to air. Savage’s parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying on Wednesday that Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

The Chicago Police Department has launched an internal probe into Jussie Smollett's case after information was leaked during the course of the investigation.

The investigation was recently opened by the Chicago PD's Chief of Detectives due to concerns that someone within the force was leaking the information.

Investigators indicated that 'inaccurate' information about the Smollett case made its way into the media and the department wants to determine how it got out.

'A lot of the information out there was inaccurate and there were numerous agencies involved in this investigation,' a Chicago PD spokesman said.

'As a standard procedure when there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.'

Smollett's attorney has previously slammed the police department over its investigation and claimed the leaks were an attempt to skewer the Empire actor.

Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson has previously defended the department's investigation into the attack and condemned Smollett after the actor was charged with filing a false police report.

Police say they have overwhelming evidence Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him on January 29 in a staged hate crime because he wanted a higher salary.

Smollett maintains he is innocent and claims he was attacked by homophobic, racist assailants who shouted: 'This is MAGA country!' while beating him, putting a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him.

The Superintendent has batted away Smollett's claim that a $3,500 check for the brothers he allegedly paid to attack him was for personal training and said there was surveillance footage, physical evidence and testimony that proves it was a hoax that is yet to be presented.

'He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,' Johnson said, rejecting Smollett's lawyers claim that he has been unfairly vilified by the police department and prosecutor's office.

'I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.

It comes as dozens of nurses claim they were fired for looking at Smollett's medical records after he was treated in the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on January 29.

One nurse told CBS Chicago that she was merely scrolling past Smollett's record to get to another patient's file.

They said hospital bosses still fired them and that others received similar treatment.

Smollett, who will return to court March 14 to face a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly making the entire story up, went to the hospital in the early hours of the morning on January 29 after speaking to police.

He had some scratches and bruising on his face and also claimed to have bruises on his ribs."

It’s as simple as that.

If the back and forth coverage of the Jussie Smollett case hasn’t reached your ears yet, it’s important that you understand what has taken place and the importance of every puzzle piece in this gigantic, disgusting mess.

On Jan. 22, 2019, according to the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Police Department was investigating claims by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett that he was attacked by two men after 2 a.m. in Chicago when leaving a Subway restaurant.

Smollett claimed that they approached him, yelling racial and homophobic slurs, shouted “This is MAGA country!” hit him and wrapped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. This attack came after a letter was delivered to the production studio where “Empire” is shot that contained similarly threatening language.

When the news of Smollett’s alleged attack hit social media, the messages of support and concern came in like tidal waves. Everyone from U.S. Senator Kamala Harris to Ellen DeGeneres spoke about the incident online and shared support for Smollett. Everyone was on his side.

Then the narrative started to change.

The commentary online shifted. People were now saying that they believed the attack hadn’t taken place. Smollett did an interview with Robin Roberts of Good Morning America where he addressed those claims.

He said, “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this. I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I so resent that narrative. I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Things moved quickly after that. Rumors were flying that Smollett’s character would be written off “Empire” while the Chicago Police Department was investigating exactly what took place and interviewing persons of interest.

Here’s where we stand now: On Feb. 21, Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago Police, was booked and had his mug shot taken. He was charged with filing a false police report now that evidence had surmounted that proved he had arranged the staging of his attack.

The image of Smollett, defeated, standing in front of a white brick wall of the police station spread around social media like rapid fire.

In a matter of a month, the story of the attack had done a complete 180 and Smollett was no longer the victim but the perpetrator.

It is important to understand that Smollett is a member of two minority communities: the black community and the LGBT community.

The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States, reported a 17 percent increase in hate crimes against the LGBT community based on FBI reported data.

NBC News reported that in November 2018 that black Americans are the most frequently reported group for victims of hate crimes. Janell Ross wrote, “violence, property crimes, threats and other offenses inspired by racial animus amounted to the most frequent type of hate crime reported in the FBI’s most recent tally of bias crimes. In fact, black Americans have been the most frequent victims of hate crime in every tally of bias incidents generated since the FBI began collecting such data in the early 1990s.”

The facts and figures are right there. Hate crimes are prevalent with LGBT and black people as victims. Smollett crying wolf draws attention away from the real crimes taking place every day.

For Smollett to go on national television and declare it offensive for people not to believe him doesn’t make sense. It’s offensive for him to call victim simply because he believed he wasn’t being paid enough.

Hate crimes are a serious matter and in a more political separated environment, it is important that we separate the real from the fake.

In his statements to the press on the investigation, Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson summed up the magnitude of Smollett’s actions. “I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”

The real crimes identify the cracks in our culture where we don’t have respect for each other.

The fake crimes separate us further as it turns into a blame game and who is right and wrong. In this case, the falsity of these crimes have allowed for unfair criticism of the city of Chicago and the treatment of its citizens.

As a black LGBT individual with a following and fame, Smollett would have had the star power to advocate for his communities and bring attention to matters of discrimination and access.

Jussie Smollett has let his communities down in a time where they needed him most.

Kelly angrily blamed his ex-wife for “destroying” his name and claimed other people stole from his bank accounts during new portions of an interview that aired Thursday, a day after he was sent to jail for not paying child support.

Kelly, who is also facing felony charges that allege he sexually abused three girls and a woman in Chicago years ago, shouted and cried as he spoke with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning.” He said his ex-wife was lying when she accused him of domestic abuse and his voice broke as he asked: “How can I pay child support if my ex-wife is destroying my name and I can’t work?”

The 52-year old singer was jailed Wednesday after he said he couldn’t afford to pay $161,000 in back child support. He said he had “zero” relationship with his three children but knows they love him.

The interview, which was recorded earlier this week, marked the first time Kelly has spoken publicly since his arrest last month in the sexual abuse case. In segments that aired Wednesday, Kelly whispered, cried and ranted while pleading with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will – likely hoping the raw interview would help sway public opinion.

The interview also marked the first time he addressed allegations in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in January and alleged he held women captive and ran a “sex cult.”

Experts said Kelly’s appearance was also risky and could backfire if it gives prosecutors more information to use against him at trial. That’s why most defense attorneys urge clients to keep quiet.

“In my history as a prosecutor, I loved it when a defendant would say things or make comments about his or her defense,” said Illinois Appellate Judge Joseph Birkett, who said he did not watch the Kelly interview and was speaking only as a former prosecutor. “I would document every word they said … (and) I could give you example after example where their statements backfired.”

There have been cases in which people who spoke up pointed to evidence that ultimately helped win their freedom, but “historically it’s a bad idea,” Birkett said.

A recent example of where such an interview might have done more harm than good was in the case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with falsely reporting a racist, anti-gay attack against him in Chicago. In charging documents, prosecutors cited statements he made during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” identifying two people in a photo of the surveillance video as his attackers. The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors allege.

In Kelly’s case, he and his attorney might have decided they had nothing to lose after the Lifetime series, said Fred Thiagarajah, a prominent Newport Beach, California, attorney and former prosecutor.

“A lot of the public already thinks he’s guilty, and there is a very negative image of him, so the only thing he might think he can do is try to change their minds,” Thiagarajah said. If the evidence against him is overwhelming, “this kind of interview might be kind of a Hail Mary” to influence a potential jury pool.

But the dangers of such an interview might outweigh any benefits if Kelly locked himself into a particular defense, Thiagarajah said, adding: “He may not know all the evidence against him.”

In the CBS interview, for example, he denied ever having sex with anyone under 17, even though he married the late singer Aaliyah when she was 15. A videotape given to prosecutors in his current case purports to show Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly says she’s 14.

Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, has said his client did not “knowingly” have sex with underage girls.

Thiagarajah said he might allow a client to do such an interview – but only if he were confident the client could keep his emotions in check and “stick to a script.”

“If you get someone who is ranting and raving, I would never let that kind of person ever do an interview,” he said.

On Wednesday’s broadcast, Kelly’s emotions swung wildly as he explained he was simply someone with a “big heart” who was betrayed by liars who hoped to cash in.

In a particularly dramatic moment, he angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled, “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” He cried as he hit his hands together, saying, “I’m fighting for my (expletive) life.”

He insisted people were trying to ruin his 30-year career, but then said his fight was “not about music.”

“I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids and I can’t do it” because of the sexual abuse allegations, he shouted. “You all just don’t want to believe it.”

Hours later, Kelly went to the child-support hearing “expecting to leave. He didn’t come here to go to jail,” said his publicist, Darryll Johnson. Johnson said Kelly was prepared to pay as much as $60,000. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays the full child support debt. His next hearing was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Kelly spent a weekend in jail after his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defense attorney said at the time that Kelly’s finances were “a mess.”

After Wednesday’s hearing, the publicist said that the singer “feels good” about the TV interview.

Interviews with two women who live with Kelly – Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary – also are set to air. Savage’s parents insist she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that her parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer representing the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years. They spoke later that day.

“At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,” attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

Kelly acknowledged in the interview that he had done “lots of things wrong” when it comes to women, but he said he had apologized. The singer blamed social media for fueling the allegations against him. He also said that all of his accusers are lying.

The 52-year-old recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He has pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Rising from poverty on Chicago’s South Side, Kelly broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, “12 Play,” which produced such popular sex-themed songs as “Your Body’s Callin'” and “Bump N’ Grind.” He has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. One of his best-known hits is “I Believe I Can Fly.”

Dozens of workers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital may have been fired for improperly reviewing the medical records of Jussie Smollett, who was treated at the emergency room after he claimed he had been attacked by two men… One of the nurses said it was a misunderstanding, and claimed she never even accessed Smollett’s chart, but she was fired last week and believes many other nurses and staffers were fired for the same reason. The nurse said she was called in at the end of her shift last Tuesday, fired on the spot and escorted out of the hospital. She said she wasn’t asked any questions and never had a chance to offer an explanation. She said she never accessed the actor’s chart, but simply scrolled past it when looking for another patient’s name.

The Chicago Sun-Times has a companion story which is a bit hard to parse. I honestly can’t tell if the administrator in this story is the same person CBS 2 reported on or the person who gave the nurse the fake name under which Smollett had been checked in:

The day Smollett was at the hospital, his arrival and the alleged attack were all over the news, the worker said. An employee in another department came to her desk and asked if Smollett been admitted under an alias, the worker said, adding that she didn’t ask why the information was needed because she believed it to be a professional request. A few weeks later, the worker was called to a meeting with her boss and a representative from human resources, the worker said. “They called it a ‘huge breach,’ and I said, ‘If that’s the case, don’t you think it’s a training issue?’” the worker said.

This isn’t the only drama happening today related to information about Jussie Smollett. TMZ is reporting that the Chicago PD has opened an internal investigation to find out who has been leaking so much fake news about the case to the media:

Chicago PD tells us its Chief of Detectives opened the investigation out of concerns the force was leaking like a sieve. CPD adds there’s been a ton of “inaccurate” info in the media, and they want to know who’s putting it out there. A police spokesman tells TMZ … “When there are allegations of information being leaked, an internal investigation has been opened and we are also looking at our vulnerabilities.”

Chicago PD are probably trying to get ahead of the inevitable attempts by Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos to present police as out to get his client. In addition to representing Smollett, Geragos is also currently working for Colin Kaepernick."
