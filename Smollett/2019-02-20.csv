Take New York’s own Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who on Monday told a bar full of Iowans: “I have the record to show I stand up for what’s right. I do what’s right even if it costs me everything.”

“Costs me everything”? This scion of a famed Democratic machine has never sacrificed for anything — not as a top lawyer for Big Tobacco, nor as a tough-on-immigration, pro-gun-rights member of the House, nor when she “evolved” to the opposite views.

For Gillibrand, “what’s right” means whatever’s politically convenient.

Then there’s Sen. Kamala Harris, who reacted to news of the alleged Jussie Smollett hoax by seeming to forget her own tweets.

When the “Empire” actor claimed he’d been victimized by two racist, homophobic men in MAGA hats, Harris took to Twitter to call it “an attempted modern day lynching. . . We must confront this hate.”

After reports broke that Smollett apparently staged the whole thing, a reporter asked Harris about her comments. And she . . . turned to her staff to ask, “What tweet?”

That’s either a convenient lapse of memory — or an admission that “her” Twitter feed is a staff-written fake.

Anyway, she then took a long pause before declaring, “The facts are still unfolding” and she wouldn’t comment on the case until the investigation is finished — a rule that, after years as a prosecutor, she had to have known she should follow from the start.

At this rate, the standouts in the race for the Democratic nomination will be the few who aren’t utter phonies."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about being attacked on the street, according to Chicago police.

In a tweet early Thursday, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that Smollett ""is under arrest and in custody of detectives."" The actor and musician now faces felony criminal charges from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, which has accused him of ""Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.""

In a statement released Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson vowed to ""mount an aggressive defense.""

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Pugh and Henderson said.

The news of Smollett's arrest marks the latest development in a story of controversy and confusion since that began late last month.

Initially, Chicago police revealed that the actor, who is black and gay and portrays a gay character on Empire, had reported suffering a vicious assault while walking downtown in the early morning hours. According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

The assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a ""possible hate crime,"" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.

The unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.

Early in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as ""potential suspects"" — only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, ""new evidence"" that arose during their interrogations ""had shifted"" the investigation.

And they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.

All the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack — rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having ""no evidence"" — the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.

""At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

Smollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.

According to the FBI's ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,"" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.

In 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.

His Latest Book Is', 'Wnd Staff', 'Wnd News Services', 'Erin Coates', 'The Western Journal', 'C. Douglas Golden', 'Ryan Foley']",,"['held', 'accountable', 'jan', 'attack', 'chicago', 'staged', 'public', 'having', 'incident', 'race', 'smollett', 'jussie']","When black singer, actor and gay activist Jussie Smollett was allegedly assaulted in Chicago on Jan. 29, the act was widely denounced across the political continuum. While those of more measured rhetoric called for the prosecution of those involved, many prominent leftists immediately blamed the incident on a culture of intolerance that, they say, is being advanced by President Donald Trump.

Once upon a time, those in the public eye took great care with regard to what they said in public, if only as a point of credibility. Things aren't always as they appear, and being seen as having rushed to judgment during a media firestorm just doesn't speak to one's intelligence. Despite this, very few of those alleging a Trump connection to the Smollett attack exercised such restraint; histrionics ruled the day once this story broke.

Now, when the Jussie Smollett story did break, there were some who considered the possibility that the attack had been staged, either by leftist operatives or by Smollett himself, in order to lend credence to the threadbare claim that America is an institutionally racist nation and that having elected a bigot like Trump proved this. Very few who courted this idea articulated their hypotheses, and those who did were rather low key about it.

Why would anyone think that Smollett or the politically kindred might stage such an attack, particularly considering the prevailing sensitivities in America around issues of race and intolerance in general? Because given the left's track record, this is precisely the sort of craven, deceitful act that is in keeping with their sinister character.

As many are now aware, the Smollett story began to unravel over the weekend when the news of Chicago police examining new evidence connected to the alleged assault came to the fore. It quickly became evident – unless we have a really elaborate conspiracy within a conspiracy here – that Jussie Smollett himself paid two extras from his Fox TV show ""Empire"" to carry out the ""attack,"" expressly to gin up racial tensions attendant to the current campaign against the president and his supporters.

So let's say we acknowledge that Smollett is an individual of low character simply because he's a dedicated lefty. Why would someone who's secured an enviable position in such a competitive industry court the ignominy of having been beaten up on the street, as well as being condemned as a hate-crime hoaxer should his perfidy be discovered?

Let not those of us who condemn the left for their summary and cavalier appraisal of others (particularly us) fall short in our understanding of what makes them tick.

Once again, we must look to character. Jussie Smollett has been in the entertainment business since he was 10 years old, acting in many films such as ""The Mighty Ducks"" and Rob Reiner's ""North."" As I have attested from personal experience, those who become ensconced in that insular entertainment industry bubble from an early age often become singularly scary people. The tragic lives and deaths of many once-popular child stars stands as testimony to this fact. Those who survive can become even scarier with regard to their worldview and perceptions of themselves.

Thus, it isn't too difficult to see how a popular but perhaps deeply insecure young actor might choose two aspects of his public persona – his ethnicity and his sexual orientation – and qualify them in such a manner as to engender public sympathy. Further, to do so in a way that would advance a favored political agenda.

In support of this argument, it is now being reported by news sources in Chicago that Smollett's motivation for staging the ""attack"" may have been the failure of an earlier staged incident to gain the desired media traction. Apparently (according to CBS 2 Chicago), a letter containing a white powder of some sort addressed to Smollett was delivered to a Chicago set where ""Empire"" was filming just days before the Jan. 29 staged assault.

At this point, even some of the prominent lefties who supported Smollett have articulated their disgust with his alleged actions, and I applaud them for this. There are good reasons why our nation holds certain sensitivities around race, and it's because many good people have sacrificed over many years to improve race relations and conditions for the once-disenfranchised. A spoiled, middle-class puke like Smollett wouldn't be aware of this, partly because he wasn't around at that time, and because accurate representations of our history are no longer taught in schools.

Smollett has now ""lawyered-up,"" expressing the requisite outrage and mortification through his attorneys and pointing to his further victimization via accusations that he orchestrated the assault.

An attack such as the one Smollett claimed was perpetrated upon him is a serious crime that carries heavy penalties. Fraudulently reporting such a crime is also a criminal offense, with very good reason. The potential for dangerous escalation in the wake of such charges is very real.

It has become abundantly clear in recent years that laws, rules and ethics hold no sway over those on the left. Those quaint conventions are for the ""little people,"" not them. This of course would provide further motivation for Smollett having staged the incident, but it also gives rise to the question of whether or not he will be held accountable in any manner if he is indeed found to be culpable.

While the Chicago authorities and the FBI are said to be investigating the ""white powder"" letter and the Jan. 29 attack, there's no telling whether or not these will lead to a just disposition. In the meantime, the producers of ""Empire"" and the network (Fox Broadcasting) announced this week that they intend to keep Smollett on as a series regular."

When the news of the attack first broke, it was terrifying. It felt like the mounting hostility toward the LGBTQ community (and the increase of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes) was being writ large for a widespread audience that can typically overlook it very easily.

Immediately, folks came out of the woodwork to question the story. Strangers, people I’ve long lost contact with, people I’ve purposefully distanced myself from because of their record of insensitive remarks were suddenly all up in my timeline eager to write the whole thing off as “fake news.” In hindsight, the skepticism feels justified, but considering the information available at the time, it was little more than a lucky guess.

After a lifetime of witnessing marginalized people be silenced, I bristled at the (often straight, often white) voices eagerly leaping to discredit his story. I’m using the word “discredit” very purposefully. They weren’t disproving, because they had no additional information than you or I or the Chicago Police Department. There was just something about this man — this black, gay man — they found inherently untrustworthy. It was a bad-faith argument I struggled to sit idly by and let stand.

All across social media, LGBTQ people, people of color and allies rushed to Jussie’s defense, myself included. In most cases, it more closely resembled “wait and see” rather than “BURN THE WITCH!” but even the suggestion that maybe we should wait until we have all the information before we label this potential victim of a hate crime a liar was enough to draw ire from the conservative keyboard warriors.

As the story continued to take twists and turns, things looked grim. In whispered conversations at bars, in DMs, in group texts, I privately fretted with my fellow queer community over the potential damage this could do if it turned out to be false. It’s beginning to look increasingly like this is the reality.

Now, queer people overall are feeling guilt, shame and humiliation for standing by him — especially in the face of the gleeful smugness of people so eager to throw an “I told you so” at them.

F*ck that.

I do not purport to ever speak for anyone other than myself. For me, I have made a decision about my personal values that I will believe victims. Period. Full stop. I understand there is a risk in that, but I sleep much better at night with that risk than with the alternative.

Now, that does not mean rushing through logic or reason. That does not mean demanding consequences without evidence. It is not guilty until proven innocent. It is merely operating in good faith under the belief that a victim is telling the truth until proven otherwise to (hopefully) dismantle a system that puts a terrible burden on victims and discourages people to come forward, thus creating a significantly less just world.

I do not feel any regret for supporting Jussie until proven otherwise. You cannot make me feel shame for having compassion. You cannot fault me for following the lead of the Chicago PD while they also repeatedly refuted claims it was a hoax and treated Jussie as a victim. (Funny how everyone is so pro-law enforcement unless they are running counter to your preferred narrative/investigating your politicians.)

I am angry that someone who should’ve known better could do something so grotesque. We all are. If it turns out this was hoax, I believe what he did was indefensible, and he should have consequences for falsifying a police report and causing immeasurable harm to the LGBTQ community. However, there is such a rush to use this bizarre and terrible story to somehow discredit LGBTQ communities and allies or suggest widespread hypocrisy and conspiracy. The thing is, in light of the truth behind Jussie’s story being revealed, the condemnation will be swift, and I would go as far to call it universal.

Can the same be said for Alex Jones’ unfounded, disgusting crusade to discredit the victims of Sandy Hook? What about the conspiracy about how Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring out of a pizza shop basement that led to a man firing a rifle in the restaurant? Or how about the woman that accused an Obama supporter of carving a B on her face? Moreover, what about our current President’s obsession with the validity of Obama’s citizenship?

If folks are so concerned with the MAGA brand being unfairly associated with anti-LGBTQ sentiment, perhaps more energy should be directed at the official party platform which opposes marriage equality, affirms conversion therapy, supports adoption agencies rejecting same-sex parents, etc. That’s not rumor nor innuendo; that’s official party platform you can read on the official GOP website.

Even more explicitly, a West Virginia lawmaker — wearing a MAGA hat, no less — suggested he would drown his own children if they were gay. That was this month.

I am terrified about what this could mean for the many, many (many, many, many) actual LGBTQ victims of violence and how much harder this will be for them. Queer people were so deeply affected by this because it struck so close to home. I personally have been threatened with violence or death for being gay more times than I can count. And in so many ways, I am lucky.

There are so many LGBTQ people who aren’t so fortunate. Look no further than Matthew Shepard. Look no further than Brandon Teena. Look no further than Regina Denise Brown, Keanna Mattel, Tydi Dansbury, Ciara Minaj Carter, Nikki Janelle Enriquez, Londonn Moore, Shantee Tucker, Dejanay Stanton, Vontashia Bell, Sasha Garden, Keisha Wells, Cathalina Christina James, Diamond Stephens, Antash’a Devine Sherrington English, Gigi Pierce, Nino Fortson, Karla Patricia Flores-Pavón, Sasha Wall, Amia Tyrae, Phylicia Mitchell, Zakaria Fry, Celine Walker, Tonya Harvey, Crista Leigh Steele-Knudslien, Viccky Gutierrez and the countless other trans people (and especially trans people of color) whose lives have been taken over the years.

I sincerely hope all of you armchair investigators are just as passionate about finding justice for them as you’ve been to prove Jussie wrong.

The attorneys' statement was the first disseminated on behalf of Smollett since he was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,"" said Smollett's lawyers in a statement released to press. ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Smollett made headlines last month after claiming he was attacked by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, while also placing a noose around his neck. Following a lengthy investigation, however, Chicago police determined Smollett allegedly orchestrated the assault and paid two men a reported $3,500 to stage the incident.

""Bogus police reports do real harm,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a Thursday morning press conference. ""They do harm to every real victim who is in need of police assistance.""

Johnson, who called the incident ""a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve,"" also lamented the media attention on the case which resulted from Smollett's celebrity. ""I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because that's who really deserves the amount of attention that we're giving to this particular incident,"" he said.

According to police, Smollett was ""dissatisfied"" with his Empire salary, but that claim has also come into question as well: sources told The Hollywood Reporter Smollett didn't express unhappiness with his compensation on the show.

After being released from jail, Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire, reported PEOPLE. But on Friday, it was revealed Smollett won't appear in the show's final episodes. ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" the show's executive producers, including Lee Daniels, Danny Strong and Brian Grazer, said in a statement. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Previously, representatives for Twentieth Century Fox Television, which had previously stood behind the actor, said the company was considering its options concerning Smollett. ""We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.""

While Smollett's future involvement with Empire remains unclear, at least one show parted ways with the actor in the wake of his arrest. Jensen Karp, an executive producer on TNT's Drop the Mic, tweeted that a planned episode with Smollett and Clay Aiken will no longer air.

Shortly after police announced Smollett's arrest on Thursday, President Trump came after the actor via Twitter. Tagging the actor, the president wrote, ""what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA."" In his initial description of the incident, Smollett had alleged that his attackers shouted the pro-Trump phrase ""MAGA country,"" in reference to Trump's slogan, ""Make America great again.""

Trump's only other public mention of Smollett came last month after the incident was first reported. ""I can tell you that it's horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" Trump said during a press conference.

Earlier on Thursday morning, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi announced on Twitter that Smollett had been taken into custody. A mug shot of the actor, seen below, was later released.

The news came a day after Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, ""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

Smollett's attorneys released the following statement regarding the charges: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Earlier Wednesday, Guglielmi confirmed that Smollett was being classified as a suspect in the investigation of his alleged attack, tweeting, ""Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.""

The charges follow reports of evidence that Smollett paid the two brothers involved in the alleged attack on him.

Smollett's attorney previously denied those accusations, stating: ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying... Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate.""

Cable news has since gone wall-to-wall with the latest twist in the Smollett case, with Fox News Channel's ""The Five"" discussing it at length during the roundtable opinion program Wednesday evening.



""I don't see how what he did is not considered a hate crime, because it actually would have hurt a group of people,"" said Gutfeld.



""All Trump supporters,"" injected co-host Jesse Watters. ""Millions of Americans.""



""This is a hate crime, and to your point, that's despicable,"" Gutfeld continued. ""That he would have let two people go to jail. He should go away for a minimum 20 years.""



""People accuse people like me of dunking on the libs over this. No, what you're seeing is vindication,"" he added. ""Remember, us, the people who aren't liberals, are vindicated. Because any kind of tangential link to Trump, you, if you don't believe this story, then you're part of the problem. Everybody should be pleased that a hate crime didn't happen. Because it means we're less racist than the media wants us to be.""

The potential charge against Smollett — filling a false police report — is considered a Class-4 felony. The New York Post's Page Six noted that under Illinois law he could face up to three years in prison if charged and convicted of a crime.

Federal investigators also investigated a threatening letter addressed to Smollett that arrived at a Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is based. The letter included white powder and racist language.

The powder was later found to be a crushed painkiller medication. Legal experts say federal prosecutors could also pursue charges of mail fraud if it is determined Smollett sent the letter to himself."

If Smollett is found culpable of staging a hoax, he will not be alone — he will join the ranks of other liberal public figures who made it big using hoaxes.

Rev. Al Sharpton is known for his role in the infamous Tawana Brawley case involving an African-American teenager girl who claims to have been raped by a group of white men and left with racial epithets scrawled on her body, in the same way that Smollett claims to have been jumped and had bleach thrown at him. In that case, a grand jury found the story to be fabricated, though not before it launched the career of Sharpton who now serves as an MSNBC host.

Americans may have forgotten that another current-day MSNBC TV host, Joy Reid, came under fire just last year for what appears to be a hoax of her own.

In 2018, Mediaite exposed Reid for previously posting homophobic comments on her blog. Mediaite reported that Reid’s blog included “defending homophobia, gay jokes, and the outright mocking of gay people and homosexuality” in addition to a reference about cringing “at the sight of two men kissing.”

Reid initially denied that she had posted the remarks on her blog, instead spinning a tale that she had been a victim of hack. However, a fly in the ointment appeared when The Daily Beast suspended her newer writings while an investigative reporter looked into the matter, and then the Federal Bureau of Investigations got involved.

According to USA Today, Reid’s attorney John H. Reichman said in a statement to media outlets that the FBI was looking into “potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts, belonging to Joy-Ann Reid.”

Reid allowed the charade to go on a bit longer, until according to Deadline Reid finally “came clean,” apologized for the homophobic remarks and admitted there was indeed no evidence of a hack. Without the pressure of an FBI criminal investigation, it is safe to suggest that Reid would have never capitulated.

Another liberal African American, Sen. Cory Booker — now a presidential candidate for 2020 — has found himself backpedaling from his own tall tale.

While serving as the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Booker began to tell stories about a tough-talking street bully named “T-Bone” — “a drug pusher who the mayor has said threatened his life at one turn and sobbed on his shoulder the next.”

The only problem? It appears that “T-Bone” was Booker’s imaginary friend.

According to National Review, a fellow city council member and longtime ally of Booker’s since 1998 shared with the Newark Star Ledger that “T-Bone” is “a figment of (Booker’s) imagination, even though Booker has talked about him in highly emotional terms and in great detail.”

Booker’s mentor and friend shared that Booker confided in him during a “tough conversation” in 2008 that T-Bone was not one individual, but instead a “composite” of people he had met in Newark.

Like the stories by Sharpton, Reid and Smollett, Booker’s tale began to unravel.

However, it wasn’t until he was on the campaign trail for U.S. Senate that reporters really began to press Booker for details of this mysterious figure. When pressed, Booker spoke of out of both sides of his mouth telling Esquire magazine in 2008 that T-Bone is “1,000 percent real” yet also an “archetype.” He also tap-danced around the question in an interview with The Washington Post.

To this day, Booker has never quite answered the question, although he has noticeably dropped the “T-Bone” stories from his campaign stump speeches.

One can’t help but compare these tales to current-day news about Smollett.

As if to put a cherry on top, Smollett’s brother and sister posted a Malcolm X quote on Instagram in defense of their brother: “This is the media, an irresponsible media. It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.” It seems a highly ironic statement now.

In a plot twist that might have surprised even the media-savvy Malcolm X, Sharpton, Reid, Booker and perhaps now Smollett belong to a unique club of liberal public figures who have gotten away with faking their way to the top.

Mr. Smollett had received an immediate outpouring of public support. Many cited his account as an example of another in a rising tide of hate crimes, which the F.B.I. reported last fall had increased for the third straight year.

But the change in thinking by investigators as the case progressed began to unleash criticism against the news media and politicians who many critics said were too quick to embrace a sketchy account in their drive to tarnish the president. It became a nightly topic on Fox News for Tucker Carlson, who called it a case of identity politics run amok. “Identity politics is a scam,” he said, “and it is not so different from the one that Jussie Smollett just pulled.”

Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review, said on Wednesday: “I think that the initial reaction suggested that there is a lot of credulity, especially among liberals who were looking at a story that seemed to confirm their impressions about Trump supporters.”

Mr. Smollett has continued to vehemently insist the incident occurred just as he reported it.

His lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement that said: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

From the start, investigators had difficulty corroborating Mr. Smollett’s story, even with about a dozen detectives assigned to the case."

Chicago police have named Smollett a suspect in a criminal investigation and say they have evidence that the 36-year-old actor filed a false police report over an alleged racist and homophobic assault on himself.

Police Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Wednesday that Smollett “is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

The grand jury will decide if Smollett will be indicted on the charges. He could face one to three years in prison if convicted, according to Variety.

Smollett had reported that he was attacked outside of his Chicago apartment in the early morning of Jan. 29.

According to officials, the openly gay 36-year-old actor and LGBTQ activist said attackers first yelled racial and homophobic slurs before they beat him and poured an unknown chemical substance over him. They also reportedly yelled “This is MAGA country,” and one wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck.

Last week, police picked up brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo at O’Hare Airport and questioned them about the alleged assault. A raid of the men’s residences produced five bottles of bleach, a red hat, two laptops and other items. It had been determined that the substance poured on Smollett was bleach.

Family members of the brothers said they left for their native Nigeria on the day of the alleged attack. Police kept tabs on their whereabouts and were waiting for them when they returned to Chicago.

Police said the two men are the same ones captured on a surveillance video screen grab on the night of the alleged attack. Local Chicago media have reported that the brothers told police that Smollett paid them to stage the attack, according to Variety.

Ola Osundairo had appeared as an extra on “Empire.” It has also been reported that Smollett followed the brothers on Instagram, and Smollett’s lawyers have acknowledged that one of the brothers is Smollett’s personal trainer.

Police are attempting to interview Smollett again, according to Variety.

Don’t let the facts get in the way of a good narrative.

For a time, that’s what happened in the case of Jussie Smollett, a gay, black actor who stars in the show “Empire,” who claimed he was the victim of a vicious and brutal hate crime in Chicago. On Wednesday, Smollett was charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct, according to Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest. pic.twitter.com/LvBSYE2kVj — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 21, 2019

The case received national attention, in part due to Smollett’s celebrity and his immediate openness to the media, and in part because of how media and pundits latched on to the story.

The underlying narrative was that, because of President Donald Trump, violent hate crimes against minorities are rising. Smollett’s story—that he was beaten by two men who poured bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck, and yelled, “This is MAGA country”—fit the narrative just too perfectly, which is why more reservations from the get-go would have served everyone well.

But that skepticism was notably absent. Celebrities and politicians couldn’t help themselves from jumping in to condemn not just the crime itself, but a large section of the American population.



While you won’t hear this from mainstream media, much of the talk about hate crimes lacks crucial context.



For instance, a report released Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left organization, claims that there is an all-time high number of hate groups since it began tracking in the 1980s.



Media out outlets ran headlines like “Trump ‘Fear-Mongering’ Fuels Rise of U.S. Hate Groups to Record: Watchdog,” and “President Trump Blamed for Rise in Hate Groups to Record High in New Report.”



Of course, it makes sense that there would be more hate groups on SPLC’s list given that its definition of what constitutes a hate group continues to expand, extending to mainstream social conservative organizations like the Family Research Council and Alliance Defending Freedom.



Furthermore, we have seen numerous hoaxes in recent years—in some cases, misreported incidents that turned out to be different from initial reports. Many of these were compiled on Twitter by Quillette’s Andy Ngo.



Peter Hasson at The Daily Caller News Foundation also catalogued 19 “hate crimes” in the Trump era that turned out much different than the media initially reported. This list included a woman who said a man threatened to light her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab, which turned out to be untrue, and a Texas waitress who faked a racist note about Hispanics she said she received on a receipt.

It also bears noting that the data on “rising” hate crimes is deeply unclear, as Reason’s Robby Soave has documented.

“While it’s true that the FBI’s count of hate crimes rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, it’s important to note that 1,000 additional agencies reported information to the FBI in the latter year,” Soave wrote. “It should go without saying, but as the number of agencies participating in the FBI’s count of hate crimes grows more numerous, the total number of hate crimes will undoubtedly rise. This does not necessarily mean that hate crimes are surging—just that the authorities undercounted them previously.”

Soave then explained how one statistic about rising anti-Semitism, which the Anti-Defamation League said had risen 57 percent under Trump, “reflected an increase in bomb threats against U.S.-based Jewish institutions perpetrated by just one person: a deranged Israeli teenager. Anti-Semitic violence, according to the [Anti-Defamation League’s] count, actually decreased 47 percent.”

This is not to say that these sorts of crimes aren’t happening, or that they aren’t actually on the rise. It is just misleading to make such a claim based on the available data.



Unfortunately, too many are willing to make snap judgments, despite the examples of hate crime hoaxes.



Just consider the reaction to Smollett, who has gone from victim to suspect over the course of a month.



Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the Smollett incident “a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”

The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence. https://t.co/2accVEJrCG — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 29, 2019

Among the worst takes were from Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who both equated the incident to an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

But then, the story began to unravel. A credible source revealed that Smollett allegedly paid two men to carry out the assault. Both Booker and Harris then pivoted and said we should wait for the facts to come out before rushing to judgment.



Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) on her tweet saying the Jussie Smollett case was an “attempted modern-day lynching”:

He called the attack a ""modern day lynching"" when the news broke. pic.twitter.com/8Zf8y7vhrv — Megan Pratz (@meganpratz) February 17, 2019

Right, OK.

But there’s even more reason to doubt Smollett. Back in January, he claimed to have received a racist, threatening letter containing a white substance. The Chicago Police Department has now cast doubt on the authenticity of the letter, which contained crushed Tylenol.

“The two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett attack told police that Smollett was behind creating a racist letter that was sent to the actor on the set of his show, ‘Empire,’ according to two sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation,” CBS Chicago reported.

Those two brothers said Smollett orchestrated the fake attack on himself after the letter failed to get a “bigger reaction.”



So, as of this moment, the evidence doesn’t fit the initial story at all.

Sanders, Booker, and Harris were just a few of the countless people who spewed hot takes on the matter and turned out to be egregiously wrong.

It should come as a word of caution to those who were quick to embrace a narrative that implicated large swaths of Americans. If further reports confirm that this was a hoax, it will just be one in a long string that have recently received widespread attention and turned out very differently from how they were initially reported.

If the allegations against Smollett are true, then he has indeed committed a very serious crime. Maybe he is just a disturbed man crying out for help, but his actions have wasted valuable police and FBI resources—not to mention the potential harm that could have been done had the police wrongly arrested someone for carrying out the “attack.”

Perhaps the greatest damage of all has been done to the real victims of such crimes. Whenever a hoax takes place, it becomes that much more difficult for them to be heard and believed.

While Smollett’s motives aren’t completely known, one thing can be said: It’s quite sick that he would rather be embraced as the victim of a hate crime than celebrated for his success as an actor.



This whole episode seems to be an extension of the identity politics culture we’ve seen on college campuses, which promotes victimhood as the main social currency over things like achievement and merit. Being a victim is more valuable than money or accomplishments, which Smollett seems to already have in spades.

John McWhorter, writing in The Atlantic, aptly called this trend “victimhood chic.”

“Future historians and anthropologists will find this aspect of early-21st-century America peculiar, intriguing, and sad,” McWhorter wrote.

One would hope so. Yet this assumes that victimhood chic will eventually die.



Given the growing power of leftist identity politics, it seems natural that incidents like this would, for the time being, become more common, not less.



And this is why it’s highly problematic when we look at stats like rising hate crime and hate groups and have reason to be suspicious when its proponents, so committed to the idea that history bends toward justice, try to convince us that mass violence and fascism are right around the corner.

""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.

Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department on Jan. 29 claiming that he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs. The ""Empire"" actor, who is black and gay, also said his attackers poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck.

Police investigated the reported attack as a ""possible hate crime,"" and some celebrities, including ""Empire"" cast members, and gay-rights advocates flocked to social media to express their support for Smollett.

But some other social media users began to question Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find video of the incident after going through a plethora of footage from many surveillance cameras in the affluent Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago where the attack allegedly occurred.

On Jan. 30, police released pictures from a surveillance camera located near where Smollett said he was attacked that showed two men who police said were ""potential persons of interest.""

The two men were taken into custody on Feb. 13 and questioned. They were released two days later, on Friday, without charges. Police said the two, who are brothers, are no longer suspects in the case and are cooperating in the probe.

On Saturday, a police source said the probe had shifted into whether the actor had paid the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, to stage an assault. Investigators had discovered that the brothers had purchased the rope used in the alleged attack.

Guglielmi said investigators wanted to have another interview with Smollett.

Smollett didn't talk to police on Monday or Tuesday. However, Ola and Abel Osundairo met with police and prosecutors at a criminal court building on Tuesday, according to police spokesman Tom Ahern.

That same afternoon, police investigated and then discounted a tip they received that Smollett was seen with the Osundairo brothers on the night of the attack.

Guglielmi told NBC News on Wednesday that the investigation into the alleged attack has demanded ""considerable"" resources. He said, at one point, the department had 12 detectives scouring for surveillance videos.

Smollet has told police he was on the phone with his manager during the alleged attack, and the manager said he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country."" The actor refused to hand over his cellphone to police, but later gave investigators a PDF file containing a limited list of his calls.

On Wednesday, Fox refuted a TMZ story claiming Smollett's scenes on the show were ""getting slashed"" from nine to four.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement.

In his first interview about the incident last week, the actor told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was angry about the alleged attack and that people were doubting him.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" Smollett said."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about being attacked on the street, according to Chicago police.

In a tweet early Thursday, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that Smollett ""is under arrest and in custody of detectives."" The actor and musician now faces felony criminal charges from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, which has accused him of ""Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.""

In a statement released Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson vowed to ""mount an aggressive defense.""

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Pugh and Henderson said.

The news of Smollett's arrest marks the latest development in a story of controversy and confusion since that began late last month.

Initially, Chicago police revealed that the actor, who is black and gay and portrays a gay character on Empire, had reported suffering a vicious assault while walking downtown in the early morning hours. According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

The assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a ""possible hate crime,"" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.

The unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.

Early in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as ""potential suspects"" — only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, ""new evidence"" that arose during their interrogations ""had shifted"" the investigation.

And they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.

All the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack — rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having ""no evidence"" — the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.

""At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

Smollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.

According to the FBI's ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,"" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.

In 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.

Local Chicago media reported the brothers told detectives that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

Smollett is also scheduled to work Thursday on the Chicago set of Empire. According to a production source, as of Wednesday night there were no plans to change the show’s shooting schedule.

Fox had previously stood by Smollett, issuing two statements of support over the course of the investigation.

Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class Four felony that carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years.

He had earlier declined to confirm reports subpoenas had been issued for the 36-year-old Smollett’s phone and bank records.

Police will now seek to arrest the actor.

Attorneys for Smollett, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said they would mount an “aggressive defence” of their client, but didn’t reveal his whereabouts.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement.

Police couldn’t find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects, and who were released Friday.

The charges against Smollett were filed after the two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

CBS 2 in Chicago obtained surveillance footage of the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, buying clothing that Smollett said they wore in the attack.

Two men who appear to be the Osundairos are seen with several items, including a red hat, black ski mask and gloves, on the counter for purchase.

Police said one of the men had appeared on Empire, and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video.

Smollett, who is black and came out as gay in 2015, made a tearful post-attack appearance on TV and said he’d been “forever changed” by the alleged assault.

1 Prison date postponed: A judge has agreed to postpone the start of ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s prison sentence by two months to May 6. New York Judge William Pauley approved the delay Wednesday after Cohen’s lawyers said he needed more time to recover from shoulder surgery and prepare for Congressional testimony. The House Oversight and Reform committee said Wednesday night that Cohen would testify publicly on Feb. 27. Cohen is scheduled to speak to the House Intelligence committee behind closed doors on Feb. 28.

2 “Green Book” travel: The Oscar-nominated interracial road trip movie “Green Book” has spurred interest in the guidebook that helped black travelers navigate segregated America. Travelers can find copies of “The Negro Motorist Green Book” online and can develop their own tours of sites that once provided refuge to African Americans during the Jim Crow era. To be sure, some of the sites mentioned in the Green Book no longer exist like the A.G. Gaston Motel in Birmingham, Ala., where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his aides stayed.

3 Witness killed: Florida authorities have found the body of a 14-year-old boy who disappeared in 2017 days after he witnessed a man’s slaying. Sarasota police said the body of Jabez Spann was found in a rural area in neighboring Manatee County. The body was identified by dental records. No cause of death was announced, but the case is being investigated as a homicide. Spann disappeared on Sept. 4, 2017, about a week after police say he witnessed the slaying of 31-year-old Travis Combs.

4 Colorado murder: After months of mostly silence from authorities investigating the disappearance of a Colorado mother on Thanksgiving Day, grim details about her suspected demise emerged this week, including accusations that the woman’s fiance beat her to death with a baseball bat while their baby was in the next room. Testimony from investigators at a court hearing Tuesday also revealed that Patrick Frazee had repeatedly asked an Idaho woman with whom he was having an affair to kill Kelsey Berreth, the mother of Frazee’s 1-year-old daughter. When she refused, he did it himself, authorities said. Berreth, a 29-year-old flight instructor, was last seen on Nov. 22 near her home in a mountain town near Colorado Springs, south of Denver.

5 Body awards: A Wisconsin school district official says its high school will no longer hand out cheerleading awards that are based on a girl’s physical attributes, including largest breasts or buttocks. The American Civil Liberties Union says an annual banquet has been held at Tremper High School in the Kenosha Unified School District that recognizes the most improved or hardest working cheerleaders. But the ACLU says special gag awards are also given based on certain physical attributes. District spokeswoman Tanya Ruder says these awards won’t be made at future banquets.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

‘I’m kind of stuck’: Class of 2020 struggling to find jobs amid coronavirus pandemic Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interviewwith Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Can’t say I blame him.

Because the story isn’t about Covington, but those who covered it – not to mention all the money they made off that smear.

COVINGTON HIGH STUDENT'S LEGAL TEAM SUES WASHINGTON POST

This case – along with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, actor Jussie Smollett and a hundred others – need to be a journalism course. One that reveals how echo-chamber media gins up outrage, protects narratives and steers social media into a frenzy.

We blame Twitter – but Twitter’s just the wall the media throws stuff at to see what sticks. If it sticks, you make a lot of money or use it to build the reputations of some left-wing hacks.

Nick's lawsuit means that in the future, some dope can’t brag to the Pulitzer committee that he broke the Covington story!

Remember the Supreme Court Senate confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, and how that turned many liberals, like Andrew Breitbart, into fire-breathing conservatives? Sometimes a show trial reveals more than you think.

Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., traded her reputation for a shot at Kavanaugh.

Since 2016, those epiphany moments like Covington have piled up. In mere months we've seen three major media fails.

There are others. But there's only one persistent culprit at the crime scene: the mainstream media.

Journalists who are writing for other journalists, hoping to get a better job, a book deal, a prize, a minute on TV.

And the motivating factor behind the machine: conflict.

Conflict leads to eyeballs, which leads to clicks, which leads to money.

The Chicago Police Department has officially named Empire actor Jussie Smollett “as a suspect in a criminal investigation” in the city “for filing a false police report.”

Smollett said two white men attacked him in January. The men poured bleach on him, placed a noose around his neck, and screamed, “This is MAGA country!”

His story unraveled every day since then. Sources poured out information to local media that investigators believed Smollett paid brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to attack him.

CBS Chicago obtained video of the brothers purchasing the items used in the alleged attack.

More from CBS Chicago:

The Osundairos were arrested last week, but later released without charges. Sources have said the two brothers told police they helped stage the attack with Smollett. They said they were paid $3,500 to pour a chemical on the actor, and place a rope around his neck, while yelling racist and homophobic slurs. The two brothers told police Smollett also was behind creating a racist letter sent to the show, according to two sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. When that letter did not get a “bigger reaction,” Smollett orchestrated the attack a week later with the two men, sources said.

The Chicago Tribune has more on that letter:

A week before he says he was attacked by two men yelling slurs, “Empire” star Jussie Smollett reported receiving a small white envelope addressed to him in a thick red scrawl at the Fox production studios on the West Side. Smollett told police he and the show’s executive producer used gloves to open the envelope. Inside was a sheet of white paper with a threat in cut-out letters: “You will die black fag.” There was white powder in the envelope, but it was later determined to be crushed acetaminophen, a pain reliever found in Tylenol, police said. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter. It was postmarked in southwest suburban Bedford Park on Jan. 18, four days earlier, and bore two American flag stamps. The letters MAGA were written, also in red ink, in the upper-left corner of the envelope.

The FBI crime lab has possession of the letter for analysis.

Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi released the news early Thursday morning.

Supt. Eddie Johnson plans to hold a morning news conference and Smollett is expected to appear in court later in the day.

Smollett, 36, was charged Wednesday with disorderly conduct — a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years upon conviction, but could also be punishable by probation.

On Wednesday, authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett's lawyers to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender,"" Guglielmi said.

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. local time on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop downtown.

The actor said the men beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

In a statement, lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement Wednesday saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and his character isn't being written off the show. The statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Brothers 'manned up,' attorney says

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn't find footage of the alleged beating.

They found and released images of two people they wanted to question. Last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men's apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their lawyer as Abimbola (Abel) and Olabinjo (Ola) Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesperson said the brothers appeared before the panel to ""lock in their testimony.""

A lawyer representing the brothers said her clients ""manned up"" and testified in front of a grand jury before prosecutors charged Smollett.

Without providing details, Gloria Schmidt told reporters the two men accepted money from Smollett and wanted to come clean. She said they weren't motivated by any promises from prosecutors.

""There was never a change of heart,"" Schmidt said. ""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said, `We're gonna correct this.' Plea deal, immunity, all of that — they don't' care about that.""

Probation, restitution most likely, ex-prosecutor says

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if there's no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record, which concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Risa Lanier, chief of the prosecution bureau for the Cook County State’s Attorney Office, outlined the state’s case against Smollett after the hearing.

Prosecutors have identified the two men as brothers Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. They say Smollett and Abel Osundairo were close friends who worked together on “Empire,” where Abel was a stand-in for a love interest of Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon. Prosecutors also say Abel had been ""a source of designer drugs” including molly, a form of MDMA, for Smollett since spring 2018. They say Smollett met Ola Osundairo, who appeared as an extra on “Empire,” “on several occasions through Abel.”

AD

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, 36, was the guiding force behind the staged attack — right down to the intersection where it took place. They say Smollett told the Osundairo brothers, who are of Nigerian descent, to call his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and say, “This is MAGA country.” They also say Smollett provided a $100 bill for supplies including rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball hats resembling the “Make America Great Again” hats associated with President Trump’s campaign. According to prosecutors, Smollett coordinated the plan around a trip the brothers had planned to Nigeria.

During the hearing, which drew a large crowd of reporters, Smollett took deep breaths, shook his head and kept his eyes closed. Lyke called the charges, if true, “despicable."" Four members of Smollett’s family, including his three brothers, were in the packed courtroom.

AD

AD

The next court hearing is March 14.

At a media briefing Thursday morning, Chicago police said Smollett concocted the story of a brutal hate crime because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on the Fox drama. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department has a $3,500 check Smollett paid the men to help him stage the fake attack after a crude, threatening letter he sent to the “Empire” set in Chicago failed to get attention.

Johnson was remarkably forceful in his remarks about the case, which has gained widespread media attention since Smollett told police he was attacked in the city last month. Johnson, a black Chicago native, said the actor “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

AD

Johnson lamented the many resources Chicago police used on an investigation that lasted weeks. Detective Commander Edward Wodnicki said detectives interviewed more than 100 individuals and used both police cameras and private-sector cameras to plot a timeline of the alleged assault.

AD

Wodnicki said surveillance footage, along with taxi and ride-hailing service records, helped police track down Abel and Ola Osundairo. The brothers, who were taken into custody Feb. 13, upon returning from Nigeria to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, gave police information implicating Smollett and were released last Friday without being charged. Wodnicki said they appeared as witnesses before a grand jury Wednesday, just hours before police announced that Smollett was a suspect in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys have maintained he did not play a role in his attack.

In a matter of weeks, Smollett traveled an arc from a black and openly gay hate crime victim to a potential criminal himself. The vivid details of his alleged Jan. 29 attack — including a rope put around his neck — captured the attention of Democratic presidential hopefuls and celebrities as a tangible result of social decay and toxic political discourse.

AD

AD

As Smollett’s claims unraveled among inconsistencies and police gathered new evidence, conservatives criticized the incident as an example of a credulous media extending a narrative that Trump supporters have escalated his divisive rhetoric with acts of violence.

President Trump reacted to news of Smollett’s arrest on Twitter Thursday. “@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,” Trump wrote.

On Wednesday, Chicago-based attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, who are representing Smollett, wrote in a statement: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

AD

AD

The news of the felony charge, announced by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, came just hours after the city’s police department said the “Empire” actor was being treated as a suspect in the criminal investigation. Police said days ago that they wanted to speak with Smollett again after new evidence “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Police first investigated the incident as a possible hate crime.

There have been heightened doubts about Smollett’s allegations amid news reports, which cited unnamed police sources, he may have staged the attack. In a statement late Saturday, attorneys Pugh and Henderson said Smollett had “been further victimized by claims” that he “played a role in his own attack.”

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” they wrote in the statement.

AD

AD

Smollett has aligned himself in the past with organizations dedicated to HIV/AIDS awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy. He invoked this while discussing the skepticism surrounding his claims during an interview that aired last week on “Good Morning America.”

“I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

When details of Smollett’s alleged assault were released by police last month, celebrities and other high-profile figures rallied around him — some seizing on the apparently racist and homophobic nature of the alleged attack or the reported invocation of Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign slogan. But growing questions surrounding the case caused unease.

“Why would he make it harder for people who actually suffer from hate crimes? It makes no sense. The lie is so damaging,” writer Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday. She previously wrote that she hoped Smollett “knows how many people are thinking of him and committed to holding this administration and its ilk accountable for this hothouse of hate being fostered.”

As the case was increasingly scrutinized, some questioned whether Smollett staged the attack to prevent being written out of “Empire,” a theory that Fox denied even as questions swirled around Smollett’s allegations. On Thursday, Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment said in a statement: “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.” They did not respond to a request for comment about the actor’s salary, which has not been made public.

Several politicians initially spoke out in support of Smollett but have since adjusted their stances, including Democratic Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who called for judgment to be withheld until the investigation has been completed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) deleted a tweet that referred to the alleged attack as “an affront to our humanity.”

Others, such as filmmaker Ava Duvernay, expressed caution over putting faith in the police department. “Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times?” she tweeted. “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

The widespread media and celebrity attention was something Johnson repeatedly brought up at Thursday’s briefing. He grimly noted that he wished “the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention.”

Johnson also expressed concern that Smollett’s alleged hoax would lead hate crimes to be met in the future “with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.” He said Smollett had been treated like a victim until “we received evidence that led detectives in another direction.”

“We gave him the benefit of the doubt,” Johnson said later while responding to questions from reporters. “But when we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off.”"

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about being attacked on the street, according to Chicago police.

In a tweet early Thursday, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that Smollett ""is under arrest and in custody of detectives."" The actor and musician now faces felony criminal charges from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, which has accused him of ""Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.""

In a statement released Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson vowed to ""mount an aggressive defense.""

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Pugh and Henderson said.

The news of Smollett's arrest marks the latest development in a story of controversy and confusion since that began late last month.

Initially, Chicago police revealed that the actor, who is black and gay and portrays a gay character on Empire, had reported suffering a vicious assault while walking downtown in the early morning hours. According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

The assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a ""possible hate crime,"" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.

The unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.

Early in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as ""potential suspects"" — only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, ""new evidence"" that arose during their interrogations ""had shifted"" the investigation.

And they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.

All the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack — rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having ""no evidence"" — the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.

""At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

Smollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.

According to the FBI's ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,"" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.

In 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.

The US star, 36, alleged he was the victim of a racially motivated and homophobic attack, in which he was beaten and had a noose looped around his neck.

However, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department has now confirmed the star is being treated as a suspect in the case and officers will present evidence to a grand jury.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men when returning home from a Subway at 2am on January 29, was forced to flee and taken to hospital. He claimed racist and homophobic insults were hurled at him.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted an update on the progress of the investigation, writing: “Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony).

“Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

It had been previously said that information on the case had “shifted”, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, who like his character Jamal Lyon is black and gay, said he was attacked by two masked men who yelled “this is MAGA country” during their alleged assault.

Legal representatives of Smollett responded to prior claims that the attack may have been orchestrated.

They said in a statement: “Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”"

Cory Booker (NJ) and Kamala Harris (CA) – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) is the one who I have most wanted to see provide an updated response.

As a refresher, here’s what she tweeted on Jan. 30, the day after the allegations were first reported:

There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes. https://t.co/QAi0IYtSeR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 30, 2019

In spite of all the new information that has come out about this case, namely that it was all an elaborate hoax, the typically boisterous Congresswoman has gone curiously silent on the issue.

Here are five possible reasons why:

1. She’s busy figuring out new ways to torch our Constitution.

Oh, it’s true. It’s d*mn true.

A blatant undermining of our First Amendment and the free speech institutions which safeguard our free republic and rights. Democracy died a little today…. https://t.co/Wvv1YEn0L3 — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 20, 2019

(RELATED!)

2. She and her squad may be tracking down the 23 co-workers who won the New York state lottery to make sure they, you know, pay their “fair share.”

CBS News reports:

The eighth-largest Mega Millions jackpot in history now belongs to a group of 23 co-workers who came forward anonymously in January to form an LLC named, appropriately, “New Life 2019.” Lottery officials say the group chose a single lump-sum payment which, after taxes, comes to a whopping $176 million. Each winner will take home nearly $7.7 million.

3. She’s still trying to convince doubters she really is a selfless woman and defender of those who have been “left behind.”

Come for me all you want, but my job is to make sure that people are protected in society. Someone’s got to look out for the people our system is leaving behind – esp now, when most of the wealth created is going to fewer people, those left behind are the majority of Americans. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 15, 2019

This is, of course, when she’s not actively lobbying against them being able to find a $15/hour job with Amazon in her state, anyway.

4. Perhaps she’s out scouring the streets of New York City looking for that non-existent $3 billion Amazon tax break money.

This is hysterical. Seriously. Hysterical. She thinks that money is there. 😁 https://t.co/xfPRUgXrSe — Sister Toldjah 🤔 (@sistertoldjah) February 20, 2019

Transcript:

“If we were willing to give away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest those $3 billion in our district ourselves, if we wanted to. We could hire out more teachers. We can fix our subways. We can put a lot of people to work for that money, if we wanted to,” Ocasio-Cortez said last week…

5. She’s too busy being all defensive about her boyfriend’s official government email address.

Actually this cal designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Cal. Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time. Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 15, 2019

As Red State‘s Jennifer Van Laar pointed out earlier, though, the freshman rep’s excuses don’t hold water. Ms. Woman of the People has gone all swampy in her short amount of time in DC.

Now that Smollett is considered a suspect for filing a false police report, will Ocasio-Cortez finally take the time to weigh in on the case?

Don’t hold your breath. Because she stays in non-stop virtue signalling mode, and having to say “I’m sorry” for rushing to judgment is not something people who are so wrapped up in believing their own fawning press are willing to do.

Police were trying to get in touch with Smollett's attorneys to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender"" Guglielmi said. That could involve Smollett turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Richard Shotwell/AP Jussie Smollett could face up to three years in prison after saying he was attacked by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him.

He said he did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account - something police signalled Friday (local time) when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" - before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday (local time), Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released.

The next day, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on Empire, and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, Sum of My Music, last year.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Senator Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport. For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of US$8400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Also Wednesday (local time), Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about being attacked on the street, according to Chicago police.

In a tweet early Thursday, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that Smollett ""is under arrest and in custody of detectives."" The actor and musician now faces felony criminal charges from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, which has accused him of ""Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.""

In a statement released Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson vowed to ""mount an aggressive defense.""

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Pugh and Henderson said.

The news of Smollett's arrest marks the latest development in a story of controversy and confusion since that began late last month.

Initially, Chicago police revealed that the actor, who is black and gay and portrays a gay character on Empire, had reported suffering a vicious assault while walking downtown in the early morning hours. According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

The assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a ""possible hate crime,"" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.

The unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.

Early in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as ""potential suspects"" — only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, ""new evidence"" that arose during their interrogations ""had shifted"" the investigation.

And they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.

All the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack — rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having ""no evidence"" — the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.

""At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

Smollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.

According to the FBI's ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,"" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.

In 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.

Chicago police announced about 5:30 a.m. that Smollett was taken into custody for the felony charge of disorderly conduct in falsifying a police report. The class 4 felony is punishable by up to three years in prison. A bond hearing is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.

Smollett’s lawyers said that the actor plans to mount “an aggressive defense” against the charge. Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” the statement said, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, who is black, openly gay and is known for a portraying a character who is also gay, allegedly told police that he was assaulted by two men in the early hours of Jan. 29. Smollett said that the attackers beat him, used racist and homophobic slurs, splattered him with chemicals, draped a rope around his neck and shouted, “this is MAGA country.”

On Wednesday, Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said detectives presented evidence to a grand jury that Smollett falsified his story to police.

After Smollett’s story first became public, he received an outpouring of public support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Donald Trump and Sen. Kamala Harris were among those who spoke out to condemn the attack.

In recent days, however, Smollett’s account has been met with increasing public skepticism. Last week, a pair of Nigerian brothers were apprehended, questioned and then released without charges. Police also said that the phone records Smollett had submitted to them were insufficient to help with the investigation.

Last Thursday, Smollett gave an interview to ABC’s Good Morning America to speak about the alleged attack. He said that he had been “forever changed” by the incident, and spoke out against people who said his claims were a hoax.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth,” Smollett said.

On Sunday, Guglielmi announced that there had been new “developments” in the case, and that they intended to interview the “individual who reported the incident.”

A representative for Smollett did not immediately return a request for comment.

FOX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CHICAGO, Feb 21 — Actor Jussie Smollett was charged yesterday with filing a false police report when he said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs, Chicago police said yesterday, with the actor now facing arrest.

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama Empire, ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan 29 that two apparent supporters of US President Donald Trump beat him up on the streets of Chicago, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

Lawyers for Smollett, who has stuck by his story for three weeks as police failed to find surveillance video of an assault and suspicions of a hoax grew on social media, have not responded to requests for comment yesterday.

Smollett’s agent and public relations managers also did not return calls from Reuters.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, declined comment when told earlier yesterday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

Two Nigerian brothers

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognised from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

Local TV station CBS Chicago yesterday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

Smollett told police his assailants were white, that one wore a red hat, and that they shouted: “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” - as they struck him, the New York Times has reported.

Chicago police say the charge of filing a false police report carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.

According to a tweet from Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, this is a Class 4 felony and detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County grand jury.

If the 36-year-old “Empire” actor is charged, he could face one to three years in prison.

Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department on Jan. 29 claiming that he was assaulted by two masked men. They hurled racist and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and put a noose around his neck.

Two brothers, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were questioned by police, claiming Smollett staged the “attack” and paid them $3,500. The men are cooperating with law enforcement and records show they purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett’s attorneys met with Cook County prosecutors on Wednesday, according to Chicago Police spokesman Tom Ahern.

The actor, who plays Jamal Lyon on “Empire,” has denied allegations that he orchestrated the attack. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement.

20th Century Fox Television, which produces “Empire,” has also denied reports that he is being written off the series. “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” said Fox in a statement.

UPDATE: Jussie Smollett has officially been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He faces up to three years in prison.

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report,” tweeted Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. “Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

A Cook County Grand Jury indicted the “Empire” star late Wednesday after grand jurors heard testimonies and evaluated evidence. The two brothers told jurors they staged the “attack” and were paid for it.

UPDATE 2: Smollett was arrested by Chicago police on Thursday morning on suspicion of filing a false report. He reportedly paid two men $3,500 to help him stage the hate crime hoax after a threatening letter he sent to the “Empire” set failed to get attention.

Investigators believe Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on the Fox series.

Smollett, who faces as many as three years in prison, is said to have orchestrated the Jan. 29 assault during which the men yelled racist and homophobic slurs and put a noose around his neck. “This is MAGA country,” the attackers were reported to have said.

“Why would anyone — especially an African-American man — use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” asked Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson during a news conference. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

President Trump reacted to Smollett’s arrest, tweeting, “@JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA.”

A judge has set a $100,000 bond for Smollett and he must surrender his passport."

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn’t find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had “shifted” the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

In addition to potentially facing real jail time, Smollett could also find his acting career in jeopardy.

Variety spoke with Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations, who shared his insight on the situation.

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” Torossian said. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

In late January, Smollett claimed that he was assaulted by two white men who told him he was in ""MAGA country,"" and proceeded to beat him for being being black and gay. The assault was quickly suspected to be a hate crime, and investigated as such.

Police eventually tracked down two persons of interest in the situation and brought them in for questioning. The men turned out to be Abel and Ola Osundairo, who have reportedly told police that Smollett orchestrated the whole thing and paid them to help.

Regarding the heat that Smollett is now facing, a handful of legal experts have weighed in on what he's potentially facing.

“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said former federal prosecutor-turned-Chicago criminal defense attorney Phil Turner. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”

“It’s a very high-profile case,” former Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prosecutor Andrew Weisberg added. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Chicago defense attorney Steve Greenberg offered. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

Smollett has denied the accusations that created the assault as a hoax, saying through his attorney, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

At this time, it is unknown if the Chicago police department will file charges against Smollett. If the actor did indeed falsify a police report, the charge against him would be a Class 4 felony in the state of Illinois.

This particular charge carries a possible sentence of as little as one year or as many as three years behind bars. Additionally, Variety notes that ""Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation."""

This news comes just a day after Guglielmi released a statement Tuesday dismissing a tip that was received revealing that Smollett and the accomplices were in an elevator in the building on the same night of the attack since it did not support video evidence.

Since the incident, investigators have gone through hundreds of hours of surveillance video from where the entertainer said he was attack, but they have not found footage of him being assaulted.

Two men were identified as suspects, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo were questioned last week, and based on the information that was provided by them to Guglielmi, it has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

An increasing number of reports are leading to the belief that the alleged attack was a hoax, but Smollett’s lawyers said the actor is angry at those claims. He feels “victimized” by reports that he was involved in setting up in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys representing Smollett from Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, Anne Kavanagh said that the actor is “keeping an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

On Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, and Chicago’s top prosecutor recused herself from the investigation. This also comes as surveillance video of the two brothers has been made public by TMZ, showing the Osundario brothers purchasing ski masks, red hats and other items from a local store that were allegedly used in the staged attack."

Similarly, an unfolding police investigation into the alleged attack in the Windy City involving ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, 36, quickly suggested ""something is rotten in Chicago.""

Several factors did not add up. New evidence now explains why.

One point is clear: Following the Jan. 23 Covington Catholic High School boys incident – generating false accusations they confronted a Native American Indian who, in actuality, had confronted them – a valuable lesson remains unlearned. Liberals, eager to believe the worst, prove unwilling to let investigations run their course, instead quickly launching salacious claims against those they believe responsible: conservatives.

The background is this:

Smollett reported to police that at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, he was returning to his apartment – a Subway sandwich bag in one hand and holding his cellphone in the other – when two white men wearing ski masks attacked him. He claims they yelled, ""This is MAGA country"" and other racial and homophobic slurs, tossing a liquid substance on him, later determined to be bleach. Carrying a noose, they placed it around Smollett's neck. Fighting them off, he escaped.

Police, investigating it as a potential hate crime, reviewed all film footage available from cameras along Smollett's return route. The entire transit was covered except for a 60-second gap.

But several details, taken collectively, raised questions about the attack's authenticity.

Nearly zero degrees that morning, it was extremely cold – not conditions particularly inviting for racists to be out looking for victims. As a target of opportunity, heavily clothed and in the dark, Smollett seemed to be very quickly recognized by his attackers who then hurled homophobic slurs at him. When the attack occurred, Smollett was on the phone with his manager. Police asked to examine his phone; he refused. Why would he not willingly cooperate? Phone records were later provided with certain details redacted, Smollett claims, for personal reasons. Film footage did reveal two possible male subjects, later identified and located by police – not white as claimed but Nigerian brothers. Police interviewed and temporarily arrested them, obtaining a search warrant for their home. Bleach and some other items were seized for testing. Puzzling was that two black persons would assault Smollett, also black, using words suggesting they were President Donald Trump supporters – victimizing a black man for not being in the same MAGA camp. In an amazing coincidence, if not planned, at least one of the Nigerians was an extra from Smollett's television program. Film footage of the final leg of Smollett's trek that morning showed him entering his apartment lobby, cellphone and sandwich bag in hand, passing the night security person in the lobby, making no effort to immediately contact police. Smollett's rationale for not surrendering his phone – concern others might gain access to ""Empire"" cast phone numbers – plus the fact the Nigerians knew him, prompted police to look into two scenarios: The alleged attackers had specifically targeted Smollett – unlikely as they would not have known he would be out at 2 a.m.; or

It was a hoax, making full access to his phone important to determine if he was talking to his manager or coordinating with the attackers. Meanwhile, liberals, such as Rep. Mad Maxine Waters, D-Calif., immediately jumped on the issue. Supporting Smollett, Waters blamed Trump for the attack – ironic as Waters encouraged public confrontation of Trump officials, advising the ""resistance"" to take to the streets. Also unwilling to await investigative results was Democratic Sen. Cory Booker who described the attack as ""an attempted modern day lynching."" How could Smollett have identified ski-masked attackers as white? Oddly, despite the attack, Smollett still had his cellphone and Subway sandwich bag in hand. Having fought off attackers to escape, how did he manage to retain both?

If indeed a hoax, why? Speculation is Smollett believed he was being written out of ""Empire"" and possibly saw this incident as a way to generate sympathy to keep him on. Producers say not so, although it looks like now he will due to the hoax. More likely, Smollett's motivation was his intense hatred of Trump. In an interview, claiming his attackers were inspired by the president, Smollett glowed, similar to Senator Cory Booker did, in his own ""Spartacus"" moment, patting himself on the back for being, ""really, really hard against his administration. … I don't hold my tongue.""

The most recent evidence against the Nigerians is their purchase of rope for the noose at an Ace Hardware store. Confronted with this, they cooperated with police, who then understood Smollett's role.

The brothers say they were paid $3,500, which Smollett denies. While they told police the three even practiced the attack, none realized a sandwich would be their undoing.

Fair-minded police repeatedly rejected calling the incident a hoax, until the Nigerians finally confessed. Sadly, Smollett's hoax seems to be part of a growing trend portraying conservatives as intolerant and evil.

Chicago is well-known for having the highest murder rate of any city. As murder investigations piled up, police devoted much time to solving Smollett's case to prevent racial unrest. At a time race issues are fueling an angry public, it is despicable Smollett stoked that fire with false testimony. One black activist calls for Smollett's arrest as he could have triggered a race war, evidenced by some Smollett supporters' warning of a revenge revolution.

While his Twitter bioline claims, ""I am simply here to help save the world,"" Smollett may have just made it a more dangerous one. Reportedly, a grand jury will decide next week whether to bring criminal charges against him.

Additionally, the FBI is now investigating whether a threatening letter received by Smollett before the alleged attack was also the actor's doing.

If he lied, Smollett – and others facilitating the hoax – should all be prosecuted. He can somewhat redeem himself by acknowledging his involvement now so his die-hard supporters can let go. If he did not lie, he has a great marketing opportunity: Imagine Subway advertising that their sandwiches are so delicious, customers escaping assaults risk life and limb to retrieve them!

Such an ad will never air – nor will further evidence Smollett's attack was not pre-planned."

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., not only believed black and openly gay actor Jussie Smollett's tale of being attacked by two N-word-spouting homophobic Trump-supporters, she – and many other big-name Democrats – knew exactly whom to blame.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who became famous by falsely accusing an assistant district attorney of raping a black teenage girl, weighed in.

The president should have said, 'My brand shouldn't stand for that.'

We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts."" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in a tweet, called the alleged attack ""a modern day lynching.""

Isn't it good news that the story is alleged to be false? Isn't it good news that Trump-supporting goons are not patrolling the streets at night, armed with bleach and a noose, to find, attack, whitewash and lynch black and gay Trump-bashers? A PeopleTV host actually said she was ""hoping"" and ""praying"" that Smollett's story was true.

TRENDING: Same DA charging cop who shot Rayshard Brooks is under investigation himself

Why did so many uncritically buy Smollett's story? One reason is that an Axios poll last November found that 61 percent of Democrats believe Republicans are ""racist/ bigoted/sexist."" Thirty-one percent of Republicans feel that way about Democrats. And most Democrats and members of the media believe Trump is a racist. So why doubt such a juicy story that falsely advances two narratives? Trump is Exhibit A that racism remains a major problem in America. And if Trump is a ""racist,"" therefore so are his supporters.

But what does it say about America's alleged ""systemic,"" ""structural"" and ""institutional"" racism when, in 2019, the cupboard is so bare that ""racist attacks"" have to be manufactured? Last year, in a span of a few weeks, three black motorists claimed they were victims of racism by the white cops who pulled them over. One, a reverend, was the president of a local branch of the NAACP. He posted on social media a long, detailed description of the alleged interaction with the cop whom he claimed racially profiled him and made harassing comments. A black female motorist took to social media to say she had a ""traumatic experience"" in Virginia when she was pulled over for speeding and ""threatened"" by a ""white cop, who ""degraded"" her ""as an African-American."" And a viral post by a civil rights ""activist"" claimed a Texas trooper sexually assaulted another black woman following a traffic stop and then arrested her for DUI. But they were all unaware that they were being recorded. The tapes show all three were lying. The cops involved were courteous, polite and respectful. The black motorists lied about the white cops. But if not for the recordings, who knows what might have happened to the careers of the officers.

As to the belief that racism remains a serious problem in America, can we agree that nirvana is not an option? In a nation of 330 million people, bad actors abound. After all, one survey in 2017 found that 7 percent of adult Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows. That works out to over 17 million adults. And a 1997 Gallup poll found that 4 percent of Americans believed Elvis was still alive.

But today's definition of ""race relations"" pretty much comes down to this: how black people feel about white people and how white people feel about how black people feel about white people. Racism has so receded as an impediment to progress that new terms became necessary to describe offensive ""racist"" behavior, such as ""microaggressions."" This means whites are racist, even if they don't think they are, because of their ""white privilege."" If white people spent as much time thinking about how to oppress black people as black people think they do, white people wouldn't have enough time to oppress black people."

Chicago police say that US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report.

The Empire star had said he was subjected to a homophobic and racist physical attack by two men in January.

Doubt was later cast on his account after US media reported that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack.

Mr Smollett's lawyers said they would ""conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defence"".

On Wednesday a police spokesman said felony criminal charges had been approved against the actor.

Mr Smollett had been charged for ""disorderly conduct / filing a false police report"", the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a tweet.

""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

Lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, who are representing the actor, said in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

They had previously said that Mr Smollett had ""been further victimised by claims... that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth.""

Earlier on Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show the two brothers buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last week. They were later released and are said to be co-operating with the investigation.

One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire.

What did Smollett say happened?

The actor, who is gay, said he had gone out to buy food late at night when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him, punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck.

""This is Maga country,"" he says they told him, referring to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.

The actor said he had been ""forever changed"" by the incident.

The incident led to an outpouring of support for Smollett from stars including Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell."

Except it was the opposite of what they meant.

There was no ""modern-day lynching.""

There was no crazed, MAGA attack.

TRENDING: Same DA charging cop who shot Rayshard Brooks is under investigation himself

The vice president was not somehow complicit (as per Ellen Page).

This did not reveal the violent state of our nation.

Instead, the response to the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett revealed another dark side of America.

A dark side just as ugly and potentially even more dangerous.

This is America, 2019.

It is an America in which we rush to judgment before having the facts at hand. And it is an America in which we also function as judge and jury, taking the law into our own hands.

It is an America in which sound bites educate and in which edited video clips inform.

It is an America that could easily lead to a volatile mobocracy.

Do you think I'm exaggerating?

Do you think there would not be a violent attack on the home of an alleged racist homophobe, simply based on an allegation? Do you think there would not be a physical assault on the person himself? Do you think that if Jussie Smollett had identified an alleged attacker by name that his life would not be endangered?

""There he is! Get him!""

And get him they would – without facts, without verification, without justification.

It's bad enough that menacing protesters showed up at the home of Tucker Carlson.

It's bad enough that a disruptive little gang could drive Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife from a restaurant.

It's bad enough that the Covington Catholic School had to shut down temporarily because of threats. (And may I point out that all these acts of mobocracy have come from the left?)

But it's even worse when the media are complicit in fanning the flames.

It's even worse when reporters report irresponsibly, just because the story fits their narrative. (In Joy Behar's candid admission, it's ""because we're desperate to get rid Trump out."") Have they forgotten the word ""alleged""? (In this context, a New York Times op-ed by Noah Rothman is relevant, addressing, ""An object lesson in what happens when people in positions of political and cultural authority indulge their biases by suspending disbelief."")

And what happens when political leaders join in the frenzy, also suspending critical judgment because the report so perfectly supports their biases? What happens when they're joined by outspoken celebrities?

To say this would result in a highly toxic, genuinely dangerous situation would be an understatement.

As to the larger societal sickness that this latest episode has revealed, Andy Ngo had this to say over at National Review: ""Jussie Smollett's hoax is symptomatic of America's illness. Because of the mainstreaming of academia's victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable, or even kind. Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted, treated with child gloves, and believed unreservedly. Their 'lived experience' gives them infinite wisdom. Those who urge caution are treated as bigots.""

The reality is that we did almost have a modern-day lynching.

A lynching of all those who would dare wear a MAGA hat. A lynching of Trump supporters in general. A lynching of those who happen to be white or who do not celebrate homosexuality.

All of them (of us?) were now complicit in the alleged attack on a gay black man.

This is America, 2019 – and we're only in February.

May I suggest that all of us slow down and take a deep breath? That we make a personal determination to investigate and confirm before drawing a conclusion? (Ironically, Sen. Kamala Harris, one of the first political leaders to rush to judgment and refer to a ""modern-day lynching,"" now wants to wait for a full investigation of the alleged attack before commenting on its apparent mendacity. So, she was quick to believe its truthfulness but cautious to believe its falsehood.)

Can we make this unfortunate situation into a teachable moment for all of us, regardless of our political persuasions?

There are enough real issues of racism or hatred to focus on and address. We can agree on their wrongness and work together for a better country.

But our intellectually lazy and morally irresponsible rushes to judgment, coupled with the very real threat of mob violence, have moved us on to very dangerous ground.

Time to slow down and take stock. Or else."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has been arrested for allegedly filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate-crime attack in Chicago, a police spokesman said early Thursday.

Smollett was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct for the allegedly false report he made with Chicago police on Jan. 29, according to the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. In it he claimed he was assaulted by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs.

The actor, 36, who is black and gay, also said his attackers poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Smollett was in the custody of detectives, who had earlier contacted Smollett's legal team ""to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest."" He could face probation or up to three years in prison if convicted, a Cook County State’s Attorney office spokeswoman told NBC Chicago.

The actor is due in court for a bond hearing at 1:30 p.m. CT Thursday.

The announcement of charges on Wednesday night came after Smollett's attorneys talked with prosecutors in the morning, according to police.

In a statement released after Smollett was charged, his attorneys said he ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" the statement from attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Meanwhile, the top prosecutor in the Chicago area, Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx, has recused herself from the case.

The state's attorney stepped away from the matter because she had ""had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department,"" a spokesperson for the office said.

Foxx’s first assistant prosecutor, Joe Magats, will handle the case.

Police investigated the reported attack as a ""possible hate crime,"" and some celebrities, including ""Empire"" cast members, and gay-rights advocates flocked to social media to express their support for Smollett.

But some other social media users began to question his claims when police said they were not able to find video of the incident after going through a plethora of footage from many surveillance cameras in the affluent Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, where the attack allegedly occurred.

Guglielmi told NBC News that the investigation into the alleged attack has demanded ""considerable"" police resources. He said that at one point the department had 12 detectives scouring surveillance videos.

On Jan. 30, police released pictures from a surveillance camera located near where Smollett said he was attacked that showed two men who police said were ""potential persons of interest.""

The two men were taken into custody on Feb. 13 and questioned. They were released two days later, on Friday, without charges. Police said the two, who are brothers, were no longer suspects in the case and were cooperating in the probe.

On Saturday, a police source said the probe had shifted into whether the actor had paid the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, to stage an assault. Investigators had discovered that the brothers had purchased the rope used in the alleged attack.

Guglielmi said then that investigators wanted to have another interview with Smollett.

Smollett didn't talk to police on Monday or Tuesday. However, Ola and Abel Osundairo met with police and prosecutors at a criminal court building on Tuesday, according to police spokesman Tom Ahern.

The Osundairo brothers also met with prosecutors for about two and a half hours Wednesday, said their attorney Gloria Schmidt during a news conference.

She said that her clients were ""getting their story out there to the police"" so that investigators ""could do their work."" She added that investigators would spend hours with her clients in an effort to understand just 15 minutes of a timeline around the alleged assault.

Schmidt said the brothers don't expect to be charged in the case ""because they are not guilty of anything."" She also said they haven't negotiated a plea deal because ""you don't need immunity when you have the truth.""

Smollett has told police he was on the phone with his manager during the alleged attack, and the manager said he heard the attackers say, ""This is MAGA country."" The actor refused to hand over his cellphone to police, but later gave investigators a PDF file containing a limited list of his calls.

Police said the manager, Brandon Moore, is not a suspect but is rather a ""cooperating witness.""

Choreographer Frank Gatson, who made the 911 call about the alleged incident to police, is also considered a ""cooperating witness,"" police said.

On Wednesday, Fox responded to a TMZ story claiming Smollett's scenes on the show were ""getting slashed"" from nine to four.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement.

Fox had no comment after police announced Smollett was a suspect Wednesday.

In his first interview about the incident last week, the actor told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was angry about the alleged attack and that people were doubting him.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" Smollett said."

Detectives were this evening presenting evidence before a Grand Jury in Chicago, a police spokesperson said.

Smollett had previously said that he had been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago late last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said earlier that two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects in the attack were also to testify before the grand jury.

Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier this afternoon.

It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The lawyers didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show Empire, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2am on 29 January as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago.

He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments, and yelled “This is MAGA country” – an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” – before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

The supposed attack prompted celebrities and politicians to come out in solidarity with Smollett, including Democratic candidates Senator Kamala Harris and Cory Booker who both compared it to a modern-day lynching.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement earlier today saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show.

The statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn’t find footage of the beating.

They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

Last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack.

They also searched the men’s apartment.

Identified

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their lawyer as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday.

Police spokesperson Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday he said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

He also said detectives had requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hadn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimised” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf”.

She didn’t respond to a request for comment yesterday.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation yesterday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokesperson.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” the spokesperson said.

She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment.

Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said.

Mr. Smollett had received an immediate outpouring of public support. Many cited his account as an example of another in a rising tide of hate crimes, which the F.B.I. reported last fall had increased for the third straight year.

But the change in thinking by investigators as the case progressed began to unleash criticism against the news media and politicians who many critics said were too quick to embrace a sketchy account in their drive to tarnish the president. It became a nightly topic on Fox News for Tucker Carlson, who called it a case of identity politics run amok. “Identity politics is a scam,” he said, “and it is not so different from the one that Jussie Smollett just pulled.”

Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review, said on Wednesday: “I think that the initial reaction suggested that there is a lot of credulity, especially among liberals who were looking at a story that seemed to confirm their impressions about Trump supporters.”

Mr. Smollett has continued to vehemently insist the incident occurred just as he reported it.

His lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement that said: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

A spokesman for Smollett told ITK the actor's team had no comment at this time.

Representatives at Fox’s “Empire” didn’t immediately return ITK’s request for comment.

A slew of high-profile lawmakers and 2020 White House hopefuls had spoken out in support of Smollett following his allegations.

Before news of Smollett being named a suspect broke on Wednesday, the team behind ""Empire,"" 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, released a statement of support for the cast member.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set,” the studio said, denying reports that Smollett had been written off the show.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about being attacked on the street, according to Chicago police.

In a tweet early Thursday, the chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that Smollett ""is under arrest and in custody of detectives."" The actor and musician now faces felony criminal charges from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, which has accused him of ""Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.""

In a statement released Wednesday, Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson vowed to ""mount an aggressive defense.""

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Pugh and Henderson said.

The news of Smollett's arrest marks the latest development in a story of controversy and confusion since that began late last month.

Initially, Chicago police revealed that the actor, who is black and gay and portrays a gay character on Empire, had reported suffering a vicious assault while walking downtown in the early morning hours. According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.

The assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a ""possible hate crime,"" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.

The unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.

Early in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as ""potential suspects"" — only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, ""new evidence"" that arose during their interrogations ""had shifted"" the investigation.

And they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.

All the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack — rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having ""no evidence"" — the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.

""At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' "" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' ""

Smollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.

According to the FBI's ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,"" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.

In 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.

“I met @JussieSmollett at the Pride Parade in Los Angeles, and I’ve seen the passion and moral clarity of his activism first hand. This week he was the victim of an horrific attack. We pray for your speedy recovery, Jussie, and reject this act of hatred and bigotry,” Schiff tweeted on Jan. 30.

The tweet is no longer visible on his Twitter account. Its deletion was first reported by The Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra.

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him in the middle of the night as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a noose-like rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett’s story has fallen apart in recent weeks. Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, two black Nigerian men, were arrested last week for the attack but were released without any charges being filed against them.

With Smollett now being accused of filing a false police report, he could face between 1-3 years in prison if he’s convicted.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi also deleted a tweet about Smollett a couple days ago.

Sky News host Andrew Bolt says the media blamed President Trump for the incident, and that similar anti-Trump stories have been publicised in the past, that have since proved fake. Mr Bolt says the 'strange' story should be a warning against people pushing stories they want to believe are true, but which they 'cannot know are true'.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with disorderly conduct, according to reports out of the US.

Filing a false police report is disorderly conduct, a charge which carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years - although if found guilty, he may also receive probation.

Earlier today, a police official confirmed that Chicago detectives suspected that Smollett had filed a false police report when he said he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago late last month.

A bail hearing is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, according to CNN.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also tweeted Wednesday that detectives and two brothers who were initially deemed suspects in the Jan. 29 attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays Jamal Lyon on the hit US TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2am on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement Wednesday saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show. The statement follows reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn’t find footage of the beating. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men’s apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their lawyer as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday, he said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He also said detectives had requested another interview with Smollett. The Osundairos’ lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimised” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” She didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation Tuesday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokeswoman.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment. Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett's attorneys to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender,"" Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

""We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we're hoping he does the same,"" Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account - something police signaled Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" - before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to ""lock in their testimony.""

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that ""it doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Earlier this week, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled by her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

The announcement comes after surveillance footage surfaced showing two Nigerian brothers connected to Smollet through the TV show “Empire” purchasing ski masks and red hats likened to President Trump’s iconic Make America Great Again hats.

CNN reported Saturday that Smollett staged the attack where he claimed two white Trump supporters in MAGA hats punched him, tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him while hurling racial slurs, after the Nigerian brother confessed to authorities that Smollett paid them $3,500 each to stage a racial attack to demonize Trump supporters.

The brothers also confessed that Smollett staged the hate crime hoax after sending a letter with a white substance to the Empire studio.

According to local reports, an indictment against Smollett could be coming in “hours.”

Falsifying a police report is a Class 4 felony in Chicago, and if found guilty Smollett could face up to 3 years in prison.

“If it is determined that a person lied to police about a crime that was committed, they could be charged with a Class 4 Felony ‘Disorderly conduct,'” former prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said Wednesday.

Empire star Jussie Smollett is now being considered as a suspect for filing a “false police report”.

The US star, 36, alleged he was the victim of a racially motivated and homophobic attack, in which he was beaten and had a noose looped around his neck.

However, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department has now confirmed the star is being treated as a suspect in the case and officers will present evidence to a grand jury.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men when returning home from a Subway at 2am on January 29, was forced to flee and taken to hospital. He claimed racist and homophobic insults were hurled at him.

It had been previously said that information on the case had “shifted”, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett has so far refused to meet with police a second time ever since investigators began looking at the possibility that the attack Smollett reported may have been staged.

Police opened a hate crime investigation Jan. 29 after Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed he was assaulted by two white men who shouted racial slurs, poured a chemical on him, and put a noose around his neck. Smollett also said the men told him this was ""MAGA country,"" a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Two Nigerian-American brothers were brought in by police after being identified as the possible suspects, but were released without charges on Jan. 15 and said in a statement released by their lawyer that they were fully cooperating with police.

Police sources told CNN the two had been paid thousands of dollars by Smollett to stage the attack, an accusation that Smollett denied through his lawyers. Records show the brothers bought the rope at a local hardware store.

Earlier in the day Tuesday, the brothers, identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, met with investigators and prosecutors on Tuesday and the head prosecutor of Cook County recused herself from the investigation citing ""familiarity"" with a potential witness in the case.

Smollett's lawyers confirmed they were keeping an ""open dialogue"" with police, but said they were not allowing police to speak directly with him. There's no information about whether Smollett has been taken into custody yet or not."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted an update on the progress of the investigation, writing: “Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony).

“Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

It had been previously said that information on the case had “shifted”, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett, who like his character Jamal Lyon is black and gay, said he was attacked by two masked men who yelled “this is MAGA country” during their alleged assault.

Legal representatives of Smollett responded to prior claims that the attack may have been orchestrated.

They said in a statement: “Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

9 Chief communications officer for Chicago Police tweeted an update over the alleged fake attack

Showbiz stars rallied round in support after the alleged attack in Chicago last month.

But cops raised concerns over the gay black actor's story - amid suggestions he staged it in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

In a sensational development on Wednesday night, Chicago Police announced Smollett had been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter: ""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.

""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

This morning Guglielmi added: ""Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives.""

Detectives will give further details at 9am local time before the actor makes his first appearance in court later today.

CCTV BOMBSHELL

Smollett could face up to three years in prison if convicted under Illinois law.

Responding to the charge, Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said they planned to mount an ""aggressive defence"".

In a joint statement, they said: ""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

The charge came after new CCTV footage emerged showing two brothers with links to Smollett buying ski masks, bandannas and red hats just a day before the ""attack"".

Empire extras Ola Osundairo, 27, and brother Abimbola, 25, were allegedly paid more than £3,000 by the actor to attack him, according to several US reports.

On Wednesday they appeared before a Grand Jury - which decides whether to bring charges in big cases - for two and a half hours to testify against Smollett.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt later told reporters they laid out how Smollett ""put them up to the fake assault"", TMZ reported.

CELEB SUPPORT

Moments before the charges were announced, Schmidt added that Smollet's conscience ""won't let him sleep so he should come clean.""

The shocking twist in the case comes just days after A-list celebs flooded social media with their support for the 36-year-old.

Brit catwalk queen Naomi Campbell — who previously starred in hip-hop drama Empire — was one of the first to leap to Smollett’s defence.

Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on Chicago’s mayor to catch the “despicable people” who had committed this “act of hate”.

Oscar-winner Viola Davis also shared a photo of the actor on Instagram, saying: “OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate!

“We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved!”

And TV host Ellen DeGeneres, referring to an interview when the actor revealed he was gay, said: “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck Jussie Smollett

Smollett, who was treated in hospital, had initially told police that his ""attackers"" were yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

And they made reference to ""MAGA"" - the “Make America Great Again” election catchphrase used by President Trump - the actor alleged.

Last week, a tearful Smollett told Good Morning America that he was attacked at 2am while speaking on the phone to his manager.

He said: ""While I was on the phone I heard . . . I was crossing the intersection . . . I heard ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire.”

Smollett, who first rose to prominence in 1992 children’s movie The Mighty Ducks, then said he heard one of them utter a racial slur.

He said: “So I turned around and said, ‘What the f*** did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker masked.”

Getting emotional, Smollett continued: “He said: ‘This MAGA country n*****’. And he punched me in the face so I punched his ass back.”

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back.



DOUBTS SWIRL

The actor claimed his attackers ran off then saw his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager Brandon Moore was still on the line and Smollett said he told Brandon he had been jumped.

Then, looking down, Smollett claimed he saw a rope.

He said: “I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck.’ ”

Choking up, Smollett added: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

But doubts about the authenticity of the attack were quickly raised after the actor refused to hand over his phone to detectives.

Cops were also curious as to why the rope was still around Smollett's neck when they arrived on the scene 30 minutes later.

He also asked responding officers to turn off their body cameras and come into his apartment — because he said he did not want neighbours witnessing the scene.

But frustrated Smollett insisted: ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

But his story seemingly unravelled after cops arrested two black men with connections to him.

The Osundairo brothers were held last week after leaving the US for a holiday in Nigeria just days after the alleged attack.

Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

Cops are now understood to believe the star paid the men £2,700 to attack him and £390 when they returned from Nigeria.

Sources earlier told website TMZ the trio even REHEARSED the assault.

Following their release last week, the two brothers would only say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump.”

The “Empire” star has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was attacked January 29 around 2 a.m. outside his Chicago apartment building by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, leaving him with a rope around his neck.

Since Jussie reported the incident last month, sources have come forward telling TMZ that Smollett planned and staged the attack with brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Spokesperson of the Chicago Police Department, tweeted Wednesday, “Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony).”

Guglielmi also confirmed evidence is now being presented to a Cook County grand jury.

Earlier in the day, CNN reported that Jussie’s attorneys had met with the Cook County prosecutor, and that police are seeking the star’s financial records.

The Osundairo brothers, who had been identified from surveillance video near the scene, were arrested Wednesday and held by police for two days. They were not charged.

CBS 2 reported that Olabinjo and Abimbola were paid $3,500 for their part in the attack. They left for Nigeria the night it happened, and were reportedly supposed to receive another $500 upon their return.

A video obtained by the news station shows the brothers buying items allegedly used in the staged attack, including a red hat and ski masks.

Sources previously told TMZ that the two men have agreed to appear before the grand jury, and have not been subpoenaed.

Olabinjo and Abimbola spoke to CBS 2 exclusively saying, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Olabinjo has appeared on “Empire” as an extra. Jussie’s attorneys have also stated that one of the men had worked for the star as a personal trainer.

CBS 2 reports multiple sources claim Jussie was upset that a threatening letter sent to him at FOX Studios in Chicago didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” and that’s why he allegedly staged the attack.

ThatGrapeJuice.net

The note, posted by ThatGrapeJuice.net, stated in letters cut out of magazines, “You will die black f**.” The letter was delivered January 22, over a week before the attack. It reportedly included a white powder that turned out to be aspirin.

CBS 2 says Chicago police found a magazine at the Osundairos’ apartment, which was taken as evidence.

On Saturday, Smollett's lawyers told “Extra” in a statement that Jussie was “angered and devastated” by reports he knew the attackers, and that he now feels “further victimized.”"

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Police were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve Smollett turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

He said he did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released.

The next day, police said the men provided information that had ”shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

READ MORE: 2 men questioned in Jussie Smollett case released without charge

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport. For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Also Wednesday, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

The case of the US actor's alleged assault has taken an unexpected turn after reports surfaced that the actor may have orchestrated the attack himself

According to Smollett, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox Broadcasting Company's ""Empire,"" two perpetrators, who were wearing ski masks, yelled, ""Aren't you that f****t 'Empire' n*****?"" before attacking him, Sputnik previously reported.

They also yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before walking away from the scene of the crime. MAGA is shorthand for US President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

However, on Saturday, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the case told CNN that they believe Smollett paid two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo (who were extras on the set of ""Empire"") to stage the assault.

According to the brothers, who were arrested and questioned by the Chicago Police Department last week, Smollett decided to stage the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter he had previously received did not generate enough attention, a Chicago Police Department official told ABC News Monday.

Also earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television released a statement stating that Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character isn't being written off the show, after reports surfaced this week that he might be fired from the series."

“We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved!”

And TV host Ellen DeGeneres, referring to an interview when the actor revealed he was gay, said: “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck Jussie Smollett

Smollett, who was treated in hospital, had initially told police that his ""attackers"" were yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

And they made reference to ""MAGA"" - the “Make America Great Again” election catchphrase used by President Trump - the actor alleged.

Last week, a tearful Smollett told Good Morning America that he was attacked at 2am while speaking on the phone to his manager.

He said: ""While I was on the phone I heard . . . I was crossing the intersection . . . I heard ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire.”

Smollett, who first rose to prominence in 1992 children’s movie The Mighty Ducks, then said he heard one of them utter a racial slur.

He said: “So I turned around and said, ‘What the f*** did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker masked.”

Getting emotional, Smollett continued: “He said: ‘This MAGA country n*****’. And he punched me in the face so I punched his ass back.”

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back.



DOUBTS SWIRL

The actor claimed his attackers ran off then saw his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager Brandon Moore was still on the line and Smollett said he told Brandon he had been jumped.

Then, looking down, Smollett claimed he saw a rope.

He said: “I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck.’ ”

Choking up, Smollett added: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

But doubts about the authenticity of the attack were quickly raised after the actor refused to hand over his phone to detectives.

Cops were also curious as to why the rope was still around Smollett's neck when they arrived on the scene 30 minutes later.

He also asked responding officers to turn off their body cameras and come into his apartment — because he said he did not want neighbours witnessing the scene.

But frustrated Smollett insisted: ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

But his story seemingly unravelled after cops arrested two black men with connections to him.

The Osundairo brothers were held last week after leaving the US for a holiday in Nigeria just days after the alleged attack.

Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

Cops are now understood to believe the star paid the men £2,700 to attack him and £390 when they returned from Nigeria.

Following their release last week, the two brothers would only say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump.”

(CHICAGO) — Empire star Jussie Smollett, who claimed he was assaulted on January 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs, is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago police.

According to a tweet by Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, Smollett will be charged with filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony. Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.

The news comes after Chicago police continued their investigation into the alleged attack on the Empire actor. ABC News confirmed that police and prosecutors met with Smollett’s attorneys in Chicago on Wednesday.

Guglielmi said that no evidence had been presented to a grand jury on behalf of the Smollett case on Tuesday. He also said he could not confirm reports that half a dozen subpoenas seeking Smollett’s cell phone and bank records have been issued.

Despite an initial report that Smollett was being written out of Empire, Fox has released a statement on Wednesday confirming that Smollett is still an important part of the series.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” said Fox and 20th Century Fox TV in a statement to ABC News.

The statement was issued prior to Smollett being named a suspect.

Two brothers known to Smollett have reportedly told police that the actor paid them to orchestrate and carry out the attack. According to the brothers, Smollett was upset because a threatening letter directed at him, sent to Empire’s Chicago studios on January 22, wasn’t being taken seriously enough.

The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending the threatening letter himself, two federal officials confirmed to ABC News.

Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — After weeks of investigation into Jussie Smollett’s claim of being attacked last month by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs while physically beating him and leaving him with a rope tied around his neck, the Chicago Police Department officially classified Smollett as a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation for filing a false report.

The announcement, in a tweet from the Chicago Police Department’s verified account, represents another stunning twist in an investigation that has seen more than its share of such developments.

The tweet also announced that detectives are presenting evidence to a grand jury.

While Chicago police officials confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that authorities are maintaining a dialogue with Jussie Smollett’s attorneys, they remain anxious to re-interview the actor himself.

“We are hopeful that we’ll have a chance to ask the questions that we have,” says Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“It doesn’t matter what the investigation shows,” Guglielmi said. “If you have information that’s helpful to law enforcement, it behooves you to contact authorities and share that information. We have been very diplomatic and have been working with him and his attorneys. We got information, and that’s what we want to run by him.”

If Smollett does not come in to speak with police, he said, “We’re going to go with other methods to create a culture of accountability.”

Later Wednesday, an official briefed on the Smollett investigation confirmed to ABC News that attorneys representing Smollett met with police and prosecutors in Chicago today. Lawyers and police would not immediately detail the substance of the discussion.

The CPD’s latest public stance comes after two federal officials confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed, prior to the alleged Jan. 29 attack.

The letter, which was sent Jan. 22, is currently in an FBI crime lab for analysis, one of the sources said.

The allegation concerning the alleged attack and the letter — made by brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who are cooperating with investigators in the probe — has not been officially confirmed.

The Osundairo brothers have also told investigators that Smollett paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the Jan. 29 attack that Smollett said occurred near his Chicago apartment, sources said. Police have not independently verified these allegations and no one has been charged in connection with the case.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett told police that on Jan. 29, he was walking on a street near his apartment around 2 a.m. when he was set upon by two men. The attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs before hitting him, pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him —- possibly bleach -— and wrapping a rope around his neck, he told detectives.

A Chicago police spokesman officially confirmed that detectives are in the process of presenting relevant evidence to a grand jury.

“Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury,” tweeted police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

If Smollett is charged with a felony in the case, he could face up to three years in prison.

The actor, who plays Jamal Lyon on Fox Television’s Empire, claimed he was assaulted in the early morning hours on January 29 while he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. Smollett claims that a group of men beat him and while in the process screamed racist and homophobic slurs at him. He further claimed that the men yelled “This is MAGA country” – in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” – and then looped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene.

However, a pair of brothers has reportedly told TMZ that Smollett staged the attack, and they are said to have been at the courthouse and expected to testify today. Furthermore, the duo claims that Smollett paid them $3,500 before the attack. While TMZ reports that “sources connected to Smollett” say that the payment was for workout sessions and help with a dietary regimen, the brothers have reportedly said that Smollett paid far more than they were owed. And while the brothers haven’t claimed that Smollett overtly instructed them to administer the staged beating, they claim that the implication was clear.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, police combed through hundreds of hours of public and private CCTV footage from the area where Smollett claims the attack took place but found no evidence of it. Further, THR reports that a pair of brothers were picked up by police at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport upon returning from a trip to Nigeria, and were taken in for questioning. And on Saturday, police spokesman Guglielmi did say that the two men had been released and had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

A spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers did not comment on the developments in the case except to say that they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”"

About 15 minutes before Guglielmi announced the case was before a grand jury, reporter Rob Elgas of ABC7 in Chicago said the Osundairo brothers were seen entering the grand jury room with their attorneys:

BREAKING: Our news crew spots Chicago brothers and their attorney in Smollett investigation at courthouse entering a grand jury room. Unclear if they are actually testifying before a grand jury. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 20, 2019

As noted earlier, the brothers were expected to testify before the grand jury yesterday but that was called off after a last-minute phone call from Smollett’s lawyers. Today, those lawyers met with police investigators to discuss the case. From the Chicago Sun-Times:

Lawyers for Jussie Smollett are meeting with Cook County prosecutors and police investigators about the reported attack on the “Empire” actor late last month. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Associated Press that the meeting was taking place Wednesday afternoon. He declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for Smollett’s phone and bank records.

Another minor development which will undoubtedly be part of the case against Smollett. CBS Chicago’s Charlie DeMar found video of the Osundairo brothers buying items used during the attack on Smollett including a red hat and ski masks.

EXCLUSIVE: I tracked down surveillance of the Osundairo's buying supplies before ""attack"" Sources say Jussie Smollet told brothers what to buy. Countless phone calls placed for this.

Of course, the fact that the brothers bought the items used in the attack doesn’t prove Smollett was in on it but the red hat, in particular, seems to fit pretty well with the idea that this was staged to look like a hate crime by Trump supporters. Would the brothers have come up with that on their own? And if so, why did Smollett claim his attackers were white? It will be interesting to see how attorney Mark Geragos spins that as some kind of mistake.

CHICAGO – “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorder conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into the Jan. 29 beating.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account – something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” – an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” – before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released.

The next day, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients, who received money from Smollett, did not care about a plea deal or immunity.

“You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record – one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport. For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Also Wednesday, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago Police for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),"" Guglielmi posted. ""Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told authorities he was attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The actor reportedly paid two brothers to attack him a week later and frame it as a racist and homophobic assault, WLS-TV, ABC 7 in Chicago reported.

Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo worked on ""Empire"" as extras and one was reportedly Smollett's personal trainer.

Following the reported attack, Smollett's colleagues, employer, civil and gay rights leaders, legislators and President Donald Trump expressed support and outrage at the attack that the actor described."

This turn of events in the investigation comes a little over three weeks after the actor/singer alleged to authorities that he was the victim of an attack on January 29 by the two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,"" who proceeded to pour ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene. At the time of the assault, Chicago Police announced that the attack was being treated as a ""possible hate crime.""

Here is a look at the the original tweet from Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Guglielmi, made public late Wednesday afternoon:

Last Thursday, ABC's Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett where the actor/singer went into detail about the assualt and what life has been like for him since that time. Speaking with interviewer/GMA co-host Robin Roberts, Smollett had this to say when asked about allegation being made that the attack was a hoax:

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

Portraying the character of Jamal Lyon on FOX's long-running and popular prime-time drama Empire since its premiere, the award-winning actor/singer was in Chicago the weekend of the alleged attack to prepare for a concert he was set to perform."

On Wednesday, Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that Smollett “is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

Smollett has consistently denied that he orchestrated the attack—but as the case has progressed, its details have become muddier and muddier. Police sources have told various news outlets that they believe Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers, who were previously arrested as suspects, to stage the incident. TMZ has also reported that the actor’s role on Empire has been reduced in the wake of the controversy. When reached by V.F. on Tuesday, a representative for Fox declined to comment—although on Wednesday, before the news broke that Smollett had been classified as a suspect, the network released its second statement in support of Smollett.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” Fox said in its latest statement. In its initial reaction to Smollett’s attack in January, the network wrote, “We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our Empire family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network, and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate—and especially against one of our own.”

The discussion surrounding Smollett, meanwhile, has shifted as well. In earlier weeks, celebrities rallied around the actor; now, reactions to the attack and its aftermath are more confused and pensive. As Trevor Noah put it Tuesday night during a “Between the Scenes” clip for The Daily Show, “I don’t know what the details of the Jussie Smollett story are going to end up being. What I do know is right now, the story just doesn’t make sense in the pieces that it’s laid out as. I’m not saying that he is lying; I’m just saying that his story doesn’t seem to line up with what’s happening.”

Representatives for Smollett did not immediately respond to V.F.’s request for comment.

9 Chief communications officer for Chicago Police tweeted an update over the alleged fake attack

Showbiz stars rallied round in support after the alleged attack in Chicago last month.

But cops raised concerns over the gay black actor's story - amid suggestions he staged it in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

In a sensational development on Wednesday night, Chicago Police announced Smollett had been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter: ""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report.

""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

This morning Guglielmi added: ""Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives.""

Detectives will give further details at 9am local time before the actor makes his first appearance in court later today.

CCTV BOMBSHELL

Smollett could face up to three years in prison if convicted under Illinois law.

Responding to the charge, Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said they planned to mount an ""aggressive defence"".

In a joint statement, they said: ""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

The charge came after new CCTV footage emerged showing two brothers with links to Smollett buying ski masks, bandannas and red hats just a day before the ""attack"".

Empire extras Ola Osundairo, 27, and brother Abimbola, 25, were allegedly paid more than £3,000 by the actor to attack him, according to several US reports.

On Wednesday they appeared before a Grand Jury - which decides whether to bring charges in big cases - for two and a half hours to testify against Smollett.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt later told reporters they laid out how Smollett ""put them up to the fake assault"", TMZ reported.

CELEB SUPPORT

Moments before the charges were announced, Schmidt added that Smollet's conscience ""won't let him sleep so he should come clean.""

The shocking twist in the case comes just days after A-list celebs flooded social media with their support for the 36-year-old.

Brit catwalk queen Naomi Campbell — who previously starred in hip-hop drama Empire — was one of the first to leap to Smollett’s defence.

Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on Chicago’s mayor to catch the “despicable people” who had committed this “act of hate”.

Oscar-winner Viola Davis also shared a photo of the actor on Instagram, saying: “OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate!

“We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved!”

And TV host Ellen DeGeneres, referring to an interview when the actor revealed he was gay, said: “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck Jussie Smollett

Smollett, who was treated in hospital, had initially told police that his ""attackers"" were yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

And they made reference to ""MAGA"" - the “Make America Great Again” election catchphrase used by President Trump - the actor alleged.

Last week, a tearful Smollett told Good Morning America that he was attacked at 2am while speaking on the phone to his manager.

He said: ""While I was on the phone I heard . . . I was crossing the intersection . . . I heard ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire.”

Smollett, who first rose to prominence in 1992 children’s movie The Mighty Ducks, then said he heard one of them utter a racial slur.

He said: “So I turned around and said, ‘What the f*** did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker masked.”

Getting emotional, Smollett continued: “He said: ‘This MAGA country n*****’. And he punched me in the face so I punched his ass back.”

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back.



DOUBTS SWIRL

The actor claimed his attackers ran off then saw his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager Brandon Moore was still on the line and Smollett said he told Brandon he had been jumped.

Then, looking down, Smollett claimed he saw a rope.

He said: “I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck.’ ”

Choking up, Smollett added: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

But doubts about the authenticity of the attack were quickly raised after the actor refused to hand over his phone to detectives.

Cops were also curious as to why the rope was still around Smollett's neck when they arrived on the scene 30 minutes later.

He also asked responding officers to turn off their body cameras and come into his apartment — because he said he did not want neighbours witnessing the scene.

But frustrated Smollett insisted: ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.”

But his story seemingly unravelled after cops arrested two black men with connections to him.

The Osundairo brothers were held last week after leaving the US for a holiday in Nigeria just days after the alleged attack.

Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

Cops are now understood to believe the star paid the men £2,700 to attack him and £390 when they returned from Nigeria.

Sources earlier told website TMZ the trio even REHEARSED the assault.

Following their release last week, the two brothers would only say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump.”

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also said Wednesday that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects in the Jan. 29 attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement earlier Wednesday saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show. The statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn’t find footage of the beating. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men’s apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday, he said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He also said detectives had requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” She didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation Tuesday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokeswoman.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment. Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said.

UPDATE: Jussie Smollett turned himself in to central booking Thursday morning, where he was arrested, the Associated Press reports. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has approved felony charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report, per CNN. A bail hearing is scheduled for Thursday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. CT.

UPDATE: According to multiple reports, actor-singer Jussie Smollett was charged by local prosecutors for filing a false report in relation to his alleged assault late last month. The actor is expected in bond court on Thursday, February 21. According to The Advocate, the actor faces one to three years if found guilty, as the charge is a Class 4 felony.

ORIGINAL: Empire actor Jussie Smollett is now officially a suspect in the police investigation into his alleged January attack.

In a statement on Twitter, Chicago Police Department chief communication officer Anthony Guglielmi stated that the actor has been named a suspect in a criminal investigation.

“Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago Police for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” Guglielmi tweeted. “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

This latest news comes only one day after brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, two brothers allegedly involved in Smollett’s attack, met with prosecutors. The two men were also reportedly located in a ride-sharing car near the scene of the incident.

According to ABC13, Smollett’s attorneys are currently speaking with prosecutors. Guglielmi did not confirm reports that police have subpoenaed Smollett’s phone and bank records.

Smollett’s alleged attack happened in the early hours of Sunday, January 29. Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men who yelled that this was “MAGA country,” subsequently beaten, and had a chemical substance poured on him. One of the brothers involved in the alleged attack knew Smollett from working as an extra on Empire, according to a Sunday CNN report. The report also claims that Chicago police had begun to investigate whether Smollett was involved in orchestrating the attack.

Smollett has faced myriad rumors that he was somehow involved with the attack and has denied each hoax claim that comes forward. 20th Century Fox has likewise stood by Smollett in a statement when rumors emerged that he was being written off Empire.

Before the attack, Smollett also sent a letter that threatened him to the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is shot, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, turned himself in Thursday to face accusations that he filed a false police report last month when he told authorities he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

The actor “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson told reporters at a news conference.

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve,” he added.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to two brothers who helped him stage the attack, including giving them specific slurs to yell and telling them to shout “MAGA country” and to drape a rope around his neck.

Smollett even pointed out to the men a specific surveillance camera that he thought would capture footage of the beating, Assistant State’s Attorney Risa Lanier told a news conference. Police say the camera was pointed another way.

At Smollett’s first court appearance, a judge set bond at $100,000, meaning that he must post $10,000 to be released. Smollett’s attorneys asked for him to be released on his own recognizance, but the judge, who is also black, said that was inappropriate and that he was particularly bothered by the allegations involving the noose Smollett’s neck.

Smollett said little during the hearing, except to state his name. He was joined in the courtroom by family members.

The FBI has been investigating the letter. Johnson would not say whether Smollett could face additional charges for that.

The companies that make “Empire,” Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, issued a statement Thursday saying that they were ‘evaluating the situation” and “considering our options.”

In less than a month, Smollett went from being the seemingly sympathetic victim of a hate crime to being accused of fabricating the entire thing. The 36-year-old was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct, a charge that could bring up to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Police treated Smollett as a victim until the two brothers, who had been taken into custody for questioning, admitted to helping him stage the attack, Johnson said.

It was the brothers who also explained Smollett’s motive to detectives. Authorities have a check for $3,500 that Smollett paid the brothers, he said.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a downtown Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” – an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” – before fleeing.

In describing what police believe actually happened, Johnson made it sound as if Smollett was casting and directing a short movie.

“He probably knew he needed somebody with bulk,” he said of Smollett’s decision to hire the two muscular brothers. Police have said at least one of the brothers worked on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer.

When it came time to stage the attack, Johnson said, Smollett chose a spot that he believed would be captured by one of Chicago’s many security cameras. But “that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction,” Johnson said.

The brothers, who are not considered suspects, wore gloves during the staged attack and “punched him a little bit,” Johnson said. The scratches and bruising Smollett had on his face were”`most likely self-inflicted,” Johnson said.

In a statement Wednesday, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

Detectives found the two brothers after reviewing hundreds of hours of video. They released images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the pair at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The two appeared before a grand jury on Wednesday to “lock in their testimony,” according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, Trump said last month that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.” On Thursday, he tweeted to Smollett: “What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? MAGA.”

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record – one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program."

UPDATE 1: Late on Wednesday, Feb. 20, the Cook County State Attorney’s Office indicted Jussie Smollett on felony charges of filing a false police report. Chicago PD’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted out the following: “Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

ORIGINAL: After weeks of intense speculation, Chicago police are officially accusing Empire star Jussie Smollett, 36, of helping to stage an alleged hate attack against him. CPD’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted on Feb. 20 “Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by # ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.” TMZ reports that brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo – who allegedly helped Jussie stage the attack – are at the courthouse and prepared to testify against the actor. If he ends up getting charged with filing a false police report, Jussie could face up to three years in prison for the felony charge.

Jussie, however, has consistently denied that the incident was a hoax, that he had any involvement in staging it and insists that he was the victim of a hate crime at the hands of two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. The story has taken a series of twists and turns ever since Jussie told police that he was attacked by two white men in the early hours of Jan. 29 in Downtown Chicago. The actor who – like his character on the hit Fox show – is black and gay, claimed that the strangers punched, kicked, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed that they told him that this is “MAGA country,” which suggests that they are supporters of President Donald Trump and his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.

“I can’t tell you what color their eyes were… and I did not see anything except the second person I saw running away,” Jussie told Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts during a Feb. 13 interview. “And the first person, yeah, I saw his stature. I gave the description as best as I could. You have to understand also that it’s Chicago, in winter. People can wear ski masks and nobody’s going to question that.”

But people did question Jussie’s account of what happened and, days later, multiple outlets (including CNN) published reports that unnamed police sources said they believe that Jussie conspired with the two brothers to orchestrate an elaborate hoax. The two men in question were arrested on Feb. 13 and brought in for questioning but released without charge on Feb. 15 “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations,” Chicago PD Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said. Police also revealed that one of the two men had appeared as an extra on Empire. and one had worked as Jussie’s trainer.

Jussie has insisted throughout the investigation that he is a victim, not someone who conspired to stage a fake attack. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” lawyers for the star said in a Feb. 16 statement, according to The New York Times. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

On January 29, Smollett alleged that he was attacked in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood, in what was initially investigated as a hate crime. Police later alleged Smollett orchestrated the attack.

Shortly before Smollett was named as a suspect, the two brothers accused of conspiring with him to orchestrate the fake hate crime attack are seen on surveillance video apparently buying items used during the incident.

The video shows Ola and Abel Osundairo placing the masks and at least one hat on the counter.

Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two white men in ski masks who made racial and homophobic slurs, and said “This is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” and used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault.

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then “poured an unknown liquid” on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.

Smollett was not seriously injured.

Upcoming episodes of ‘Empire’ have been rewritten to reduce Smollett’s role.

Chicago police have announced this afternoon that Smollett has been named a suspect in a criminal investigation. Detectives will present evidence to a grand jury to determine whether or not to indict the actor on a charge for filing a false police report.

Originally, Smollett alleged that two men assaulted him on Jan. 29 by pouring chemicals on him and tying a noose around his neck while shouting racial and homophobic slurs. Since then, rumors have spread that the assault was a hoax and that Smollett staged it, but Chicago police said those reports are “unconfirmed.” Smollett has stuck to his story and Fox Entertainment, the company behind “Empire,” has stood by the actor’s original claims and dismissed rumors that Smollett’s character was going to be written off the show.

***UPDATE***

Jussie Smollett has been charged with a crime. The Associated Press reports that Jussie’s charged with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting an attack on Jan. 29. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years or probation.

The news comes after his alleged “attackers” testified for 2 1/2 hours before a grand jury today, Wednesday, Feb. 20.

AP reports that the men in question, brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, told their attorney Gloria Schmidt that they wanted to “man up” and “correct this” before giving their testimony.

Jussie’s attorneys have released a statement and they’re imploring that he’s considered innocent until proven guilty. They’re also promising an “aggressive defense” of the actor.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

This story is still developing…

***END UPDATE***

The chief communications officer from the Chicago Police department has confirmed today Jussie Smollett is now being investigated as a criminal.

Anthony Guglielmi wrote in a tweet: “Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by # ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

Previously, Jussie filed a report saying he was the victim of a completely random racist and homophobic attack as he walked to a Subway in Chicago. As evidence unfolds, the details of the attack seem to make less and less sense to investigators. Today, before a Grand Jury, Chicago Detectives presented evidence that the “attack” may have been staged. Two Nigerian brothers also thwart Jussie’s story during a police interview, claiming he paid them to attack him.

Today, store video of the Nigerian brothers purchasing MAGA hats and ski masks has surfaced. The brothers reportedly told police Jussie asked them to stage the entire attack and this supports their story. CBS Chicago found the footage of them purchasing the items right before they allegedly attacked Jussie.

Smollett has denied any involvement in planning the attack, and in one interview he said that he was ""pissed"" at any insinuation that he was anything but a victim.

The Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he said he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago late last month, Chicago police said on Wednesday.

The police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could carry one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of the beating. Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender”, Guglielmi said.

Lawyers for Smollett said they intended to conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defense. “Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement.

Smollett alleged two masked men abused him with racist and homophobic slurs before beating him up early on 29 January. Smollett, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

But since then details in the case have emerged that have cast doubt on his reported version of events.

Earlier on Wednesday, Guglielmi had announced investigators officially considered the actor a suspect in the case. “Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by # ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” he tweeted.

Guglielmi added that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects in the attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It is unknown what was discussed or whether the actor attended the meeting.

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, had told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2am near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted: “This is Maga country,” an apparent reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city full of surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation”.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character was not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

On Tuesday, Chicago’s top prosecutor, the Cook county state’s attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment.

Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said.

Rather than seek another interview with the actor, Chicago PD will now seek, as CPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi put it, to “negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.” Should he be found guilty, Smollett could spend up to three years behind bars. Smollett’s lawyers have promised “aggressive defense” in light of the charges.

Original post: The twisty-turny and deeply-upsetting-either-way-it-turns-out case of Jussie Smollett has yet to be formally resolved, with key questions still up in the air. But Chicago PD aren’t taking chances. As per Variety, they’ve named the Empire actor and singer — whose claims that he was the victim of a hate crime have in the last week been called into question — as a suspect in another potential crime: filing a false police report.

The alleged incident happened over three weeks ago, and all the while Smollett has stuck by his word, alleging that he was assaulted by two men who shouted homophobic and racist epithets, doused him in bleach, and put a noose around his neck. Last week Chicago PD rounded up and interrogated two suspects. The men, Nigerian brothers, were then released, with police saying they came to believe Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

If that turns out to be true — and, remember, nothing has been proven so far — then this could carry far-reaching implications about how police and especially society (read: social media) respond to future allegations of assault, particularly if they involve claims of bigotry.

It also means Smollett would have committed a Class 4 felony, as per Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi, who tweeted the news that the performer is “now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report,” and that “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

In the meantime, Fox has said they’re sticking by Smollett, despite earlier claims that his Empire scenes were being cut. Others, like The Daily Show host Trevor Noah, are understandably confused.

Embattled Empire actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a “suspect” for filing a false police report, evidence of which has been presented before a grand jury, a Chicago Police Department spokesman announced on Wednesday.

The announcement came after Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives on Wednesday. Smollett initially told police that he was attacked outside of a Subway restaurant at around 2 a.m. on January 29 by two masked men who allegedly beat him, poured an unknown chemical on him, and placed a noose around his neck. Smollett later added that the men had yelled, “This is MAGA country” as they fled, a detail he reported only after TMZ claimed it had taken place.

Chicago police announced last Friday that the focus of their investigation had “shifted” after interviewing two Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked as an extra on Empire, and both of whom claimed that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. The brothers also told police that Smollett was motivated to stage the attack after he sent himself a threatening a letter and did not receive the attention from co-workers and fans that he believed the letter warranted.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” the brothers said in a statement provided to CBS Chicago on February 19.

Smollett has repeatedly denied that he staged the attack and has maintained that he was the victim of a hate crime.

Cook County state’s attorney Kim Foxx, Chicago’s top prosecutor, recused herself from the Smollett investigation on Tuesday, citing “familiarity with potential witnesses.”

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said.

Filing a false police report is a class-four felony and typically results in a prison sentence of one to three years.

A grand jury heard evidence in the case and found probable cause that the ""Empire"" actor staged the incident, which he portrayed as a hate crime.

Smollett is charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct. He's due in court Thursday.

He had told police he was brutally attacked by two men as he walked home in the early hours of Jan. 29. He said they yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him before putting a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene.

There had been skepticism over his account, but Smollett has maintained he had nothing to do with the alleged attack. His attorneys say he's ""angered and devastated"" by the allegations he paid two men to stage the incident.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” his attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement prior to the charge being filed Wednesday evening.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox, the network behind ""Empire,"" said it was standing by him.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" Fox said in a statement shared before police released the new information.

Inside Edition learned earlier Wednesday that Smollett was once prosecuted for lying to police in Los Angeles about his name, telling officers who pulled him over he was actually named ""Jake"" — his younger brother's name, court records show. He pleaded no contest in the case and was put on probation.

Smollett sought medical and police assistance after the alleged attack in the early hours of January 29.

The actor said that two men approached him in the dead of night, and hurled both racist and homophobic remarks at him.

He also said that the men beat him, poured a substance over him, and put a noose around his neck.

Two suspects were later hauled in for questioning and were released without charge, but multiple reports have emerged that Jussie paid the two men to stage the attack because he was supposedly being written off Empire.

Smollett's lawyers were quick to issue a statement over the weekend when the case started to take a turn to deny Smollett had any part in the planning of the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement released on Saturday reads.

However, Fox released a statement earlier today and confirmed the actor was not being written out of the show.

By Dan Whitcomb and Gina Cherelus

(Reuters) - Actor Jussie Smollett was charged on Wednesday with lying to police when he claimed he was attacked and beaten on the streets of Chicago by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs, police said on Wednesday as they sought his arrest.

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

The New York Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a written statement.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces ""Empire,"" declined comment when told earlier on Wednesday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""

'MAGA COUNTRY'

Smollett has stood by his account even as police failed to find any evidence of an assault and suspicions grew on social media that it was a hoax.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognized from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

TV station CBS Chicago on Wednesday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

Smollett told police his assailants were white, that one wore a red hat, and that they shouted something about ""MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" - as they struck him to the ground, the New York Times has reported.

Chicago police say the charge of filing a false police report carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.

""Empire"" has earned multiple Emmy nominations since its 2015 debut. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Police named Smollett as a suspect after confirming to PEOPLE that he was questioned again Wednesday by prosecutors from the Cook County District Attorney’s Office.

The initial report about the alleged attack raised alarm: The openly gay black actor, singer and activist, told police he’d been physically attacked on the street in his downtown Chicago neighborhood around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two black-clad, masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs, doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” and left him with a rope around his neck.

“This is MAGA country,” at least one assailant allegedly said, invoking President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan perceived by some as a discriminatory dismissal of minorities and immigrants. Smollett’s family branded the incident a racial and homophobic hate crime, and others on social media followed suit.

From the start, police conceded they faced challenges verifying Smollett’s report.

Hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage reviewed by authorities included images of Smollett walking on the street. But nothing captured the alleged attack, which the Empire actor, 36, said occurred after he left a 24-hour Subway restaurant near his Streeterville apartment amid one of the city’s coldest spells on record.

The alleged incident also followed reports that Smollett had been the target of a threatening letter mailed to his TV show’s Chicago set, and containing a white powder that was found to be crushed-up aspirin.

As doubts about the Chicago attack began to swirl on social media, Smollett’s family defended him with a statement that insisted “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed.” Smollett said in his own statement on Feb. 1 that he had been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

On Wednesday, shortly before Guglielmi’s tweet about the actor being considered a suspect, Smollett’s brothers Jocqui and Jake shared a statement that read: “Remember to THINK, check your own prejudice, and truly inform yourself before jumping to conclusions and spreading untruths, saying things you’ll regret, and making cruel harmful jokes #justiceforjussie.”

Police previously said the actor had shared only some of the phone records they’d requested, which Smollett said he’d redacted to protect the privacy of his personal contacts.

From the surveillance videos, police obtained and released images of two people on the street they portrayed as “persons of interest.” But after detaining two men on Feb. 13 — they were identified by multiple outlets as Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, at least one of whom had worked on Empire — police released them on Feb. 15 without charges “due to new evidence,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote in a tweet.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” he said in a statement Saturday to the Associated Press.

Police confirmed they’d pursued a tip alleging that Smollett was spotted in the elevator of his apartment building on the night of the attack with the two men, but concluded it was “unfounded,” according to Guglielmi.

But police declined PEOPLE’s request to comment on multiple reports claiming the brothers said they were paid by Smollett to stage the incident, or that they’d rehearsed it.

A spokesman in Chicago for the FBI — which investigates threats delivered through the U.S. Postal Service — also declined PEOPLE’s request on Wednesday to address reports that Smollett might have had a role a part in creating or sending the threatening letter.

Police said that have continued to reach out to the actor for clarification.

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” Guglielmi tweeted on Sunday.

A day earlier, Smollett defended himself against the claims attributed to the brothers while acknowledging that he knew the two men. An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, previously told CBS Chicago that the men know Smollett from working on Empire and occasionally go to the same gym as the actor. She did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” according to a statement from his lawyers. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

As questions about Smollett’s claims continued to reverberate Wednesday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment issued a statement in support of the actor.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” it said.

Smollett’s reps have not returned previous inquiries from PEOPLE. A person answering the phone at the offices of attorney Mark Geragos would not confirm Geragos is representing Smollett."

The video which was posted by CBS2 in Chicago shows the brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo can be seen at the counter with a pile of items that include gloves, bandannas, ski masks, and red hats.

In the video, we also see Abel put his hood on in an attempt to cover his face, however, it’s already too late as he has been clearly noticed.

When arrested and taken in for questioning, both brothers assured the attack was set up by Smollett.

As for the items purchased, it was just the day before the alleged attack happened.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorder conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into the Jan. 29 beating.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released.

The next day, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients, who received money from Smollett, did not care about a plea deal or immunity.

""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport. For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Also Wednesday, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

—

Jussie Smollett has officially been named a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago police for filing a false police report. Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi announced the news on Twitter, adding that “detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.” Filing a false police report is a Class 4 felony in Chicago, which means Smollett could face once to three years in prison if convicted.

Smollett has claimed he was the victim of a hate crime attack on January 29. According to the “Empire” actor, two men shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him before getting physically violent with him, which included dousing him in a chemical substance and putting a noose around his neck. Chicago police originally brought in two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, for questioning but they were released soon after.

According to local Chicago media, the two brothers told detectives investigating the case that Smollett paid them to stage the attack. Chicago police have spent the last couple days examining new evidence and now say Smollett is a suspect for filing a false report about the attack. Smollett has declined to speak to police following the brothers’ release and has denied involvement in staging the attack through a statement made by his attorneys.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Fox issued a statement earlier today showing continued support for the actor, saying he was a “consummate professional on set.” IndieWire has reached out to Smollett’s representative for further comment.

The Nigerian brothers who’ve told cops that “Empire” star Jussie Smollett paid them to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him were escorted into the grand jury offices of a Chicago courthouse on Wednesday afternoon.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were surrounded by about a half-dozen people in civilian clothing as they walked into the secure area of the Leighton Criminal Court Building around 3:45 p.m. local time.

On Tuesday, the Osundairo brothers were about to testify before a grand jury when a last-minute call to the prosecution from Smollett’s defense lawyers postponed their appearances, according to the local CBS News affiliate.

The defense claimed it might have new evidence in the case, CBS 2 reported earlier Wednesday.

Smollett, 36, claims that he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two men who called him “Empire f—-t n—-r,” doused him with a liquid believed to be bleach and looped a rope around his neck.

He also told detectives that the men shouted “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” slogan.

The Osundairo brothers were arrested Feb. 13 but released without charges two days later.

Multiple reports have said they’re cooperating with authorities and have accused Smollett of paying them $3,500 to fake the incident."

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday.

“Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,” he added.

The charge was announced shortly after the Chicago Police Department revealed Smollett was now considered a “suspect” in their investigation into his hate-crime report, which was filed late last month.

“Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” Guglielmi tweeted. “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

According to the Illinois General Assembly, a Class 4 felony stipulates a sentence that is “not less than one year and not more than 3 years.”

Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement Wednesday evening, saying they intend to “conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” they wrote.

Fox, Empire’s network, declined to comment to The Daily Beast about the charges. Sources close to the show told Variety that producers are weighing whether to remove the actor from the cast.

Earlier Wednesday, Smollett’s lawyers met with Cook County prosecutors and police about the reported attack on the actor, authorities confirmed to The Daily Beast Wednesday.

Guglielmi reportedly told ABC 7 Chicago that police don't know where Smollett currently is, and his lawyers have “not shared where he is at this point.”

“We want to do this as peacefully and respectfully as possible,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett alleged that on Jan. 29, two men beat him up, put a rope around his neck, and poured an unknown chemical on him when he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop around 2 a.m. The actor also alleged that he was called homophobic and racist slurs during the incident.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says ‘F----- Empire n-----, this is MAGA country, n-----,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” Smollett said during an interview on Good Morning America last week.

Initially, police investigated the attack as a “possible hate crime,” but could not find video evidence of the incident.

The day after the attack, police released surveillance camera photos that identified two “potential persons of interests” that were eventually brought in and questioned. The two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were released Friday without charges, as questions began to swirl about Smollett’s account of the attack.

While being questioned, the brothers reportedly told police the Empire star paid them $3,500 to help stage the attack—and later reimbursed them for the rope. In a new surveillance video released Wednesday, the brothers appear to be seen buying a red hat and ski masks at a convenience store the day before the alleged assault.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” the brothers said in a statement over the weekend.

On Saturday, Guglielmi confirmed on Twitter the probe had “shifted” to whether the actor had paid the two brothers to stage the assault.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Guglielmi told the Associated Press. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett has repeatedly denied claims he staged the assault, and his lawyers claim the allegations he concocted the incident “further victimize him.”

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the investigation on Tuesday, but did not provide any details for her decision.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said in a statement, without elaborating how the state’s top prosecutor was familiar with anyone in the case."

A conviction for a class 4 felony in Illinois carries a 1-3 year prison sentence and can include fines up to $25,000, according to the state’s general assembly.

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him in the middle of the night as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a noose-like rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett’s story has fallen apart in recent weeks. Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, two black Nigerian men, were arrested last week for the attack only to be released days later without any charges being filed against them.

20th Century Fox announced that they were standing by Smollett earlier Wednesday.

According to a CBS report, Smollett’s lawyers made a last minute call to prosecutors Tuesday, convincing them to postpone a grand jury hearing:

CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar has learned the brothers were waiting outside the grand jury chambers at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse on Tuesday, just minutes from testifying, when the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office got a call from Smollett’s lawyers, claiming they may have new evidence.

Thegatewaypundit.com reports: It is unclear what Jussie Smollett’s lawyers said to prosecutors but they agreed to postpone the proceeding which is leading many people to believe there is a possible plea deal.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx officially recused herself from Jussie Smollet’s case on Tuesday, according to Chicago police.

No explanation was given for Foxx’s decision to recuse herself.

First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats will be the acting state’s attorney for the Smollett inquiry, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement Tuesday, reported NBC Chicago.

-REWIND-

On January 29th, ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett told Chicago Police that two white Trump supporters ambushed him on the streets of Chicago at 2 AM while he was walking back to his apartment following a midnight run to Subway to grab a sandwich.

Smollett alleged the two white males recognized him as the actor from ‘Empire,’ hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

The hate hoax began to unravel after it was revealed two Nigerian brothers, who were also extras on Empire were paid $4,000 to stage the attack.

The FBI and US Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening and racist letter crafted from magazine clippings to the ‘Empire’ studio in Chicago prior to the fake MAGA attack. (screenshot below)

The actor now faces potential charges from the Chicago police. A grand jury is empaneled and hearing evidence.

Actor Jussie Smollett is now a suspect in the criminal investigation of an alleged hate-crime he reported last month. Police believe he filed a false police report at the time of the incident.

Chicago police confirmed the explosive development on Wednesday afternoon. He faces charges related to filing a false report with Chicago police, which is a Class 4 felony.

Police have yet to release more details, but a Cook County Grand Jury has been empaneled and is hearing evidence in a Chicago courtroom. No charges have been filed yet.

This class of felony has lower penalties compared to other charges. Those found guilty may face prison time between 1 to 3 three years and face financial penalties up to $25,000.

Lawyers and spokespeople representing the actor were not able to be reached for comment at time of reporting.

Before Smollett's status change in the investigation, the top prosecutor in Chicago recused herself on Tuesday night from any criminal proceedings into the actor’s incident without elaborating on her motivation to step aside on such a high-profile case.

However, as news broke around Smollett's potential felonies, the State’s Attorney Kim Foxx responded to requests for comment by informing The Advocate that her recusal was connected to a meeting with a family member of Smollett earlier in the day. She worried the meeting could impact potential prosecution proceedings.

""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State’s Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,” chief communications officer Tandra Simonton told The Advocate.

“Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State’s Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor,"" she continued.

Earlier this week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service expanded their investigation into hate mail received by Jussie Smollett to include the actor himself. Two federal officials confirmed this most recent change in the investigation scope with ABC News on Tuesday.

The letter first arrived at Fox Studios in Chicago on January 22 before the now well-known reported incident a week later when two men allegedly attacked the actor while yelling homophobic and racist epithets. The letters portrayed a stick-man being shot by a gun with hate language directed at the actor. Substances were found in the envelope but were confirmed to be powdered Tylenol and an unknown protein substance by detectives.

Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, the two men who were picked up and released after giving local police new evidence into the investigation, have told investigators that Smollett paid them to help orchestrate the incident.

They also stated the motive behind the incident was connected to the letters in question not garnering any attention by local or national media once received, according to sources interviewed by ABC News.

During a police raid of the brother's home, a magazine was recovered as evidence by police, according to inventory sheet reviewed by The Advocate.



Police stated last week after the first round of interviews with the two brothers that they produced evidence that changed the ""trajectory"" of the entire investigation. While information from the two men has not been publicly corroberated by Chicago police, it is assumed that it did lead to today's proceedings.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett's attorneys to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender,"" Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

""We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we're hoping he does the same,"" Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

SEE RELATED: Jussie Smollett could face 1 to 3 years in prison for allegedly filing false police report

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account - something police signaled Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" - before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to ""lock in their testimony.""

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that ""it doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Earlier this week, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled by her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

The announcement comes only moments after video surfaced of the two brother purchasing ski masks, gloves, and other supplies in a local store. The Osundairo brothers were allegedly hired by Smollett to act out the attack.

Smollett has adamantly denied accusations that he staged the attack. His family, Fox, and many other celebrity friends also released statements defending him. On Wednesday evening (Feb. 20), Smollett's legal team (Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson) issued the following statement:

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

“Chicago detectives investigating an alleged attack on Jussie Smollett are working to obtain the actor’s financial records, a high-ranking police source said Wednesday,” CNN reported. “Smollett’s attorneys met with Cook County prosecutors earlier Wednesday, according to Chicago Police spokesman Tom Ahern. But a source close to actor’s team told CNN that he has not given police a follow-up interview and no such meeting is scheduled.”

Smollett’s case began on January 22, 2019, when the actor received a threatening letter at the Fox studio where “Empire” is filmed.

Two brothers, who are believed to have orchestrated the attack on Smollett at Smollett’s instruction, claimed that Smollett was also behind sending the threatening letter to himself.

“The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at ‘Empire’s’ Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack,” ABC News reported, after confirming with two federal officials. “The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.”

“Ever just look at someone and think… this mufucca is going to be the reason I go to jail,” Smollett posted to his Instagram account the day after the letter was mailed.

CBS News reported on Monday that Smollett is believed to have orchestrated the attack on himself because he was upset that the letter did not get a “bigger reaction.”

Over the weekend, TMZ reported that Chicago law enforcement officials were suspicious of Smollett’s claims from early on in their investigation:

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

On Wednesday, CBS Chicago released an exclusive video that allegedly showed the two brothers buying supplies they used in the attack. CBS Chicago reported:

The video shows Ola and Abel Osundairo placing the masks and a hat on the counter. Smollett has claimed two men wearing a similar hat and masks attacked him on Jan. 29 in Streeterville, according to police. CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar made multiple phone calls and visited several stores to obtain the video. The Osundairos were arrested last week, but later released without charges. Sources have said the two brothers told police they helped stage the attack with Smollett. They said they were paid $3,500 to pour a chemical on the actor, and place a rope around his neck, while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

The charge may carry a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years and a fine of up to $25,000.

“Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago Police for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer at the Chicago Police Department, told PJ Media. “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

According to Wolfe & Stec, a criminal defense and family law firm, a class 4 felony may land Smollett up to three years in jail and a fine of $25,000.

“Although a Class 4 felony is the least serious of all felony charges, it still is a serious charge, with serious punishments,” the firm explains on its website. “A prison sentence for a Class 4 felony conviction is 1 to 3 years, and Class 4 felony convictions can also include fines of up to $25,000.”

Smollett claims that on January 29, masked white attackers wearing MAGA hats screamed, “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-scented liquid on him. The actor turned over redacted phone records to police, but Guglielmi said those records “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” ABC7 Chicago reported.

Two other pieces of evidence seemed to confirm the idea that the attack was a hoax: a hot sauce bottle with bleach-smelling liquid that emerged after the police sweeps (and may have been planted after the fact), and a record showing the rope in question was purchased by the Osundairo brothers nearby.

On Wednesday morning, CNN reported that Smollett lied to police in Los Angeles, giving a false name in a DUI arrest in 2007.

From the beginning, his story seemed incredible. On the night Smollett claimed to have been attacked, Chicago experienced extremely cold temperatures. The actor also did not remove the noose before going to the hospital.

CNN’s Ryan Young reported that police had spent more than one thousand hours investigating this case. That represents one thousand hours of distraction from the police’s primary job — keeping the peace in Chicago.

Now that Chicago Police officially consider Smollett a suspect, Democrats, Left-wing interest groups, and media figures should expect demands for retractions. Many prominent figures seized on Smollett’s story as evidence of a broad movement of racist and homophobic hatred in America. While horrific attacks do happen, the rush to connect them to Smollett will only delegitimize the groups pushing against such tragedies.

Smollett’s decision to cry wolf will harm real victims, and it also unfairly painted America — and Trump supporters in particular — as hateful. It is extremely important for news of the police investigation against Smollett to spread far and wide.

Facebook has already censored some articles reporting that Smollett’s claims were a hoax. Americans should share stories like this one far and wide, not just because they are true, but because the more Americans share them, the less likely it is that Facebook censorship can silence them.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also said Wednesday that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects in the Jan. 29 attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement earlier Wednesday saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show. The statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn’t find footage of the beating. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men’s apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday, he said the men provided information that had ”shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He also said detectives had requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” She didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation Tuesday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokeswoman.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment. Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said."

Smollet is seen with a cut cheek on Jan. 29

Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while walking home from getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an 'unknown substance' on him.

Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in 'MAGA country,' an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan, which some critics of Trump have claimed is a racist dog whistle.

January 30

Chicago police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack.

Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question.

Reports of Smollett's attack draw outrage and support on social media, including from U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren.

Both Booker and Harris called the incident a 'modern day lynching'.

Joe Biden said: 'We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.'

Later, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two 'persons of interest' are now considered suspects. He says the men are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

Chicago police release two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours.

A police spokesman said the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have 'new evidence' to consider as a result of questioning them.

February 16

A police spokesman said that the investigation had 'shifted' after detectives questioned the two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, Michael Monico, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers said on Saturday the actor felt 'victimized by reports he played a role in the assault, and that Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Jussie Smollett's lawyers say he will fight the felony charge that he filed a false police report claiming two men attacked him last month, as the producers of Empire reportedly consider removing him from the show.

The Chicago Police Department announced on Wednesday night that the Cook County State's Attorney Office had approved criminal charges against 36-year-old Empire star.

His lawyers say he intends to 'mount an aggressive defense' against the class 4 felony, that could land him up to three years in prison if convicted.

Police suspect the actor, who is black and openly gay, staged a racist and homophobic assault against himself on January 29, which he claimed was carried out by white men who shouted 'this is MAGA country' as they put a noose around his neck.

As new of the charges against Smollett broke, Empire's producers were weighing whether to remove him from the Fox drama series, on which he portrays the musician Jamal Lyon, sources close to the show told Variety.

With his once bright career in seeming free-fall, Smollett is now expected to surrender for arrest and booking, police said.

'Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

Smollett is due in bond court on at 1.30pm CT on Thursday.

He was charged with filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony which carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.

In a statement to DailyMail.com, Smollett's attorneys said that he would vigorously contest the charges.

'Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,' attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. 'Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.'

Video footage emerged Wednesday of Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo buying ski masks, a red hat and gloves in a store the day before Smollett reported the attack

Earlier on Wednesday police announced that they were classifying Smollett as a 'suspect in a criminal investigation' and a grand jury was impaneled to hear evidence in the case.

Brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, whom police believe participated in staging the attack, testified before the grand jury for about two and a half hours, their attorney said.

Addressing reporters outside the grand jury, attorney Gloria Schmidt said her clients had been granted no immunity deal, because they had done nothing wrong in the affair.

She said that Smollett was lying, and that she didn't know how his conscience could let him sleep at night.

The brothers' testimony came as video footage emerged of the Nigerian brothers buying ski masks, a red hat and gloves in a store the day before Smollett reported the attack.

The footage was obtained by CBS on Wednesday.

It was taken on January 28 and shows brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo inside what looks like a drug store buying the masks and one hat.

Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked assailants who punched him, poured bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and called him 'Empire n****r f****t'.

No footage has ever emerged of the incident itself.

In the video taken inside the store the day earlier, the brothers look calm in the video as they bring the items to the register.

Abel, whose full name is Abimbola, is dressed in a blue plaid jacket. About 30 seconds into the video, he puts his hood up while standing at the register.

His younger brother Ola, who once appeared on Empire as an extra, is in a green jacket.

Once they had dumped their haul on the register, they looked at one another and waited to be served.

For four-and-a-half minutes, they stand and watch as the cashier bags up their items which included gloves, bobble hats and sunglasses.

Abel put his gloves on to leave the store and he paid cash for everything.

As they waited for the items to be bagged up, Abel got out his phone and appeared to be typing and looking through images.

He and Ola maintained conversation throughout.

The brothers were picked up by police at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday night as they returned from Nigeria.

Abel, who was dressed in a blue plaid jacket, put his hood up 30 seconds into it and then got out his phone. He appeared to type and swipe through photographs

Abel put on his gloves before he left the store. The video was taken a day before the alleged incident

The brothers walked out with two separate bags. The day after the attack, they fled to Nigeria

They flew there on January 29 hours after Smollett reported the attack and a day after they were filmed in the store.

Once in police custody last week, they reportedly told police Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the attack and that he also told them where to buy the rope that was put around his neck.

That was purchased in a separate store, according to police sources.

The video was shared on Wednesday as Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police in Chicago.

Smollett, who claims he did not know his attackers and that it was a racist and homophobic ambush, maintains he was telling the truth.

The brothers, shown in a photo from the Instagram account they use that Smollett follows, told police he paid them to attack him

The brothers said Smollett also sent himself this letter to the Fox studio a week before the attack

Smollett said his attackers were wearing masks but there was not a description of a red hat in the initial reports.

Police have since shared their belief that at least one of them was wearing a red hat at the time of the attack.

Earlier on Wednesday, DailyMail.com learned that Kimberly Foxx, the Cook County State's Attorney in charge of the case, recused herself because she spoke with members of Smollett's family in the immediate aftermath of the attack.

'Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident.

'Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State's Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor,' a spokesman for her office said.

Smollett being named as a suspect on Wednesday after it emerged he once lied to police by pretending to be his younger brother.

In 2007, when he was pulled over for a DUI, Smollett told the officers that he was his younger brother Jake.

Chicago PD released this image in the days after the attack which they now say shows brothers Abel and Ola on the night of the incident. For weeks, they did not know who they were but they honed in on the pair after tracking ride-sharing information from the night and the area

This was the scene after the police had 'searched' the brothers' home last week. Their relatives say they were asked about how the men knew Smollett. Police seized a number of items from their home including bleach - which was allegedly used in the attack - ski masks and a red hat

The brothers' names are included in this inventory list that police left with their relatives detailing all the items they took from the house as part of their investigation. The list included proof of residency for both brothers and bottles of LA's Totally Awesome bleach

Last Thursday, the actor wept as he said 'who the f*** would make that up' when addressing the skepticism surrounding his version of events during an interview on Good Morning America

He then wrote Jake's name on a form.

The actor, who was 25 at the time, pleaded no contest to providing police with false information, driving while intoxicated and driving without a valid license.

He was sentenced to two years probation and had to complete an alcohol awareness and education program.

Smollett's family, many of whom are also actors, have spoken out repeatedly in support of him since the January 29 attack as have many of his co-stars on Empire.

Among them is Gabby Sidibe, his roommate at one time, who said on Instagram on Wednesday: 'I know him. I believe him.'

Fox also insisted that he was not being written out of the show, as had been claimed, and called him a 'consummate professional' in a statement.

Smollett's lawyers include Mark Geragos, who has represented Michael Jackson and Colin Kaepernick, in the past.

Neither Geragos nor his other attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, responded to inquiries on Wednesday about the case.

Smollett being named as a suspect stands to further divide public opinion.

When news of the attack first emerged on January 29 and 30, he was inundated with support across the political spectrum.

Jussie Smollett told police in 2007 that he was his younger brother Jake (shown together) after being pulled over for a DUI

Jussie Smollett's Empire cast mate and close friend Gabby Sidibe (pictured with him on the show) supports him as does the show which said on Wednesday that he was not being written out despite the growing controversy

Among those who tweeted their condemnation of him were Democratic presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

But as days went by with no suspects on the horizon, details about the case and the police's investigation into it began to cast doubt on Smollett's version of events.

One of the earliest sources of speculation was the fact that Smollett waited 42 minutes to call the police then refused to hand over his phone to the police for them to verify his story.

He then handed over redacted files that police described as 'insufficient'.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx has recused herself because she spoke with a member of his family immediately afterwards and 'facilitated a connection' the police

Frustrated with the coverage of his case, he hit out at the media for reporting on leaked information coming from within the Chicago police department and insisted he was the victim.

He then went on Good Morning America to protest his innocence.

In an hour-long interview with Robin Roberts, he wept as he recalled the attack and abhorred the reaction to it.

Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: 'There is a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.'

Later, he added how desperate he was for them to find footage of the attack.

'I want that video found so badly because, for probably four reasons.

'Number one, I want them to find the people that did it.

'Number two, I want them to stop being able to say 'alleged' attack.

'Number three, I want them to see that I fought back,' he continued, welling-up.

'I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the f*** back. They ran off,' I didn't,' he said.

After it emerged that Smollett knew the brothers and may have been involved in the staging of the attack, the celebrities and politicians who rushed to support him walked back their claims.

Nancy Pelosi deleted her tweet about it and Cory Booker said he would now be 'withholding judgement' until more information emerged.

Kamala Harris said, when questioned about her tweet that it was a 'modern day lynching', that she was 'very concerned'."

Smollett fell under investigation when it was discovered that his claim of being attacked by two Trump supporters had been completely made up, possibly in a bid to give himself some public sympathy points to keep himself from being written off his show.

In fact, evidence suggested that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on him, and peg it as an attack carried out by racist, homophobic right-wingers."

Christopher Paul Hasson called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland” and dreamed of ways to “kill almost every last person on earth,” according to court records filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland. Though court documents do not detail a specific planned date for an attack, the government said he had been amassing supplies and weapons since 2017 at the latest, developed a spreadsheet of targets that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and searched the internet using phrases such as “best place in dc to see congress people” and “are supreme court justices protected.”

“The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,” the government said in court documents filed this week, arguing that Hasson should stay in jail awaiting trial.

Hasson, of Silver Spring, is expected to appear before a judge for a detention hearing in federal court in Greenbelt on Thursday.

Hasson was arrested on illegal weapons and drug charges on Friday, but the government says those charges are the “proverbial tip of the iceberg.” Officials with the U.S. attorney’s office in Maryland outlined in court documents Hasson’s alleged plans to spark chaos and destruction, describing a man obsessed with neo-fascist and neo-Nazi views.

“Please send me your violence that I may unleash it onto their heads,” Hasson wrote in a letter that prosecutors say was found in his email drafts. “Guide my hate to make a lasting impression on this world.”

A magistrate judge ordered that the Office of the Federal Public Defender represent Hasson; the office declined comment Wednesday.

Hasson has been working at the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters in Washington since 2016, according to court documents filed by prosecutors. He also served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1988 to 1993 and in the Army National Guard for about two years in the mid-90s.

Agents with the FBI field office in Baltimore and the Coast Guard Investigative Service arrested Hasson on Friday, FBI Baltimore spokesman Dave Fitz confirmed.

Court documents do not detail what prompted federal law enforcement to begin investigating Hasson, but they say Hasson has been studying the 1,500-page manifesto of right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who unleashed two attacks in 2011 that killed 77 in Norway. They say Hasson’s attack preparations resembled Breivik’s.

The manifesto outlined how Breivik planned and prepared his attacks with the aim of providing an outline for others planning similar terrorist operations, the U.S. court filings say.

Breivik took steroids and narcotics, believing it would heighten his abilities to carry out attacks. When law enforcement raided Hasson’s apartment, they said they found a locked container loaded with more than 30 vials of what appeared to be human growth hormones. He has also ordered more than 4,200 pills of the narcotic Tramadol since 2016, along with synthetic urine to allegedly bypass possible random drug screenings at work.

Breivik encouraged identifying targets and traitors. In recent weeks, Hasson developed a spreadsheet of targets that included top Democratic congressional leaders and media personalities. The list includes “JOEY,” what prosecutors say is a reference to former Rep. Joe Scarborough who works for MSNBC; “cortez,” an alleged reference to freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York; and “Sen blumen jew” presumably Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

Authorities seized 15 firearms, including several long guns and rifles, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from his basement apartment after executing a search warrant this month. Over the past two years, he had made nearly two dozen purchases of firearms or related equipment and made thousands of visits to websites that sell weapons or tactical gear.

Authorities said Hasson harbored extremist views for years.

“The defendant is a domestic terrorist,” the government said in court filings, “bent, on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.”

In an email he drafted in June 2017, he contemplated biological attacks and targeting food supplies. He considered the merits of a “bombing/sniper campaign” and included a “Things to do” list that included purchasing land “out west or possibly NC mtns” for family and researching tactics used during the civil war in Ukraine.

“During unrest target both sides to increase tension,” Hasson wrote in the email, according to the court filings. “In other words provoke gov/police to over react which should help to escalate violence. BLM protests or other left crap would be ideal to incite to violence.”

In another letter drafted months later to an American neo-Nazi leader, Hasson called for a “white homeland.” He sent the letter to himself nearly two months after the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where torch-carrying white-supremacists clashed with anti-racist protesters.

“I never saw a reason for mass protest or wearing uniforms marching around provoking people with swastikas etc.,” Hasson said. “I was and am a man of action you cannot change minds protesting like that. However you can make change with a little focused violence.”

Hasson’s commitment to destruction appeared to increase in recent weeks, according to details from prosecutors. He created a list of “traitors” and targets on Jan. 19 in a spreadsheet on his work computer. The spreadsheet was created two days after he conducted a series of internet inquiries:

8:54 a.m.: “what if trump illegally impeached”

8:57 a.m.: “best place in dc to see congress people”

8:58 a.m.: “where in dc to congress live”

10:39 a.m.: “civil war if trump impeached”

11:26 a.m.: “social democrats usa”

Does he really want to trade the most gifted young scorer this organization has produced since Paul Pierce? Or is Tatum essential as a complement to whoever lands here next summer, be it Davis or, considering that the Celtics were on his free agency short list once before, Kevin Durant?

Ainge doesn’t need further proof of Tatum’s value, but received a strong reminder this past weekend when the second-year forward was the toast of the first two nights of All-Star weekend. He scored 30 points for the winning U.S. team during the Rising Stars Challenge, and with a 30-foot pull-up calculated to beat the quick release of Trae Young a good seven feet closer to the basket, won Saturday night’s Skills Challenge.

Last spring’s playoff performance was not a fluke. Outside of Kyrie Irving, Tatum is already the Celtic most likely to free up and make a shot when the team absolutely needs one. In the NBA, this remains the single rarest skill to have, and certainly the most difficult to trade for.

Though he hasn’t been around long enough to be jaded by the business of the NBA – Tatum said over the weekend that he wants to remain a Celtic – he was forced to sweat his way through a storm’s worth of trade rumors with his name attached just before this month’s trade deadline.

When Ainge said during a radio interview that there was one player in particular who required some hand holding during that period, it was widely thought to be Tatum.

On the record this weekend, Tatum denied the concern.

“It didn’t really bother me. I wasn’t fazed by it,” he said. “A lot of it was rumors, I didn’t know if it was true or not. My job was just to play basketball. I wasn’t fazed by anything I saw on TV.”

At risk for the Celtics is what Tatum would almost certainly become somewhere else, perhaps as the next young star in New Orleans – a franchise with a growing list of young stars who became frustrated with the team’s inability to build.

But for Detroit Coach Dwane Casey, there’s no doubt about where Tatum is headed.

“The most important thing for him is the maturity level,” said Casey. “He’s a great talent, one of the great young talents in our league, doesn’t get the proper amount of respect because (the Celtics) have so many good players on their team. But he has a skill set that really is the future of the NBA – inside, outside, athletic ability.

“The only thing he has to fight is time, being patient with himself,” he said. “Fans being patient. There’s not a lot of that in our league. But that supportive thing is going to be the key to making him one of the leaders in our game.”

Tatum’s presence on a talent-laden team is double-edged. He benefits from the influence of older stars. But if not for these veterans, he would have more opportunities to shine.

“Very difficult when you have so many guys at the same level coming through at the same time,” said Casey. “Now he has a great older guy in Kyrie, but one of the most difficult things a younger guy can go through – DeMar DeRozan was there, Rashard Lewis in Seattle, watching those guys grow, staying patient, today’s technology doesn’t help because everyone wants to be the next Michael (Jordan), the next Kobe (Bryant), and it doesn’t happen that quick. It takes time.”

Casey was the coach most responsible for DeRozan’s development in Toronto, and he expects similar growth from Tatum. His advice to Tatum would be simple.

Jussie Smollett has allegedly agreed to speak to cops one more time.

TMZ reports that brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were ready to testify for the grand jury, however, Smollett’s legal team called prosecutors to tell them that the actor was ready to cooperate with police.

The brothers’ testimonies have now been postponed, this means that Jussie may not face charges for filing a false report.

As of Wednesday, the grand jury did not meet as expected. It is not clear when Jussie is scheduled to meet with the police department or what new information he has to offer.

As we reported, the star claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack. However, in the weeks since the attack numerous details have surfaced that contradict Jussie’s story claiming that it was staged. Footage has also emerged showing the brother’s purchasing ski masks and MAGA hats prior to the attack.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also said Wednesday that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects in the Jan. 29 attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It's unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn't reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement earlier Wednesday saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character isn't being written off the show. The statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn't find footage of the beating. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men's apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday, he said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He also said detectives had requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" She didn't respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation Tuesday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokeswoman.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn't elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment. Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said."

New video shows the two men who say Jussie Smollett hired them to stage the alleged hate crime attack buying a bunch of items they used during the incident.

The newly released surveillance footage, obtained by CBS2 in Chicago, shows what appears to be Ola and Abel Osundairo at the checkout counter ringing up ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats.

Police said Smollett claimed two men wearing a similar hat and masks attacked him on January 29th in Chicago. The Osundairo brothers were arrested last Wednesday, but were released without charges Friday.

Sources have said the two brothers, who are actors and appeared as extras on Empire, told investigators they helped stage the attack with Smollett. They said the Empire actor paid them $3,500 to assault him, pour bleach on him, and place a rope around his neck, all while yelling racist and homophobic slurs.

Sources said at least one of the brothers purchased the rope used in the incident, which was Smollett’s idea. The sources also said Smollett paid for the rope, which was bought at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of January 25th, just a few days before the attack.

One of the brothers is said to have held the rope and poured the bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled the slurs at Smollett, sources said. The brothers reportedly told detectives that the attack was supposed to happen before January 29th and they, along with Smollett, rehearsed the attack days before it happened.

Smollett vehemently denies staging the incident, however.

Meanwhile, 21th Century Fox has repeatedly denied rumors that Smollett was being written off Empire.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” a Fox spokesperson stated.

According to TMZ, the brothers attended a court hearing Tuesday and were ready to testify for the grand jury, but they were called off at the last minute because Jussie’s attorneys plan to speak to police."

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

One of the two men appeared as an extra on “Empire.” After the men were released from police custody without criminal charges on Friday, Chicago Police announced today that Smollett is a suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a false police report.

It was originally reported that Smollett’s alleged attackers called him homophobic and racist slurs, put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him, and yelled “this is MAGA country” before leaving the scene. Smollett received widespread public support following the incident. Earlier today, CBS Chicago shared video footage that showed the Osundairos purchasing ski masks, red hats, and other items days before the alleged attack.

Following the alleged attack, Smollett’s family released a statement, calling the incident an “inhumane act of domestic terrorism.” Smollett released his own statement earlier this month claiming: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers, and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

On February 14, Smollett discussed the reported attack on “Good Morning America,” stating, “I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”

See original story below.

Jussie Smollett has been named as a suspect in a criminal investigation, Chicago Police confirmed Wednesday. The 36-year-old actor is being investigated for filing a false police report in late January, when he told authorities he had been attacked by two masked men in Chicago. The department's spokesman Anthony Guglielmi announced detectives are now presenting evidence to a Cook County Grand Jury.

Smollett could face up to three years in prison if convicted of the class 4 felony.

Smollett told police the alleged assault occurred outside at around 2 a.m. outside a sandwich shop. The Empire star claimed the culprits poured a substance on him, tied a rope around his neck, and yelled racial, homophobic slurs. He also said one of the men referenced Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan before fleeing the scene.

In the weeks following Smollett's report, details emerged that raised suspicion about the actor's claims. Two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were arrested last week in connection with the assault, but were released without any charges.

Shortly before the Chicago Police's announcement, CBS 2 shared a video in which Ola and Abel Osundairo were seen purchasing items allegedly used in the Smollett attack. The brothers, who worked with Smollett on Empire, reportedly told authorities the actor paid them $3,500 to help stage the attack before they traveled to Africa. The video shows Ola and Abel Osundairo buying a red hat and skimasks—items Smollett claims the perpetrators were wearing during the assault.

Smollett's attorneys denied their client was complicit in the alleged assault: ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" his lawyers said Saturday. ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

CNN reports investigators are also trying to obtained Smollett's financial records."

Jussie Smollett has officially been named a suspect in the criminal investigation into his attack, Chicago police have announced, and he was charged this evening with filing a false police report. The crime carries a felony charge, and if Smollett is found guilty he could face up to three years in prison. Shortly before the indictment was handed down, the lawyer for the brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo said her clients testified for more than two hours before a grand jury, and that they have received “no immunity and no plea deal,” because they have done nothing wrong. Anthony Guglielmi, the head of communications for the Chicago Police Department, said on Twitter that, “Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

The Empire actor had previously claimed that two men violently attacked him outside a Subway in Chicago in what he described as a racist and homophobic hate crime in late January. Smollett alleged that the two masked men tied a noose around his neck, beat him, poured bleach on him, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him, yelling, “This is MAGA country!” Subsequent evidence, however, led investigators to “shift the trajectory” of the case and consider Smollett an “active participant” in his own attack, which Smollett’s attorneys have repeatedly denied.

The Osundairo brothers were eventually arrested and brought in for questioning in the attack. One of them previously appeared on Empire and the other worked as Smollett’s personal trainer. According to both men and further reports, Smollett “orchestrated” the attack, paid the brothers upwards of $3,500 to carry it out, and paid for the items used in the attack. The brothers reportedly said all three men “rehearsed” the attack days prior to it happening; the Osundairo brothers were eventually released by police without being charged. CBS reported that Smollett allegedly plotted the attack after being upset that a threatening letter containing a white powder that he received a week prior to the attack did not elicit a more serious response from 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Empire. A magazine potentially used to create the letter was seized from the brothers’ home; that letter is currently being investigated by the FBI.

On Tuesday, the Osundairo brothers were prepared to testify before a grand jury, but a last-minute call from Smollett’s lawyers reportedly postponed their testimony. Police have sought to reinterview him in the wake of new evidence. Earlier Wednesday, CBS published security-camera footage that appears to show the Osundairo brothers purchasing a red hat and ski masks days before the attack. On Wednesday, Fox also released a new statement standing by Smollett, maintaining that he isn’t being written off the show. 20th Century Fox has now declined to comment on the news of Smollett being named a suspect.

Update 2/20 9:32 PM: Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, have issued a statement regarding their client’s defense. “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” they told Deadline. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

Update 2/20 11:04 PM: Variety is now reporting that Fox may remove Smollett from production on Empire, though producers for the series declined to comment.

Johnson shared, “I just wish the families of gun violence got this much attention. I know the racial divide, how hard it’s been for our city and nation to come together.”

“[Smollett] took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. Why would anyone use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How can an individual turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”

He continued, “I’m offended by what’s happened and I’m also angry. This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and didn’t deserve.”

“I only hope the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did.”

Johnson then said in response to a question from reporters, “Absolute justice would be an apology to this city, admitting what he did.”

The conference came after it was reported that Smollett, who turned himself in at 5.15 a.m. local time, had been arrested and was now in police custody. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed the news on Twitter Thursday morning.

After days of speculation, Guglielmi confirmed the 36-year-old “Empire” star “was now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report.”

As Guglielmi stated in the above tweet, filing a false report is a class 4 felony, which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

In late January, Smollett told police he was attacked by two men who beat him up while hurling racist and homophobic insults at him, tying a noose around his neck and attempting to pour a chemical substance on him.

Police subsequently interviewed two suspects, both of whom were known to Smollett, who reportedly alleged the actor paid them $3,500 to stage the attack.

Meanwhile, CBS’s Chicago affiliate had obtained video surveillance footage of the suspects — brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo — at a convenience store purchasing ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats. Watch:

Hours after deeming Smollett a suspect, Guglielmi confirmed that the actor has been charged with federal disorderly conduct/filing a false police report by the Cook County state’s attorney.

According to Guglielmi at the time, “Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson subsequently issued a statement to ET: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.

UPDATE: Empire star Jussie Smollett has officially been charged with a felony for filing a false police report.

Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement, “Felony criminal charges have been approved by Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

In their own statement to EW, Smollett’s lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson declared, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

Meanwhile, Fox had no comment when reached by EW.

EARLIER: Jussie Smollett is officially a suspect in the criminal investigation into the alleged attack against him.

On Wednesday afternoon, Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi tweeted this update: “Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony). Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

Just over three weeks ago, the Empire star appeared to be the victim of a racial and homophobic attack in Chicago, where the Fox series films. But the narrative turned Saturday, when the Chicago PD confirmed that new evidence had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” New reports have said that the two original suspects, who have ties to Smollett through Empire, were prepared to testify Tuesday in front of a grand jury that they were hired by the actor to stage the attack, before a call from Smollett’s lawyers postponed the proceedings. But according to the latest statement, that grand jury is currently convened.

Last Thursday in a tear-filled interview on Good Morning America, Smollett emphatically dismissed the idea that he could have embellished or made this story up, even declaring, “Who the f— would make something like this up?”

This new development in the case comes hours after Fox continued to stand by the Empire actor, insisting he isn’t being written off of the hit series. After the update from Chicago police, Fox and 20th Century Fox Television had no comment when reached by EW.

4:30 p.m.

A police official says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect “for filing a false police report” and that detectives are presenting the case against him to a grand jury.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn’t find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had “shifted” the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

3:10 p.m.

A police official says lawyers for Jussie Smollett are meeting with prosecutors and police investigators about the reported attack on the “Empire” actor late last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the meeting was taking place Wednesday afternoon. He declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for Smollett’s phone and bank records.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

11:45 a.m.

Fox Television says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and it has reiterated that he’s not being written out of the show.

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor’s report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had “shifted” after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

___

6:40 a.m.

Chicago police say they’ve dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday that a person in the building reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. But he says video evidence shows the report isn’t credible.

Guglielmi says the two brothers meet with investigators Tuesday. There was no immediate word on what they discussed.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

On Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offence that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett's attorneys to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender,"" Guglielmi said. That could involve Smollett turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

He said he did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

""We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we're hoping he does the same,"" Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account -- something police signalled Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" -- an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" -- before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully co-operated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to ""lock in their testimony.""

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record -- one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Also Wednesday, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

It worked.

Top-seeded Oxford Hills held on, beating No. 4 Portland 47-36 at Cross Insurance Arena to advance to the regional final against No. 7 Deering at 2 p.m. Friday.

Before the final quarter, the Vikings endured a strong comeback bid led by Gemima Motema, who scored 11 points in the second and third quarters and recorded two blocks and two steals to get the Bulldogs within five points.

Julia Colby then scored four of her 12 points in the fourth quarter to help Oxford Hills reach its fifth regional final in six years.

Colby and Cassidy Dumont each made two free throws to ice the win.

“They went on a little run, they were packing it in, blocked a couple shots, so we had to make a decision,” said Oxford Hills Coach Nate Pelletier, “and I think if we stretch them out and played a little offense that way, they’d have to foul us. I wish we made a few more foul shots down the stretch, but Julia is shooting 80 percent from the line, so she’ll take the ball any day, and Cassidy shot the ball well, too.”

In the first quarter, Colby and Bailey Whitney scored six points each to help the Vikings go on a 10-1 run that resulted in a 17-10 lead after eight minutes.

The Vikings opened up the second quarter with an 8-2 run to stretch the lead to 25-12. The main contributor in that spurt was junior Cecilia Dieterich, who scored her first bucket off a great cut down the lane for a layup, then scored quickly again off a steal and outlet pass from Dumont.

Dieterich scored seven points in the second quarter, and Oxford Hills went into halftime with a 30-20 lead.

Portland was paced by the aggressive scoring of Motema, who finished the first half with six points, three rebounds and a steal.

Motema missed the first nine games of the season because of an injury.

“When I think of Gemima, I think of her starting the second half of her season,” Portland Coach Gerry Corcoran said. “With her injuries and being out the first nine games of the season, right now she’s coming into where she should have been maybe two or three games in.”

Motema continued her hot streak in the third quarter with seven points, two blocks and a steal. The sophomore guard was everywhere, trying to drag her team back into the contest.

To counter her scoring, Pelletier spread out his team’s offense and switched the defense to try to force some turnovers.

“We went to some zone, we ran a 1-3-1 zone at one point, so it wasn’t just a one-on-one trying to match up with her because it’s impossible to match up with her one-on-one,” Pelletier said. “When we went to the zone, it helped everybody out to say, ‘Hey, we are protecting the paint.'”

Portland got back within five in the fourth quarter, thanks to a free throw and a layup by Davina Kabantu.

Colby’s layup added a few more points to the Vikings’ lead. But they then turned the ball over under the hoop, giving Portland some life.

That’s when Oxford Hills began to dribble the ball around to take as much time off the clock as it could. Portland had to resort to fouling, presumably earlier than it had hoped, and the Vikings’ clutch shooting paved the way to a win.

“When we play well, we play well,” Corcoran said. “When we struggle, we struggle. To the girls’ credit, it was a totally different game from last year. We fought back twice to get it to five, and if we just capitalize on a couple different plays. … But they have tremendous guards.”

In a news release posted Wednesday on the department’s Facebook page, Portsmouth police identified the driver as 20-year-old Karl Patzke II of Birch Hill Road in York.

Patzke was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment of injuries he sustained after being ejected from his truck, but after being released was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated (a Class B felony) and driving while intoxicated (a Class B misdemeanor). He was also summonsed for a stop sign violation.

According to police, Patzke’s 2008 Ford F250 pickup truck failed to stop for a stop sign near a Wendy’s restaurant in the vicinity of 1465 Woodbury Avenue around 6:45 p.m. His truck collided with a Honda Accord, causing his truck to roll over several times.

Two passengers in the truck were not seriously hurt and the 65-year-old driver of the car did not suffer life threatening injuries.

Patzke was bailed from the hospital and will be arraigned at a later date in Rockingham County Superior Court.

Portsmouth police say their investigation into the crash remains active. Anyone with information, should contact Officer Matt Young at 603-610-7619.

The bill before the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee would need the support of two-thirds of the House and Senate and then ratification by a statewide vote before it became law. Supporters of the bill, including its sponsor, Sen. Jeff Timberlake, R-Turner, say it is needed to stop well-heeled, out-of-state special interest groups from using Maine’s referendum process to increase taxes with ballot questions that voters don’t understand.

But opponents, including committee members, said the change is unneeded and may do more harm than good.

The bill is largely a response to a successful 2016 ballot box measure to tack a 3 percent surcharge on all household income over $200,000 as a way to increase public school funding. Although the referendum was approved by voters, the Legislature subsequently repealed the new law and erased the surcharge.

Timberlake said groups backing or opposing ballot measures in Maine spent some $81 million in the last eight years, with 71 percent of that money flowing into Maine from out of state.

“Tax policy is complex and difficult to understand,” Timberlake said. “It certainly can’t be boiled down to one-sentence, yes or no questions on a ballot. Beyond that it is a dangerous thing for the many to have the power to tax a few.” He said the best place to craft tax policy was at the Legislature and not through a “30-second sound bite and flashy commercials.”

But several members of the committee pushed back, saying that voters knew what they were doing and have both approved and rejected tax increases at the ballot box in recent years.

State Rep. Kent Ackley, an independent from Monmouth, challenged Timberlake’s reasoning. He agreed that a lot of out-of-state money was pouring into Maine politics.

Related Final count shows Maine voters passed new tax for school funding

But Ackley said much of that money was spent on individual candidates’ campaigns by outside groups, or in the form of paid lobbying at the State House. He asked Timberlake whether he wanted to do something about that.

Ackley also challenged the notion that voters couldn’t figure out ballot questions or that complicated policy changes were too hard for many to understand. He noted that voters rejected a ballot measure last fall that would have raised taxes on high wage earners to fund a universal home care program for the elderly and disabled. He said voters also rejected requiring universal background checks for all gun sales, as well as a ban on allowing hunters to use bait and traps to kill bears.

“I would be much more comfortable with having the citizens of Maine discern what is truth and what is not in a citizens initiative process then have folks make a decision here in the committee rooms of Augusta,” Ackley said.

Linda Caprara, representing the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, backed Timberlake, saying changes to tax policy can have far-reaching implications, especially for businesses, that are not always spelled out clearly for voters. “Any time complicated tax policy is decided at the ballot box it risks unintended consequences,” Caprara said.

But again Ackley pushed back, saying, “I knock on thousands of doors every two years and it strikes me that if people don’t understand something they are asked to vote on they just don’t vote.”

A work session on the bill, where lawmakers will take a vote to recommend whether it should be approved by the full Legislature, has not yet been scheduled.

The committee also heard another proposal that would prohibit paying petitioners for each voter signature they gather. Sen. Stacey Guerin, R-Glenburn, the sponsor of the bill, said the measure does not prohibit organizations from paying people to collect signatures by the hour or by the day – only by the signature.

“The regular people of our state realize there is a serious credibility problem in the pay-per-signature practice, and we must address this serious issue in order to restore confidence and faith in the process,” Guerin said.

Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn said courts in Maine other states have ruled against prohibitions on per-signature payments. Other lawmakers suggested the state might try to limit the amount paid per signature to as low as 1 cent per signature, but Flynn said the courts would probably not look at that favorably either.

“Something that low would be seen as banning it,” she said.

The proposal will also go to a work session for committee deliberations.

By Michelle Malkin

Is it any wonder that American news consumers are at the end of their ropes of patience with the “mainstream media”?

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed.

Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

Columbia University, 2007 . Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism — until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

University of Delaware, 2015 . Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The UD president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators.

A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election.

The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn’t take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose: When you’ve seen one social justice huckster, you’ve seen ’em all.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Police were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to ‘‘negotiate a reasonable surrender,’’ Guglielmi said. That could involve Smollett turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

He said he did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

‘‘We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,’’ Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.

The announcement of the charges came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a ‘‘significant shift in the trajectory’’ of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ‘‘This is MAGA country’’ — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, ‘‘Make America Great Again’’ — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ‘‘continues to be a consummate professional on set’’ and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ‘‘Abel’’ and Olabinjo ‘‘Ola’’ Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released.

The next day, police said the men provided information that had ‘‘shifted the trajectory of the investigation,’’ and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ‘‘Empire,’’ and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ‘‘Sum of My Music,’’ last year.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

‘‘There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,’’ Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ‘‘You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,’’ she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport. For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, ‘‘I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.’’

Also Wednesday, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ‘‘out of an abundance of caution’’ because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ‘‘facilitated a connection’’ between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

Smollett's case has taken many strange turns since it broke in late January. In the last week, new evidence has come to suggest that he orchestrated his own assault in Chicago, making it look like a hate crime. On Wednesday evening, Chicago P.D. spokesman Anthony Guglielmi announced that Smollett was officially a suspect.

""Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by [Chicago Police] for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),"" he tweeted. ""Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.""

The case has been a strange one from the start. Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men in what Sen. Kamala Harris called ""an attempted modern day lynching."" However, when police finally arrested two persons of interest in the case, they were African-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo.

One of the brothers had worked with Smollett on the set of Empire as an extra, and it was from their interviews with police that authorities began to suspect Smollett had planned his ""attack."" Security footage appeared to show them with Smollett in the elevator of his apartment building shortly before the scuffle, and police suspect Smollett paid them $3,500 for the hoax.

According to a report by The Blast, the Osundairo brothers were very close to testifying in front of the grand jury themselves on Wednesday, however Smollett's attorney was able to call and postpone their testimony. Smollett himself continues to claim he is an innocent victim in the whole affair, and has brought on criminal defense attorneys including Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson to help clear his name.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" they said in a statement to Deadline last week. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett has not given additional interviews with police. The Grand Jury will decide whether or not to indict the actor."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi also tweeted Wednesday that detectives and two brothers who were initially deemed suspects in the Jan. 29 attack were testifying before a grand jury.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay and plays the Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show, said he was attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. He said they beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before looping a rope around his neck and fleeing.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement Wednesday saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show. The statement follows reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation into the reported attack.

Investigators went through hundreds of hours of private and public surveillance video from the area where Smollett said he was attacked but couldn’t find footage of the beating. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the men’s apartment.

The men, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives, but on Saturday, he said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He also said detectives had requested another interviewwith Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Pugh and Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” She didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation Tuesday, according to a one-sentence statement issued by a spokeswoman.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. She didn’t elaborate as to how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case and she said Foxx would have no further comment. Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, will oversee the case, the office said."

CHICAGO -- The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

6:55 p.m.

Chicago police say 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State's Attorney's office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

___

6:45 p.m.

An attorney representing two brothers implicated in the alleged scheme by 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett to file a false police report in what he's said was an attack by masked men in Chicago last month says the two testified before a grand jury for a total of 2 Â½ hours and that they did take money from Smollett.

Gloria Schmidt told reporters at the Chicago courthouse after Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo appeared before the grand jury on Wednesday that the two did not testify as part of any plea deal with prosecutors and said that the two were not granted any immunity from prosecution.

She said there was a point where the account of the men needed to be told and that they ""manned up and said, 'We're gonna correct this.'""

The testimony came after the brothers were released from custody by police who said they were no longer suspects. Their testimony came the same day that police department said that Smollett is now considered a suspect for ""filing a false police report"" and that the case has been referred to a grand jury

___

4:55 p.m.

A spokeswoman says Chicago's top prosecutor recused herself from the Jussie Smollett investigation because she had had conversations with one of the ""Empire"" actor's family members and ""facilitated a connection"" with the police department.

Tandra Simonton said Wednesday that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case last week ""out of an abundance of caution."" The move was announced Tuesday.

Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

A police official says Smollett is suspected of lying about the attack and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday afternoon.

Smollett has repeated stood by his account. The black and gay actor told police that two masked men attacked him early on Jan. 29 and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett's lawyers didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.

___

4:30 p.m.

A police official says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect ""for filing a false police report"" and that detectives are presenting the case against him to a grand jury.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn't find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had ""shifted"" the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

___

3:10 p.m.

A police official says lawyers for Jussie Smollett are meeting with prosecutors and police investigators about the reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor late last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the meeting was taking place Wednesday afternoon. He declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for Smollett's phone and bank records.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

11:45 a.m.

Fox Television says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and it has reiterated that he's not being written out of the show.

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett's role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor's report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had ""shifted"" after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

___

6:40 a.m.

Chicago police say they've dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday that a person in the building reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. But he says video evidence shows the report isn't credible.

Guglielmi says the two brothers meet with investigators Tuesday. There was no immediate word on what they discussed.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

On Saturday, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett reported Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” After releasing two former suspects over the weekend, police said they wanted to interview Smollett again — and then declared him the suspect.

“Case Update: Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by # ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Wednesday. “Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

20th Century Fox, which produces “Empire,” declined to comment. Earlier on Wednesday, before police declared Smollett a suspect, Fox renewed its past support of Smollett, saying, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

Since Smollett’s first police report on Jan. 29, the investigation took many turns, with varying degrees of cooperation from Smollett. At one point, police brought in brothers Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo as persons of interest. As it turned out, both had worked on “Empire.”

The brothers were released without charges last Friday after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course. Earlier this week, CNN reported that Chicago police believed that Smollett might have paid the brothers to stage the attack.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, Fox received a letter threatening Smollett. On Tuesday, ABC News reported that the FBI and U.S. Postal Service were looking into the possibility that Smollett had sent the threatening letter to himself, or played a role in its creation and delivery.

Also on Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the investigation to avoid “potential questions of impartiality,” a rep for Foxx said. First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats has been set to act as prosecutor in her place."

Smollett was the alleged victim of an attack in Chicago last month, in which two men supposedly approached the actor/singer and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. According to the original account, the two men beat Smollett, poured a chemical substance (believed to be bleach) on him and tied a noose around his neck before fleeing the scene. Smollett also told police that the assailants “yelled pro-‘Make America Great Again’ [MAGA] comments” during the attack.

Later developments cast doubt on Smollett’s account, including the questioning of two suspects — a pair of Nigerian brothers, one of whom worked as a personal trainer on a music video of Smollett’s — who were later released without being charged. Smollett’s lawyers have insisted that the actor played no role in his attack, and 20th Century Fox, the producers of Empire, have stood behind him, denying reports that his role on the show was being reduced after the controversy: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set, and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”"

Suddenly the left is all about baby steps and not rushing to judgment.

When actor Jussie Smollett – who is gay and black – claimed he was targeted in a very late-night attack on a cold Chicago street last month because of his race and sexual orientation, the deed was decried far and wide. Adding to the controversy was Smollett’s claim that the attackers wore Trump campaign hats and called the Windy City “MAGA country.”

The reaction to this alleged “hate crime” was quick and certain.

Senator Kamala Harris immediately called it “a modern-day lynching.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that it was a “racist, homophobic attack.” Lee Daniels, the creator of the television show “Empire” on which Smollett stars, said it was “just another f—king day in America.”

But, as Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper pointed out on a recent edition of “The Ingraham Angle” on the Fox News Channel:

This story is not adding up in any way – where it occurred, when it occurred. None of that makes sense… But what’s most important here is how fast the media decided that this needed to be national news.

Commenting on Smollett’s increasingly cagey behavior and unwillingness to work with the police, Horace added:

And at least you would think that, if we’re gonna give it that kind of credence and that kind of attention – the minimum could be that the alleged victim could present the information that would help the investigation go forward.

Now, as Smollett’s case is falling apart, and it appears he may have actually staged the attack all the way down to having his collaborators purchase red hats, there is reservation and obfuscation among those who used it as proof of our nation’s failings just days ago.

Pelosi, for example, deleted her tweet. Harris later cautioned: “I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.” And there are reports that Smollett’s role in “Empire” is being reduced.

Another liberal pumping the brakes on Smollett speculation was attorney Leo Terrell, who debated Horace on the Ingraham show. In fact, Terrell claimed it was Horace who was rushing – a charge Horace quickly and effectively refuted:

Terrell: Horace already rushed to judgment on whether or not Smollett’s story is true. Horace: No, I haven’t… I said this doesn’t add up. There are too many irregularities. Terrell: How do you know that? Horace: Because I can use reason and logic. For one thing, the location where this occurred. How much time it took for the call [to police] to take place. My point is… I’m fine with an investigation taking place. What I’m not fine with is the media making this a big enough story that we have to get minute-by-minute coverage.

Explaining the proper process and spotlighting the questionable behavior, Horace added:

You let an investigation take place, and then you reach conclusions. This investigation is still ongoing, and there are some troubling aspects about it that need to be further developed. Why won’t [Smollett] give the [phone] records so we can see who he was calling and hear it simultaneously?

With the facts of the alleged attack now in serious dispute, many liberals who wanted to believe Smollett’s account are now pivoting to suggesting any fabrication is based on real racism in general. Guest host Raymond Arroyo highlighted an essay in GQ magazine in which Joshua Rivera wrote about the situation: “While the veracity isn’t confirmed, its sentiment needs no fact-check.”

Terrell agreed, saying, “It’s clear… the… last two years under the Trump Administration, this country has been divided based on race, gender, sex, sexual orientation – so, it’s not surprising people have done this.”

Citing that the facts are more positive than Terrell would lead people to believe, Horace replied: “If – by division by race, gender and sex – you mean women have earned more, blacks have earned more, Latinos have done better, yes, I guess we are. Because they have done so faster than the rest of the country.”

On the issue of intolerance, Horace also noted how Alec Baldwin has not earned the media spotlight for a recent physical altercation in which the liberal actor allegedly also used homophobic slurs (and this is not the first such allegation against him):"

The felony charge, which in Illinois falls under disorderly conduct, was approved by the Cook County State’s Attorney's Office hours after the actor was officially classified by Chicago police as a suspect in the case.

Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said detectives will now negotiate with the actor’s legal team to set terms for ""a reasonable surrender"" for his arrest.

The decision to charge comes weeks after the Empire actor told Chicago police he was attacked early Jan. 29 by two men who threw a bleachlike chemical on him, called him anti-gay slurs, and put a rope around his neck. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett also said one of the attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, has maintained that he was the victim of a hate crime, and the reported attack quickly received national attention, putting immediate pressure on Chicago police to solve the case.

With little initial evidence of the attack located, police released grainy images of two persons of interest who were captured on surveillance video in Smollett's neighborhood around the time the actor said he was attacked."

4:39 PM PT — The Cook County state’s attorney’s office has just charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for Ola and Abel Osundairo, said her clients testified in front of a grand jury for 2.5 hours on Wednesday.

A bond court hearing has been set for Thursday at 1:30 PM.

Jussie Smollett has now been deemed a suspect for his participation in the alleged attack that now appears to have been a hoax for publicity.

Anthony Guglielmi, a rep for the Chicago Police Department, announced on Wednesday, ""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony).""

He continued, ""Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.""

Ola and Abel Osundairo were minutes from testifying before the grand jury on Wednesday, but a Hail Mary call from Smollett's attorneys caused prosecutors to hold off.

CBS reporter Charlie De Mar just obtained the video of the Osundairo brothers placing gloves, ski masks and red hats on the counter of the Chicago beauty store.

The brothers reportedly told police Smollett paid them $3,500 to purchase the supplies and take part in a staged attack. The Osundairos also allegedly purchased a rope from a nearby hardware store a few days earlier.

Those items were later seized by police during a raid on the brothers' home, along with a script for ""Empire.""

As we reported, FOX and ""Empire"" are sticking by Smollett in the wake of the controversy, claiming his character on the hit show is not in jeopardy, and that there are no plans to write him out of the series.

Smollett has proclaimed his innocence in the matter but has since brought aboard criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos to help navigate the legal waters."

Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — While Chicago police officials confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that authorities are maintaining a dialogue with Jussie Smollett’s attorneys, they remain anxious to re-interview the actor himself.

“We are hopeful that we’ll have a chance to ask the questions that we have,” says Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

“It doesn’t matter what the investigation shows,” Guglielmi said. “If you have information that’s helpful to law enforcement, it behooves you to contact authorities and share that information. We have been very diplomatic and have been working with him and his attorneys. We got information, and that’s what we want to run by him.”

If Smollett does not come in to speak with police, he said, “We’re going to go with other methods to create a culture of accountability.”

Later Wednesday, an official briefed on the Smollett investigation confirmed to ABC News that attorneys representing Smollett met with police and prosecutors in Chicago today. Lawyers and police would not immediately detail the substance of the discussion.

The CPD’s latest public stance comes after two federal officials confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed, prior to the alleged Jan. 29 attack.

The letter, which was sent Jan. 22, is currently in an FBI crime lab for analysis, one of the sources said.

The allegation concerning the alleged attack and the letter — made by brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who are cooperating with investigators in the probe — has not been officially confirmed.

The Osundairo brothers have also told investigators that Smollett paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the Jan. 29 attack that Smollett said occurred near his Chicago apartment, sources said. Police have not independently verified these allegations and no one has been charged in connection with the case.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett told police that on Jan. 29, he was walking on a street near his apartment around 2 a.m. when he was set upon by two men.

Actor Jussie Smollett has been arrested after he was charged with lying to police when he claimed he was attacked and beaten by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama Empire, ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on January 29 that two apparent supporters of US President Donald Trump had struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him."

Sidibe's post was accompanied by a quote from civil rights icon Malcolm X on the ""irresponsible"" media, as well as a separate tweet speculating that people wouldn't believe Smollett's story even if there was video of the incident.

Smollett told Chicago police that he was assaulted around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two men who placed a rope around his neck and beat him with their fists. He alleged at the time that the two men, who he said were wearing masks, poured an unknown chemical on him.

CNN, citing multiple law law enforcement officials familiar with a probe into the alleged attack, reported on Saturday that police believe Smollett paid two men to carry out an assault.

The news network noted that police arrested two brothers last week in connection to their investigation. The men were released after the discovery of ""new evidence"" and are reportedly cooperating with law enforcement.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement over the weekend. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett's attorney denied that the actor played a part in the attack, saying in a statement that nothing was ""further from the truth.""

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, the studio for ""Empire,"" told The Hill Wednesday that Smollett remained a ""consummate professional on set,"" denying reports he is being written off the show."

On January 29, Smollett alleged that he was attacked in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood, in what was initially investigated as a hate crime. Police later alleged Smollett orchestrated the attack.

Shortly before Smollett was named as a suspect, the two brothers accused of conspiring with him to orchestrate the fake hate crime attack are seen on surveillance video apparently buying items used during the incident.

The video shows Ola and Abel Osundairo placing the masks and at least one hat on the counter.

Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two white men in ski masks who made racial and homophobic slurs, and said “This is MAGA country,” referencing President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” and used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault.

According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then “poured an unknown liquid” on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.

Smollett was not seriously injured.

Upcoming episodes of ‘Empire’ have been rewritten to reduce Smollett’s role.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage a racist, anti-gay attack on himself, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, turned himself in on charges that he filed a false police report last month when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked men who hurled derogatory remarks and looped a rope around his neck.

The actor “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” police, Johnson said.

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve,” Johnson added.

The attack reverberated well beyond Chicago and swiftly took on political overtones, with liberals calling it a shocking example of Trump-era hate. Republicans seized on the criminal charges as proof that Democrats had rushed to judgment and unfairly disparaged the president’s supporters as bigots.

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement also said Johnson’s Thursday afternoon press conference was “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Prosecutors released a four-page document that outlined their case against Smollett, who plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Related Police release 2 men questioned in Jussie Smollett case

For the alleged hoax, Smollett solicited the help of two muscular brothers. One of them was Abindola “Abel” Osundairo, a friend he worked out with and who worked on the show as a stand-in for another character. He also supplied Smollett with the drug ecstasy, prosecutors said.

“He probably knew he needed somebody with bulk,” Johnson said of Smollett’s decision to hire the pair.

A few days before Osundairo and his brother, Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were scheduled to fly to Nigeria, Smollett sent him a text that prosecutors said set the scheme in motion.

“Might need your help on the low,” he wrote his friend, according to the document.

During a meeting with the brothers, Smollett told them he wanted the attack to happen Jan. 28 near his apartment in the city’s Streeterville neighborhood, and that he wanted them to get his attention by calling out slurs, prosecutors said. He is accused of instructing them to put the rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell the MAGA remark, an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan during the 2016 campaign.

Smollett then gave one of the brothers $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps that resemble those worn by Trump supporters, according to prosecutors. He drove them to the spot where he wanted the attack to take place, taking time to show them the camera that he said would capture it.

He drove them home, wrote a check to one of the brothers for $3,500 and flew to New York, prosecutors said.

The time of the “attack” was pushed back to 2 a.m. Jan 29 because Smollett’s return flight was delayed. The brothers ordered an Uber ride to pick them up at their apartment and climbed into the vehicle toting their supplies, including bleach because there was a decision to use that instead of gasoline, according to prosecutors’ summary.

Police know much of this, they said, because Chicago has one of the world’s most extensive video surveillance systems. Investigators, in effect, pieced together the route the two men took by cab and foot to and from the scene, Johnson said.

The encounter lasted about 45 seconds. The brothers, Johnson said, “punched him a little bit,” but the scratches and bruises that Smollett had on his face were “most likely self-inflicted.”

When police arrived, he told them what happened and pointed out the nearby surveillance camera, prosecutors said at the court hearing.

Smollett also tried to mislead police about the suspects, telling them that the area around one attacker’s eyes was white skinned, even though the brothers are black, prosecutors said.

Johnson said Smollett used the one of the most terrifying symbols of racial hatred — a noose — that is synonymous with lynchings.

“I’m offended by what happened and I’m also angry,” he said.

By the time Smollett appeared on “Good Morning America” on Feb. 14, police already had a pretty good idea that he was lying, thanks to dozens of search warrants, subpoenas and extensive analysis of camera and phone records. They also knew the names of the brothers, and the fact that they had flown to Nigeria and were scheduled to return to Chicago on Feb. 13.

The men were arrested and questioned for hours. At hour 47 — one hour before police had to either charge the men or release them — Johnson said the two confessed to what they had done. They were subsequently released without being charged.

Prosecutors charged Smollett late Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct — the charge that is used for filing a false police report. He turned himself in to police Thursday and was jailed until an afternoon court appearance.

Smollett’s attorneys asked that the actor be freed on his own recognizance, but Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. rejected that idea. Lyke, who is also black, said he was bothered by the allegations involving the noose.

“The most vile and despicable part of it, if it’s true, is the noose,” he said. “That symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.”

The judge set Smollett’s bond at $100,000, and the actor soon walked out of jail after posting the necessary $10,000. He declined to comment to reporters.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The companies that make “Empire,” Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, issued a statement Thursday saying that they were “evaluating the situation” and “considering our options.”

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media. Referring to a published account of the attack, Trump said last month that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

On Thursday, he tweeted to Smollett: “What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA.”

But straight people should know about this shameful stain on the justice system, and one of our favorite comedians, Jaboukie Young-White, is doing his part to ensure they do.

Jaboukie appeared on last night’s episode of The Daily Show, and while sitting across from the show’s host, Trevor Noah, he offered up his thoughts on the Jussie Smollett scandal currently raging online. Amid his jokes about the scandal’s “crazy plot” (“I mean, Trump supporters who watch Empire?” he quips), about the actor-singer’s motive (“If he wanted attention, he could have just leaked his nudes”) and about hopefully playing Smollett in the sure-to-happen Lifetime movie version of what went down, Trevor Noah asks Jaboukie a question: “Won’t this make it harder for victims of real hate crimes to come forward and get justice?”

It’s something that has come up incessantly since the media first caught wind that Smollett’s account of events may have been fabricated. And while most would say, yes, it does create a harder time for true victims, Jaboukie looks at it differently: “Not really, because that would have required people to have cared about queer people, specifically queer Black people, in the first place.”

And while Trevor Noah attempts to push back against the idea that society “doesn’t care” about LGBTQ people of color, Jaboukie brings up the “gay panic” and “trans panic” defense as the perfect illustration (though, to be clear, the “gay panic” defense has been used in cases involving all colors of queer people).

Here’s how Jaboukie explains the “gay panic” defense, with a little humor mixed in:

It’s a totally admissible legal defense where someone can get a lighter sentence for killing a gay or trans person by claiming the victim hit on them. In 47 states, including New York, someone could beat a gay person like me to death and then go, “Well, I don’t know, he wanted to suck my dick.” And you know what? Maybe I did. But that’s still not a good reason, you know?

He also makes the funny-but-true point that if women were allowed to use a similar defense — if women could get away with killing men because they hit on them — there would quite literally be no men left.

Understanding the gay panic defense

While you won’t find “gay panic” listed as an official legal defense in law books, it’s often invoked in murder trials to help explain a defendant’s temporary insanity, diminished capacity or self-defense. Defense lawyers use it in hopes of getting first-degree murder charges reduced to second-degree (non-premeditated) murder or even manslaughter.

The “gay panic” defense (and its twin, the “trans panic” defense) was invoked in the trials following the 1993 murder of trans man Brandon Teena (of Boys Don’t Cry fame), the 1995 murder of Jenny Jones guest Scott Amedure, the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard and the 2008 murder of 14-year-old Larry King.

As recently as May 2018, in Texas, a 69-year-old former police officer was sentenced to just 10 years probation and six months in jail for stabbing his 32-year-old neighbor to death. He claimed Spencer tried to kiss him. Read about that case here.

While “gay panic” and “trans panic” defenses don’t always work in court, they apparently did in that Texas case. The defense essentially blames queer people for their own murders by claiming they provoked an attack. The defense also plays off societal queerphobia while reinforcing negative stereotypes of queer people as sexual deviants and predators.

Currently there is a legal movement to ban the “gay panic” defense nationwide.

2:20 PM PT -- Chicago PD says Jussie is now ""officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation"" ... and detectives began presenting evidence Wednesday afternoon to the grand jury.

The brothers who say Jussie Smollett hired them to stage the alleged attack were caught on surveillance camera buying a bunch of items they used during the incident.

The video -- first posted by CBS2 in Chicago -- shows Ola and Abel Osundairo at the checkout counter as they pile up the items, which include ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats.

At one point Abel pulls his hoodie over his head, perhaps attempting to hide his face, but he'd already been seen clearly on the video.

CBS2 says the brothers bought these items the day before the ""attack"" on Jussie.

The items are interesting ... we know Jussie said his attackers were wearing ski masks, and we also know police seized red hats when they raided the brothers' home in Chicago. The surveillance image police had released last month appears to show Abel and Ola with their faces still concealed under the ski masks.

As we first reported, the brothers were at court Tuesday, ready to testify for the grand jury -- but were called off at the last minute because Jussie's attorneys are going to speak to police.

We're told they will go before the grand jury when it finally convenes."

The Babylon Bee is a well-known satire site and yet, Snopes fact-checked one of their recent posts. They may as well fact check The Onion.



In any case, The Babylon Bee poked fun at both CNN and Jussie Smollett (the actor recently embroiled in an alleged hate crime hoax) in a satirical piece suggesting CNN offered Smollett a job.

Though Snopes acknowledged the Bee is a satire site, they fact-checked anyway:

On 18 February 2019, the Babylon Bee website added their own fictional twist to this story when they published an article reporting that Smollett had been offered a job at the CNN. The network, according to the Babylon Bee, was reportedly impressed with Smollett’s ability to fabricate a story out of thin air: While Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been having a tough week so far, there appears to be a silver lining: cable news channel CNN has offered Smollett a job as an investigative reporter and on-air anchor after witnessing his skills at fabricating a story entirely out of thin air. CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett’s apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn’t add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he’d be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated. This was not a genuine news story, although some readers mistook it for such. The Babylon Bee is a satirical website whose disclaimer notes that “The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.”

Photo: Dominik Bindl/Getty Images

We still don’t know exactly what happened in the Jussie Smollett case that has dominated the news cycle for the past week. What we do know is that after the Empire star revealed he was allegedly the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime, conflicting reports started to emerge suggesting that Smollett may have been involved in orchestrating the incident. Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, the two brothers who were originally considered suspects, both knew Smollett in advance of the attack and told Chicago police that they were hired by Smollett. After the Chicago PD announced they were “shifting the trajectory” of their investigation, Smollett said in a statement that he is “angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with” and that anyone claiming he played a role in his own attack “is lying.”

While it’s too soon to render a verdict on what exactly went down, if the case does prove to be a hoax, the ramifications are hard to overstate. As we’ve seen in the extremely rare cases involving false rape allegations, they serve as ammo for people looking to undermine the credibility of genuine victims (like clockwork, Donald Trump Jr. is already tweeting about Smollett’s story, in which his attackers were originally described as two men shouting, “This is MAGA country”). But what would motivate someone to pretend to be the victim of a hate crime? We called up Dr. Marc Feldman, who is not involved in the case but is an expert on factitious disorder and Munchausen syndrome by proxy, to learn more about “factitious victimization” — a disorder that causes people to feign victimhood for psychological reasons — and how it could come into play in the Smollett case.

What did you think when you first heard this case might be a hoax?

Munchausen syndrome refers to the most extreme examples of “factitious disorder,” which is the official psychiatric term for people who feign illness or injury for intangible reasons. Ever since I encountered my first case of a woman who faked cancer for emotional reasons back in 1989, I’ve obviously been more sensitive to that possibility than most people ever would be. I try not to falsely accuse people and that’s why I am approaching this subject with a little timidity. But when it does arise I think it’s important that we identify it and help educate the public about it.

This case made me think of factitious victimization because there have been some somewhat similar cases in the past where individuals have engineered their own apparent hate attacks, hate crimes, and it turns out the individual himself coordinated the whole thing. I first became aware of it in the context of the 9/11 attacks, where way more people claimed to have been victims than was conceivable. They claimed to be in the World Trade Center or they claimed to be first responders who suffered a lot of physical consequences. Some of them did it for money but there were also some people who seemed to do it just for the notoriety or the fame and the attention it would predictably attract. In my book Dying to Be Ill: True Stories of Medical Deception, I talked about a police officer who committed suicide but created a scenario in which it appeared he was a homicide victim in the line of duty, so he got a hero’s burial. That’s obviously an extreme case but he so badly wanted to be honored after his death that he contorted the situation to meet these emotional needs. And there are many other cases. I have studied factitious rape claims, and that’s another controversial area. The FBI says only about 5 percent of rape allegations reported to police are not true. But when it does arrive it can be extraordinarily disruptive.

As you said, it’s a controversial area; I think some people would argue that giving too much attention to these very rare false reports could be a way of sowing distrust about genuine accusations, which are much more common.

Of course you’re right. Even in a 1994 paper I wrote about it, it concluded by saying that even if a woman has a known history of deceptive behavior, new claims should be assiduously reviewed and analyzed as if they’re valid reports.

Is there a difference between cases where someone feigns sickness or feigns being the victim of a crime for a tangible gain like money or revenge versus more intangible aims?

If the behavior is deliberate in that the deception that has been planned and executed in a deliberate way in order to mislead other people, we would call that factitious disorder in most cases, or Munchausen syndrome. It used to be thought that all cases of Munchausen syndrome involved false illness claims. But in the most recent iteration of the DSM-5, they specify that people can feign illness, injury, or impairment. So, for example, there have been individuals who have faked being drug addicts because it has a certain cachet in certain communities like the rock music community, where you’re viewed as triumphant if you’ve been able to turn your back on such an addiction that in fact really didn’t even occur in your life. Malingering is the term we use when a person does it for tangible reasons like disability payments or opioid medications. And the two can coexist. With Smollett, there was at least the scuttlebutt originally that he was perhaps trying to ensure his continuing on Empire by presenting himself as a severe victim in another context, because it would be hard for the producers to let him go. And that would be malingering, if he sought to preserve his income, for instance. But if he also did it or did it exclusively for emotional reasons, we would call it Munchausen syndrome or factitious disorder.

Is Munchausen syndrome a mental illness that someone could claim in court, like as part of a “not guilty by reason of insanity” defense?

Yes. I don’t know of cases where that defense has succeeded, but the defense can be raised because it is an official psychiatric diagnosis. The American Psychiatric Association has recognized factitious disorder since 1980 and it has actually expanded [the] terms of its definition.

You mentioned something called factitious heroism, can you tell me how that may be relevant here?

It’s the correlate to factitious victimization, and we often see elements of both. Jussie has been clear about his own victimization, but at the same time his heroism, and talking about how the attackers ran away and not him, because he fought back. So he’s touting his own heroism at the same time he’s proclaiming his own victimization. You see that in the choice of cancer as an illness to be feigned in Munchausen syndrome, because we often think of people who have moved on from cancer as survivors and fighters, which is admired by society.

Presuming he did create this alleged hoax because he wanted some sort of attention or sympathy, what’s the kind of psychological profile you’d expect to see?

It would be very unusual to have someone who has good social and verbal skills and is successful to engage in factitious victimization. What we usually see in these cases is a personality disorder, which is that the individual has long-term problematic ways of trying to get emotional needs met and so they resort to the victim status as a way to almost instantly get what they feel unable to get by asking for [it] in a straightforward way. We tend to see a lot of people with borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder, and we don’t know all the reasons people develop those, but the Munchausen patients I’ve talked to often talk about emotional neglect as they are growing up, and as they got older their need to pretend to be ill to get attention grew more acute. They may have discovered that in childhood they only got authentic care when they were sick.

Were there things about this case that felt either typical or unusual to you in terms of a case of factitious disorder?

What’s atypical is Smollett’s success in life. Most of these individuals are not achievers, they don’t have many obvious talents, and the factitious victimization is an act of desperation, in essence a cry for help.

Can you think of any other cases where there’s been an alleged hoax of this sort with such a high-profile individual?



Not really. [If these allegations are true,] this case stands out in that respect. Does Mr. Smollett have this bottomless pit of need for attention, is there something about his personality structure that makes that the case? I don’t know, I would relish the opportunity to meet with him and talk with him about it.

If this does turn out to be a hoax, it would seem to set a terrible precedent that will make future victims of real hate crimes less likely to be believed.

I do think the residual effect of the Smollett claim is that we’ll be overeager to consider a claim might be false, and the right-wing advocates will make a big deal out of this; I saw one of the Trump boys has already posted. It’s a broad sociological and cultural concern. It is isn’t damage-free when someone invents a widely acknowledged hoax."

Smollett reported to police that he was attacked by two men yelling racist and homophobic slurs late last month. It has since been reported by multiple outlets that Chicago PD now believe Smollett may have paid the men to stage the attack. Smollett’s lawyers have denied the accusations.

As TheWrap previously reported, Smollett’s upcoming scenes on “Empire” this season are being trimmed as the investigation continues, though the scenes he already shot will not be affected and 20th Century Fox Television has since reiterated that he is not being written out of the show.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” the studio said in a statement."

Key Moments Since Jussie Smollett Reported Chicago Attack

CHICAGO—“Empire” actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police last month that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett told police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

On Jan. 30, Chicago police said they had reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtained and released images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

Reports of an assault on Smollett drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

On Jan. 31, Trump told reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying: “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Smollett’s family issued a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family said he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

On Feb. 1, Smollett issued a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He said he was working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

On Feb. 2, Smollett gave a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

On Feb. 12, Chicago police said Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police said the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett said he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

On Feb. 13, Chicago police picked up two men they identified as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire.” Police questioned the brothers and searched the apartment where the men live.

On Feb. 14, Chicago police said local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

On Feb. 15, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He said the men—identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria—are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

Chicago police released the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman said the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

On Feb. 16, police said the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned the two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police said they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers said the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

On Feb. 17, Chicago police said they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi said police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but said an interview has not been conducted.

Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

On Feb. 19, Chicago police investigated a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismissed the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided."

The “Empire” star previously gave false information to police when he was busted for drunk driving just more than a decade ago, CNN reports. This information comes to light as Smollett is currently being accused by Chicago police of orchestrating and funding a fake attack against himself.

The U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into whether he mailed hate letters to himself. As is customary, the FBI neither confirms nor denies an active investigation.

Smollett, who was 25 at the time of his earlier arrest, was slapped with charges of false impersonation after giving police his 18-year-old brother Jake’s name to authorities during the DUI stop in Los Angeles. Smollett even reportedly signed his younger brother’s name on the promise that he would appear in court.

After having his lie uncovered by authorities and appearing in court, Smollett pleaded no contest to three misdemeanors in total from the incident, driving under the influence and operating a vehicle without a license. The judge gave Smollett two years of probation, a fine and orders to complete an alcohol education and treatment program in May 2008.

Smollett’s criminal history becomes relevant as the actor, now 36, is widely believed by the police and many in the public sphere to have masterminded a fake beatdown in late January.

As rolling out previously reported, Smollett said he was assaulted in Chicago on January 29 by two men wearing ski masks. Smollett told police he had just arrived in the Windy City from New York and made a late-night run to a Subway when someone yelled: “Aren’t you that f—— ‘Empire’ n—–?!” He claimed the two attackers then jumped him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

A month later, the Chicago Police Department reportedly believes Smollett paid Nigerian brothers, identified as Ola and Abel Osundairo, to stage an attack on him. According to published reports, the brothers — who are bodybuilders and extras on the show “Empire” — said they know Smollett and that they have worked out with him. They reportedly are holed up in a secret location as they continue to cooperate with authorities.

Smollett maintains his innocence, and family members have expressed their outrage that he is being victimized twice because the veracity of his story is being questioned.

Because Smollett has not made himself readily available to Chicago law enforcement authorities to answer follow-up questions, his case is being fast-tracked to a grand jury. According to TMZ, “the focus is presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Jussie for allegedly filing a false police report.”"

8:25 p.m.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

4:50 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says two brothers who were arrested and later released from custody in connection with the attack reported by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have met with police and prosecutors at the courthouse.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the meeting happened Tuesday in Chicago. He also said that officers have determined a tip that the two men may have been in an elevator with Smollett last month was not credible. He said video evidence helped them make that determination.

Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

12:10 p.m.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

The last-minute call may have saved the “Empire” star from potentially being indicted for falsifying a police report.

The actor claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack last month in Chicago as he walked home in the middle of the night. Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, have told investigators they were paid by Smollett to stage the assault. But the entertainer and his attorneys vehemently deny this.

OTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Jussie Smollett’s Siblings Come to His Defense by Blaming the Media & Quoting Malcolm



A source close to the investigation tells CBS News the brothers were minutes from testifying in front of a grand jury Tuesday. But those plans were abruptly scrapped after prosecutors got the call from Smollett’s lawyers.

What was said during the call has not been revealed but the Cook County state’s attorney decided to postpone the brothers’ testimony.

Smollett has repeatedly denied staging the attack.

“I’m pissed off. How do you not believe that? It’s the truth!” he said recently on “Good Morning America.”

On Tuesday, two of Smollett’s siblings posted Instagram messages slamming media coverage of the case.

“It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal,” read a quote attributed to Malcolm X.

Two other siblings defended him last week.

Jake Smollett said, “When one is affected, we are all affected. So it definitely was a time we came together. And we are a strong family.”

On Tuesday, in response to reports the singer’s scenes in “Empire” were being scaled back, 20th Century Fox and Fox Entertainment said they are still standing behind their star.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” Fox said in a new statement on Wednesday."

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” the statement reads.

This release of this statement comes on the heels of an investigation where the details are changing constantly. Smollett claimed he was approached at 2:00 a.m. near his apartment in Chicago by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, who allegedly beat him, poured an unidentified substance on him, and placed a noose around his neck. The actor also said the men yelled “This is MAGA country!” referring to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make American Great Again.”

The police eventually arrested two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were initially labeled as suspects. This was dropped after Chicago police revealed that information received from the two individuals had changed the trajectory of the investigation.

Despite repeated requests from the police, there have been no indications that Smollet will meet with them for a second interview.

No charges have been filed against the actor yet, and his case is set to go before a grand jury as early as this week.

Meanwhile, Smollett has lawyered up, reportedly hiring defense attorney Mark Geragos, who’s apparent defense will be that Smollett is being framed by the Chicago Police Department.

Fox’s statement comes after reports that Smollett’s character in Empire, Jamal Lyon, was being written out of the Fox drama, or was having his screen time slashed following the emergence of questions and doubts concerning the alleged attack.

Empire’s ratings have been declining over the past two seasons, leading some to believe the Smollett scandal could contribute to the cancellation of the show.

The producers would logically wait until the completion of the police investigation to make a final decision about Smollett’s future, but some are confused over the sudden show of support in the middle of the case.

Concerning his future with the show, there are reports that in Empire’s second-to-last episode of the season, Smollett’s role has been reduced from nine scenes to four.

A song he was scheduled to perform has also been cut, which lead to rumors that producers were gradually writing him out of the series."

Kenyatta Jones told the Daily Beast that she repeatedly calls Chicago police about leads in her daughter’s July 30 murder to no avail. The woman’s daughter, Oceanea Jones, 21, was with her boyfriend when four men reportedly approached and pursued the pair, mistaking her boyfriend for a gang member.

Oceanea was fatally shot in the back while running away from the suspects, who remain unidentified months later, according to the Daily Beast.

Kenyatta claimed only one detective is working to solve her daughter’s case, telling the outlet she believes they’re probably overburdened by other cases. However, slain’s woman’s mother said she can’t help to think that Smollett’s reported attack is taking a good amount of local police’s attention and resources which could’ve been used to get justice for Oceanea.

Smollett, 35, who is black and openly gay, reportedly told police that two masked assailants asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” moments before the January 29 assault. He claimed the suspects then tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid on him before fleeing the scene.

“It’s what everybody is talking about,” Kenyatta said, referring to the “Empire” actor’s story.

“There are so many unsolved murders in Chicago.”

Smollett’s story has been scrutinized in recent days, with reports alleging that paid two brothers to orchestrate the attack. An official told ABC News that suspects Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were released from custody after claiming Smollett staged the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter previously sent to him didn’t get more attention.

Meanwhile, Kenyatta revealed she recently told Chicago police that she’ll be working to solve her daughter’s murder, explaining that she’s received names of possible suspects.

She said, “I told [the detective] I’ve been doing my own little investigating myself.”

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

• TIMELINE Jussie Smollett’s reported attack and its investigation

Fox Television said Wednesday that Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and it has reiterated that he’s not being written out of the show.

The statement by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into reported attack.

Geragos’ celebrity clientele over the years has included pop superstar Michael Jackson, who hired and fired Geragos ahead of his trial on child molestation charges, and, more recently, former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick.

The move to hire an attorney with ample experience handling cases that attract national attention comes as police and prosecutors this week talked with two men who had previously been identified by police as “potential suspects” in the attack on Smollett, one of whom had worked as Smollett’s personal trainer and had appeared on an episode of “Empire.”

Before he was retained, Geragos appeared on CNN and discussed the Smollett case with Anderson Cooper, expressing concern over the unusually high number of leaks in the case attributed to law enforcement sources.

“Any time you get law enforcement drip-drip-drip leaks, that to me is a telltale sign that something else is going on here,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything except leaks according to law enforcement sources. To me, that screams out somebody is trying to manipulate something.”

Police had said they wanted to interview Smollett to discuss information gleaned from the two men that has “changed the trajectory” of the investigation. The two men, bodybuilding brothers from Chicago who were detained by police after arriving at O’Hare Airport on a return flight from Nigeria, spent Tuesday afternoon in the offices adjacent to the grand jury room, talking with investigators, but did not testify before the grand jury. The two were seen walking into the same room once again Wednesday afternoon.

Actor-singer Jussie Smollett's legal team just made a major pivot in the ongoing investigation into his alleged hate crime attack.

On Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019, the Empire star's lawyers allegedly made a ""Hail Mary"" call to the prosecuting team in an effort to postpone a grand jury testimony in Chicago, Ill., CBS News reports.

According to sources cited by TMZ the following day, prosecutors reportedly agreed to delay the scheduled courthouse proceedings given that Smollett's ""legal team — and possibly Jussie himself — had agreed to talk to police."" As Chicago's CBS 2 previously revealed, Smollett initially declined the follow-up interview request this week amid reports that he'd orchestrated the incident.

At the time of this writing, this meeting in question has not yet taken place. However, Variety reports that any evidence revealed during the grand jury, in which brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were meant to testify, may have led to Smollett's indictment on felony charges of allegedly falsifying a police report.

As Nicki Swift previously reported, Smollett, 36, claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime attack in the Windy City late last month. During the alleged incident, which took place on Jan. 29, 2019, the TV star was reportedly physically assaulted by two men, who poured a chemical believed to be bleach on him before putting a noose around his neck. The attackers in question also reportedly called Smollett racist and homophobic slurs and made a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Smollett, who sought medical attention at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, later claimed in a statement to Essence magazine that he'd been ""100% factual and consistent"" while speaking with the Chicago Police Department, who were treating the incident as a possible hate crime. At the time, he believed that ""justice will be served.""

It certainly seemed that way when the Osundairo brothers were taken into police custody as potential suspects last Wednesday, Feb. 13 (via CBS Chicago). However, the investigation shifted focus shortly after the Nigerian brothers, who have professional ties to Smollett (via the Daily Mail), were interrogated. They have since been released without charges, and are currently cooperating with the investigation.

It was first revealed over the weekend that authorities believed Smollett may have paid the brothers off to stage the attack. According to ABC News, the Osundairo brothers have also claimed that Smollett sent a racist, homophobic letter to himself at Cinespace Studios a week before the alleged attack. The letter in question included a drawing of a gun pointed at a stick figure hanging from a tree, a white powdery substance, which turned out to be crushed up aspirin, and letters cut out from a magazine, which read, ""You will die black f*g"" (via CBS Chicago). Sources cited by the news network recently claimed, ""When the letter didn't get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.""

The FBI is currently investigating the letter (via Page Six).

At the time of this writing, the Chicago PD has yet to publicly confirm or deny the ongoing speculation amid its investigation. However, a number of celebs and politicians have taken to social media to comment on the matter over the last few weeks.

It should also be noted that Smollett himself has not publicly responded to these accusations. However, he previously said during last week's interview with Good Morning America, ""At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.""

Meanwhile, his attorneys have continued to deny the claims on Smollett's behalf. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" his legal team stated in part to CNN on Saturday, Feb. 16. ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

While we wait to hear more on Smollett's case, his standing with FOX appears to be on steadier ground than previously thought. On Wednesday, Feb. 20, the network released a statement in response to a recent TMZ report. The gossip rag previously claimed that Smollett's role on an upcoming episode of Empire, on which he plays Jamal Lyon, had been cut down significantly due to these rumors. ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated,"" FOX stated to NBC News. ""He is not being written out of the show."""

The Jussie Smollett case would have made a compelling storyline on the actor’s hip-hop soap opera, but unfortunately, it’s all too real.

Police are investigating the 36-year-old star of Fox’s Empire following allegations he helped stage a Jan. 29 attack in the Streeterville area of Chicago. Smollett, who is Black and gay, telephoned police after he allegedly claimed two Trump supporters jumped him at 2am while he was walking to his apartment. Initial reports of the incident claimed the assailants tied a noose around his neck and doused him in bleach while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. “This is MAGA country!” they allegedly yelled.

Just over three weeks later, Chicago police now believe that he orchestrated the attack. The two suspects brought in for questioning by authorities, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundair, are Nigerian brothers who claim they were paid $3,500 for pretending to target him for being “that Empire f****t.”

Smollett denies the allegations. Fox has rejected claims the assault was staged because he was being written off Empire, calling the actor a “consummate professional.” Meanwhile, the case could be headed to a grand jury in the coming weeks.

What’s troubling about the Smollett incident isn’t merely that a well-known celebrity may have faked a hate crime (for reasons that remain unclear) but that this attack will be used to discredit and diminish anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the future. The LGBTQ magazine the Advocate reported that Donald Trump Jr. had tweeted about the allegations against Smollett 35 times by 1pm on Tuesday. He has posted 27 more tweets about the potentially faked assault in just two days.

Some of these tweets illustrate how the incident is being used to paint the LGBTQ community as unreliable narrators of our own lives. One is an article from the Federalist, a conservative website, listing alleged hate crime hoaxes. Linking to another thread on allegations of faked hate crimes, Trump Jr. dismisses claims the Smollett attack represents “one case and it rarely happens that way.”

It’s pretty rich to be lectured about hate crime reporting from the son of a president who imparts racist rhetoric and was accused of sexually assaulting more than 20 women before getting elected—and admitted to doing so on tape—but welcome to 2019.

Of course, Trump Jr. has a rooting interest in using the Smollett case as a cudgel against LGBTQ hate crime victims. His father’s presidency has led to extreme increases in violence against minority communities. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigations reported hate crimes had increased for the third consecutive year. An estimated 17.3 percent of those incidents were motivated by the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), anti-LGBTQ homicides increased by 86 percent between 2016 and 2017.

LGBTQ people are more likely to be targeted for a bias attack than any other segment of the population. These incidents are common enough that two other anti-LGBTQ hate crimes made news this week: Four men were charged with beating a gay couple outside an Austin, Texas, gay bar in January, while a gay man in Salt Lake City recorded his own assault on his smartphone.

These numbers don’t even include the more than a dozen LGBTQ centers that have been vandalized, threatened, or had their windows shot out since Trump announced his campaign for the presidency in 2015. These incidents include an attack on a trans employee of a Washington, D.C., community center who was hospitalized after an intruder broke in through the front door and pepper-sprayed her in 2017. Local resident Andrew Cook was later prosecuted for assault and destruction of property, the latter a felony charge.

LGBTQ people do sometimes lie about being targeted for violence. However, cases like Calum McSwiggan—a gay YouTuber who was accused by West Hollywood police of faking his June 2016 assault—are relatively rare. The FBI estimates that between two and eight percent of hate crimes are found to be hoaxes.

The sad reality is we don’t need people like Trump Jr. to dismiss the abuse far too many LGBTQ people face every day. Law enforcement agencies already do that. A July 2018 investigation conducted by Washington, D.C.’s local Fox affiliate surveyed anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the Beltway and found that prosecutors declined to press charges in 49 percent of cases. Of the 43 incidents, not a single assailant faced jail time as a result.

These issues are compounded by the fact that 87 percent of law enforcement agencies failed to report a single bias incident to the FBI in 2017. That means dozens more cases like the D.C. community center are going unreported.

Fifteen states still don’t have LGBTQ-inclusive hate crimes protections on the books at all. A proposal to add sexual orientation and gender identity to Indiana’s existing hate crime laws was recently dropped, and Senate Republicans in Utah are blocking LGBTQ inclusions in their state’s law over concerns they would usurp religious freedom.

This is why so many LGBTQ hate crime victims don’t come forward. The laws that do exist were not created to ensure a path to justice, and conservative lawmakers continue to oppose expanding legislation to fix those holes. Meanwhile, one of the most influential Republicans in the country is exploiting an extreme outlier to make it even more difficult for the United States to ever repair this broken system.

Jussie Smollett might have lied; no one really knows until a jury has had time to deliberate his case. However, countless LGBTQ victims of physical assault are telling the truth and aren’t being heard. Treating Smollett’s case as anything but an exception to a dangerous and deadly rule will ensure they continue to be silenced."

In the case of Jussie Smollett, the gay African American who cried MAGA, his Hollywood producers are BFFs. On Wednesday The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that showrunners for TV Drama Empire have no plans to cut Smollett from the show, despite the fact that he probably committed a felony at the expense of legitimate police matters and conservatives everywhere.

So while he may have to pay his debt to society in Cook County, he’s all square with the powers that be in Tinsel Town.

THR reported that both “Fox and Empire producer 20th Century Fox TV said they stand by the actor's on-set conduct,” and as such he will not be cut from the show. The network and studio released a statement on Tuesday denying rumors that the allegedly race-baiting liar is out of a job.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.” Within the last few days, speculation had been circulating that the 36-year-old Smollett was either having his time on screen gradually cut back or that he had altogether been removed from the show’s “schedule.”

Both Fox and Empire declined to say whether they were considering reducing Smollett’s screen time, and have demonstrated that they are fully standing by and defending the star as his alleged victimhood in the “MAGA country” hate crime is being called into question.

THR claimed that the studio and Empire producers have been fighting off rumors since the beginning, furiously denying Smollett’s departure from the series as being “patently ridiculous.” Both Fox and 20th Century Fox asserted, “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Looks like Hollywood protects its own.

Smollett’s lawyers are still vehemently denying the idea that Smollett staged his own “lynching.” Well that’s a given, but Smollett and his legal team insist that he’s being further victimized by public speculation.

Attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson spoke for Smollett, saying, “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.” In another statement, they claimed, “nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

We’ll have to wait and see how everything settles, but the actor should rest easy knowing that the whole world definitely wants justice for Jussie Smollett."

Even liberals can’t spin this for Jussie Smollett, the actor who appears to have faked a hate crime against him. On January 29, Smollett, star of the Fox series “Empire,” said two white men attacked him. They punched in the face, had bleach poured on him, and had a rope tied around his neck. The assailants hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him. Now, it turns out the so-called attackers were two Nigerian brothers, one of which an extra on Empire while the other was reportedly his former personal trainer. Smollett allegedly paid them over $3,000; they bought the rope used in the so-called assault and even held rehearsals. The brothers are cooperating with police and say that this incident was allegedly sparked when a racist letter with white powder sent to Smollett didn’t get enough media attention. The powder was later determined to be aspirin.

Oh, and Smollett reportedly created the racist letter. It’s a full-blown mess and it’s quite possible Smollett could be charged with filing a false police report. Daily Show host Trevor Noah went off-script to not only say this story makes zero sense, but also that this is a classic example of confirmation bias, which liberals fell victim to since they jumped on the bandwagon that this was a horrific hate crime. Some prominent members of the 2020 Democratic field said that this was a ‘modern-day lynching.’ The liberal media peddled it as fact. It wasn’t (via Slate):





As he often does during breaks in taping, Noah went off-script as he addressed the Smollett investigation and the dangers of confirmation bias in a country that is already deeply divided. “We live in a world where people are too enthusiastic at jumping at stories that confirm their biases, and instead of just pausing and going, ‘what do I make of the story,’” Noah warned. “That’s when I think you have to be even more vigilant, is when it confirms everything you’ve believed.” The late night host went on to remind the audience that neither side is immune to this practice, however that is not an excuse to continue it. “This goes for both sides,” said Noah. “But I think increasingly as Trump’s come into power, people have become increasingly willing to accept a story that confirms anything about a Trump supporter or Trump or a white person.”

Concerning the latest updates, a grand jury hearing has been postponed (via PageSix):

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett may end up dodging potential indictment charges thanks to a last-minute phone call his lawyers made to prosecutors, according to a report Wednesday. The “Hail Mary” call was made Tuesday — just moments before brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were set to testify before a grand jury in Chicago, a source close to the investigation told CBS News. It’s not exactly clear what Smollett’s lawyers told prosecutors, but it was enough for the Cook County prosecutors to postpone the proceeding. The grand jury was supposed to begin hearing evidence that could have resulted in the TV actor being indicted on felony charges of filing a false police report.

CNN added that police are reportedly asking for Smollett’s financial records as well. This slow-moving trainwreck isn’t done yet.

UPDATE: Well, here’s the footage of the Nigerian brothers buying items used in the alleged hate crime that’s looking more like a total hoax (via CBS Chicago):

CBS 2 has obtained exclusive video of two men linked to the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett buying a red hat and ski masks from a store the day before the assault. The video shows what appears to be Ola and Abel Osundairo placing the masks and a hat on the counter. Smollett has claimed two men wearing a similar hat and masks attacked him on Jan. 29 in Streeterville, according to police. CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar made multiple phone calls and visited several stores to obtain the video.

UPDATE II: Smollett is now a suspect in the hate crime he very well may have orchestrated (via Fox News):

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was “officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation” by authorities on Wednesday for allegedly “filing a false police report” in connection with his attack claims, Chicago police said. The update in the case was provided by the department's Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi on Twitter. Detectives on the case were laying out evidence to a grand jury in Cook County, he said."

Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5WPR in Manhattan, says Jussie Smollett‘s career is caput if the incident was a phony crime he orchestrated by paying two black men to attack him, wrap a noose around his neck and yell, “This is MAGA country!”

Chicago Police are still investigating. (RELATED: Here’s Why Jussie Smollett May Have Faked The Crime)

“What brand would want to be affiliated with such a divisive liar like Smollett?” the crisis dude asks rhetorically. “What show or program would want to be affiliated with this actor? The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot. If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

Torossian, who has handled PR for Snoop Dogg, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Nick Cannon, says there are a couple ways to look at this —all of which are dismal for Smollett.

“Generally, in the world of crisis, there [are] two courts to worry about, the court of law and the court of public opinion,” he says. “In the court of law, it’s likely Smollett will be arrested soon for lying. In the court of public opinion, no one will want to stand near someone who paid his friends to stage an attack on him.”

Smollett is clearly anti-Trump. He also appears to have a history of lying. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett Pleaded No Contest For Giving Officials False Info In 2007)

The media hasn’t escaped criticism. Ex-NBCer Megyn Kelly, who was fired for saying dressing up in blackface for Halloween is no biggie, blasted the media for handling the story so badly.

Torossian believes the actor’s career is over. “Smollett is likely to be remembered only for this incident, and I think his Hollywood career is over,” he says.

He advises the Empire star to fess up while he still can.

“As questions mount, the public will be listening extra closely,” he says. “And in the age we live in, everything becomes known eventually, so it’s better to fess up and try to guide the narrative. When a crisis strikes, as it almost inevitably does for public figures, transparency and disclosure [are] key.”

Unfortunately, this crisis expert sees no path of redemption.

“Jussie’s reputation will never be fully restored in the public eye,” he says. “His career is over. This is a career-halting problem which he has created.”

Moral of this story: Jussie Smollett should not hire Ronn Torossian."

A study looking into the wedding planning habits and behaviors of 2,000 Americans who have had a wedding in the last year and found that the average engaged person spends 12 hours a week planning their wedding.

This means the average engaged American will find themselves in wedding planning mode over the course of 11 months — or 44 weeks– logging 528 hours of planning from engagement to the big day.

The survey also uncovered the most time-consuming parts of the entire wedding planning process, finding that the perfect venue came in as the number one time-consuming activity — a quarter of those surveyed admitted that this was the most challenging and tedious part of the process.

The study, by Minted, looked into the wedding planning journey of the 2,000 people surveyed to find that hunting for the perfect wedding dress, deciding who will be in the wedding party, and arranging the catering also ranked high among the most time-consuming elements of any wedding planning process.

Planning a wedding is no easy feat but the majority of engaged couples were excited and happy (68 percent and 53 percent, respectively), while they planned their big day.

However, for some, planning a wedding can be overwhelming. The average couple said they had four disagreements along the way, and even a few tears at times.

But what are the wedding elements couples are prone to disagree about? For a quarter of those surveyed (25 percent) finding the right venue was a source of contention.

Meanwhile, 18 percent of engaged couples clashed about arranging the catering and another 19 percent disagreed over who would be in the wedding party.

Not all couples clashed during the wedding planning process, though. Turns out nearly a quarter (23 percent) had zero disagreements with their partner as they planned their big day.

In fact, selecting save the date cards and picking the flower girl and ring-bearer were wedding features that partners often agree on.

For the majority of those studied (94 percent), having the help of their partner made the whole thing a lot easier and more enjoyable. And a whopping 46 percent wouldn’t change a thing about their special day.

The majority (84 percent) also agreed that their partner’s input in the wedding planning process was helpful — with 78 percent revealing their partner wanted to provide input.

“We know that coming together to celebrate such an important milestone, like a wedding, is equally rewarding and time consuming. However, creating meaningful moments, complete with personal touches and intimate elements, is what makes a couple’s big day so special.” a spokesperson for Minted Weddings said.

And on a more productive note, the wedding planning process can be a good exercise for couples to see how they get along in stressful situations.

For 83 percent of those surveyed, it was easy to agree with their partner, making the wedding planning journey a lot more manageable.

That doesn’t mean that wedding planning doesn’t come without its share of stressors, even if both people are getting along and agreeing on key elements of the big day.

Eighteen percent stressed about pleasing their in-laws while a further 17 percent of women worried about finding the perfect wedding dress for their big day.

Although the majority of recently married couples were happy and excited while wedding planning, there were some things that people would change about their big day.

The top items wedding couples would do differently were choice of photographer, venue, and wedding planner.

(Or just play classical music?) Regurgitating press releases from discredited lefty scammers may thrill the pledge drive and protest types, but the rest of us just ain’t getting our money’s worth.

For instance, the garbage February 20 NPR web story by Leila Fadel, an unquestioning recitation of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s latest phony “hate group” statistics.

“For the fourth year in a row, The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that tracks hate groups, reports that hate and domestic extremism are rising in an unabated trend,” Fadel types. “The center found a 30 percent increase in U.S. hate groups over the past four years and a 7 percent increase in hate groups in 2018 alone.” Scary stuff.

Why’s it happening? Oh, you know: “President Trump, his administration, right-wing media outlets” and, as SPLC itself asserts, “hysteria over losing a white-majority nation to demographic change.”

Fadel transcribes a statement from SPLC’s Heidi Beirich: “Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as president of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it – with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to to act on their worst instincts.”

People across America? Are we talking the Virginia Democratic Party or those MAGA thugs who attacked Jussie Smollett?

SPLC isn’t a “civil rights organization.” (It once was, many decades ago. When the KKK was thing. Like during the Nixon administration.) It’s certainly not, as Fadel enthuses, “a revered civil rights watchdog [sic] group.” (Although exiled Nigerian oil ministers think pretty highly of it.) It’s a progressive direct mail giant -- a lefty hate group that makes money screaming “Hate Group” at anyone to the right of, well, NPR. As a matter of fact, in 2017 conservative leaders formally asked media outlets to cut ties with SPLC because it’s “Hate Map” and “hate reports” are used to slime conservative groups and silence political opponents.

To her credit, Fadel did mention that “Critics accuse the group of overblowing the threat of hate and including groups and individuals on its lists who might not belong,” and cited an especially embarrassing apology SPLC was forced to cough up (along with $3.4 million) to an anti-Muslim extremism activist it had smeared.

Of course, you had to wade five paragraphs into the flack prose to learn that SPLC is an agenda-driven slime machine. She didn’t mention that the Department of Defense has completely erased all SPLC related training materials on extremism from its Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI), or that the FBI also “distanced itself” from the SPLC. And you never got to hear from anyone negatively impacted by its “hate group” designation.

Like Leo Johnson, building manager at the Family Research Council. Johnson took a gunshot wound subduing Floyd Lee Corkins in 2012 when the unhinged gay activist entered the FRC’s office in D.C. with a plan to kill everyone there and stuff their lifeless mouths full of Chick-fil-A. He got the idea from SPLC’s “Hate Map,” which listed FRC, a Christian organization focusing on traditional values. (James Hodgkinson was also an SPLC fan. He was the Bernie Bro who shot up the Republican baseball practice and nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise. But, you know, hate only flows in one direction.)

FRC isn’t the only distinctly non-hate-based groups have been slimed by SPLC, ACT for America, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Clarion Project have been targeted, among others.

Pro tip: All that’s good info to include when you’re claiming to do “journalism,” especially on the taxpayer’s dime. Otherwise, you’re just putting the PR in NPR."

A grand jury heard evidence in the case and found probable cause that the ""Empire"" actor staged the incident, which he portrayed as a hate crime.

Smollett is charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct. He's due in court Thursday.

He had told police he was brutally attacked by two men as he walked home in the early hours of Jan. 29. He said they yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him before putting a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene.

There had been skepticism over his account, but Smollett has maintained he had nothing to do with the alleged attack. His attorneys say he's ""angered and devastated"" by the allegations he paid two men to stage the incident.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” his attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement prior to the charge being filed Wednesday evening.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox, the network behind ""Empire,"" said it was standing by him.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" Fox said in a statement shared before police released the new information.

Inside Edition learned earlier Wednesday that Smollett was once prosecuted for lying to police in Los Angeles about his name, telling officers who pulled him over he was actually named ""Jake"" — his younger brother's name, court records show. He pleaded no contest in the case and was put on probation.

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Jussie Smollett remains a cast member in the televised drama ""Empire,"" Fox Entertainment said on Wednesday, in a show of support for the actor after a report said he had staged an attack on himself because he was being written off the show.

Smollett, 36, last month told police in Chicago that two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs had accosted him on the street and put a rope around his neck. Smollett, an openly gay African-American man, also plays a gay man on the show.

The news sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett's account when apparent inconsistencies began to surface.

ABC 7 Chicago last week quoted unnamed sources saying Smollett staged the attack to gain publicity because he was losing his role on ""Empire,"" a drama about a battle for control of a hip-hop musical empire.

But Chicago police said there was no evidence to support that report.

The company that produces the show issued a statement on Wednesday supporting Smollett. ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said.

Police have not found any surveillance video of the reported attack, which they said was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Detectives last week questioned two unnamed men identified from surveillance camera footage showing two people walking on a sidewalk near where Smollett said he was assaulted. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Friday the two were released without being charged.

The case took another turn on Tuesday after Chicago police began investigating a tip that Smollett was seen inside his apartment building with the two men who were being questioned. Guglielmi later said the tip was ""unfounded"" and not supported by video evidence.

Guglielmi said on Sunday detectives were attempting to speak with Smollett again to follow up on his initial report of an attack on Jan. 29.

In an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might stem from racial bias. (Reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)"

I wanted to write about how the incident was an example of why homophobic jokes are never just jokes. About how we pave the way for anti-Black and anti-LGBT violence.

That’s still true, by the way. But the more I dug into the Jussie accusations and his side of the story, the more skeptical I became. I feared that writing an article using him as the fulcrum for a discussion about the violence that impacts Black queer folk in America might be torn apart by the fact I was becoming more convinced his story wasn’t true. So I didn’t write anything. I waited. I listened to the evidence. And now, it’s just hard to find a scenario in which Smollett comes out as having told the truth.

But Jussie and his individual act of seeming manipulative dishonesty have resulted in weeks of incendiary back-and-forth that has only reminded us of the worst inclinations of those around us.

So what did we learn? Let’s start with what we didn’t learn.

We didn’t learn that there are those who will leverage their space as allies who gain our trust and use that leverage to harm us in ways we didn’t think were imaginable. If it’s proven that Jussie Smollett lied, then he committed an act of violence against the Black LGBT community. He abused the trust he’s gained over the past five years as an activist. Because let’s be clear: A lot of people believed Jussie’s story because Jussie told the story and he’d earned the credibility to be believed. If any number of other people had told the story then those who rallied behind Jussie would have surely relied on the evidence present before speaking out. Jussie was loved because we thought Jussie loved us in a way that would stop him from harming us like he did. But, as mentioned, people will abuse that love. We didn’t learn that this week, because we already knew that.

We didn’t learn that celebrating the idea that Jussie lied is cruel, but people will celebrate having their beliefs affirmed more than caring about who those beliefs impact. Nobody wins by Jussie lying. Black men who felt attacked and are now proven right are taking victory laps. Racists who want to make us believe that racism doesn’t exist are taking victory laps. Homophobic people who want to downplay how we’ve destroyed so many LGBT people’s lives are taking victory laps. But really the only humane reaction here is ultimately sadness if it is revealed that Jussie manipulated so many people.

We didn’t learn that the worst among us will use this lie to justify their refusal to believe the plight of subjugated people around us lead life-threatening existences for simply living in their truth. There has been, and will persist, a fear that this lie – if proven to be just that – will only be fodder for people who already want to dismiss claims of racist and homophobic violence. Those people aren’t suddenly skeptical. They always have been and will just use this to confirm their hatred. We already knew that would happen.

We didn’t learn that the police suddenly become reliable sources of information to those who simply want to reaffirm their hatred. We already knew that.

Jussie’s story was always unlikely: the 2am trip to Subway; the noose around his neck; the lack of video evidence. It was always a convergence of unlikely circumstances for his story to be real. But you know what is just as unlikely? The idea that Jussie Smollett concocted a scheme because he was getting written off of a TV show. However, that was the story peddled by right-wing sites whose sole purpose was to discredit Smollett as a way to discredit actual Black and queer victims of violence. Discernment has to work both ways and refusing to believe Smollet’s story then believing unsourced stories that sound more like alt-right fan fiction than anything grounded in facts is an intentional refusal to discern. That’s just using white supremacist outlets to confirm your own hatred. But this isn’t new information as we’ve seen those who view liberation solely through cisgendered lenses yell about police misinformation when Black men are killed by cops but will ask us to defer to the letter of the law when a Bill Cosby accusation gets tossed out in court.

We didn’t learn that the media will parrot irresponsible false information that threatens Black gay lives, because we already knew that too.

We didn’t learn that Jussie Smollett wasn’t the “gay Tupac” because we damn well knew that from the jump.

We didn’t learn that sometimes valid criticisms of Black men can get replaced by performative targeting of Black men that doesn’t uplift those who are victimized by us nor works to hold us accountable for any of the ways we hurt folks. Calling out Black men for our role in creating an environment in which men like Jussie Smollett get attacked is legitimate. Investigating those ways in which Black men have and continue to endanger everyone else in the Black community is something that needs to be discussed as often as possible until changes are made. But this wasn’t it.

We didn’t learn that there are some Black men who were very happy to align with alt-right sources of misinformation because they don’t stand with Black gay men. Yes, there were some Black men who were legitimately wary of Jussie’s claims for the right reasons. But there were also some who are trumpeting their right-ness as some sort of referendum on how straight Black men need to be treated by the rest of the Black community. The fact is there are some Black men who wouldn’t have sympathized with Jussie even if his claims were true. We already knew this because we have seen them defend R. Kelly, Chris Brown and others who have been violently anti-Black.

The fact has persisted that information doesn’t matter so much as finding space to confirm things we already believe, especially if those beliefs are rooted in other people’s oppression. We already know that truth isn’t as important as the cognitive dissonance confirmation biases allow. The Jussie Smollett case has allowed so many people’s hatred for others to find something to hold onto. A space to sink their teeth into and an anchor to for which them to tether their oppressive nature. Learning isn’t the goal for much anyone reacting to the case.

So what have we learned? Maybe the only thing for us to learn here is that there is no end to the depths of unlearning we have to do to get free.

The first “coup” in U.S. history in which government bureaucrats sought to overturn an election and to remove a sitting U.S. president has failed, a columnist noted.

“Not thugs in sunglasses and epaulettes, not oligarchs in private jets, not shaggy would-be Marxists, but sanctimonious arrogant bureaucrats in suits and ties used their government agencies to seek to overturn the 2016 election, abort a presidency, and subvert the U.S. Constitution,” Victor Davis Hanson wrote on Feb. 17 in an op-ed titled ‘Autopsy of a Dead Coup’ for the Center for American Greatness.

“And they did all that and more on the premise that they were our moral superiors and had uniquely divine rights to destroy a presidency that they loathed,” Hanson wrote.

The effort by the Hillary Clinton campaign “to create, disseminate among court media, and then salt among high Obama administration officials, a fabricated, opposition smear dossier failed,” Hanson noted.

“So has the second special prosecutor phase of the coup to abort the Trump presidency failed. There are many elements to what in time likely will become recognized as the greatest scandal in American political history.”

Hanson continued: “The deep state is by nature cowardly. It does not move unless it feels it can disguise its subterranean efforts or that, if revealed, those efforts will be seen as popular and necessary – as expressed in tell-all book titles such as fired FBI Directors James Comey’s Higher Loyalty or in disgraced Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe’s psychodramatic The Threat.

“In candidate and President Trump’s case that prepping of the battlefield translated into a coordinated effort among the media, political progressives and celebrities to so demonize Trump that his imminent removal likely would appear a relief to the people. Anything was justified that led to that end.”

Hanson noted that “Journalists themselves consulted with the Clinton campaign to coordinate attacks. From the WikiLeaks trove, journalistic grandees such as John Harwood, Mark Leibovich, Dana Milbank, and Glenn Thrush often communicated (and even post factum were unapologetic about doing so) with John Podesta’s staff to construct various anti-Trump themes and have the Clinton campaign review or even audit them in advance.

“Some contract ‘journalists’ apparently were paid directly by Fusion GPS – created by former reporters Glen Simpson of the Wall Street Journal and Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post – to spread lurid stories from the dossier. Others more refined like Christiane Amanpour and James Rutenberg had argued for a new journalistic ethos that partisan coverage was certainly justified in the age of Trump, given his assumed existential threat to The Truth.”

Or as Rutenberg put it in 2016: “If you view a Trump presidency as something that’s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you’ve ever been to being oppositional. That’s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, non-opinion journalist I’ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable. But the question that everyone is grappling with is: Do normal standards apply? And if they don’t, what should take their place?”

Hanson wrote: “I suppose Rutenberg never considered that half the country might have considered the Hillary Clinton presidency ‘potentially dangerous,’ and yet did not expect the evening news, in 90 percent of its coverage, to reflect such suspicions.”

CNN “soon proved that it is no longer a news organization at all – as reporters like Gloria Borger, Chris Cuomo, Eric Lichtblau, Manu Raju, Brian Rokus, Jake Tapper, Jeff Zeleny, and teams such as Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein, and Marshall Cohen as well as Thomas Frank, and Lex Harris all trafficked in false rumors and unproven gossip detrimental to Trump, while hosts and guest hosts such as Reza Aslan, the late Anthony Bourdain, and Anderson Cooper stooped to obscenity and grossness to attack Trump,” Hanson wrote.

“Both politicos and celebrities tried to drive Trump’s numbers down to facilitate some sort of popular ratification for his removal. Hollywood and the coastal corridor punditry exhausted public expressions of assassinating or injuring the president, as the likes of Jim Carrey, Johnny Depp, Robert de Niro, Peter Fonda, Kathy Griffin, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, and a host of others vied rhetorically to slice apart, shoot, beat up, cage, behead, and blow up the president.

“Left wing social media and mainstream journalism spread sensational lies about supposed maniacal Trump supporters in MAGA hats. They constructed fantasies that veritable white racists were now liberated to run amuck insulting and beating up people of color as they taunted the poor and victimized minorities with vicious Trump sloganeering – even as the Covington farce and now the even more embarrassing Jussie Smollett charade evaporated without apologies from the media and progressive merchants of such hate.”





During the 2016 election, “the Obama Department of Justice warped the Clinton email scandal investigation, from Bill Clinton’s secret meeting on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to unethical immunity given to the unveracious Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, to James Comey’s convoluted predetermined treatment of “likely winner” Clinton, and to DOJ’s Bruce Ohr’s flagrant conflict of interests in relation to Fusion GPS,” Hanson wrote.

“About a dozen FBI and DOJ grandees have now resigned, retired, been fired, or reassigned for unethical and likely illegal behavior – and yet have not faced criminal indictments. The reputation of the FBI as venerable agency is all but wrecked. Its administrators variously have libeled the Trump voters, expressed hatred for Trump, talked of “insurance policies” in ending the Trump candidacy, and inserted informants into the Trump campaign.

“The former Obama directors of the CIA and National Intelligence, with security clearances intact, hit the television airways as paid ‘consultants’ and almost daily accused the sitting president of Russian collusion and treason – without cross-examination or notice that both previously had lied under oath to Congress (and did so without subsequent legal exposure), and both were likely knee-deep in the dissemination of the Steele dossier among Obama administration officials.”

Hanson continued: “John Brennan’s CIA likely helped to spread the Fusion GPS dossier among elected and administrative state officials. Some in the NSC in massive and unprecedented fashion requested the unmasking of surveilled names of Trump subordinates, and then illegally leaked them to the press.

“The FISA courts, fairly or not, are now mostly discredited, given they either were willingly or naively hoodwinked by FBI and DOJ officials who submitted as chief evidence for surveillance on American citizens, an unverified dossier – without disclosure that the bought campaign hit-piece was paid for by Hillary Clinton, authored by a discredited has-been British agent, relied on murky purchased Russian sources, and used in circular fashion to seed news accounts of supposed Trump misbehavior.”

The “Crown Jewel” of the coup, Hanson noted, “was the appointment of special counsel Robert Muller to discover supposed 2016 Trump-Russian election collusion. Never has any special investigation been so ill-starred from its conception.”

Mueller’s team “soon discovered there was no Trump-Russian 2016 election collusion – and yet went ahead to leverage Trump campaign subordinates on process crimes in hopes of finding some culpability in Trump’s past 50-year business, legal, and tax records.”

While it has failed to prove “collusion,” the Mueller probe “succeeded brilliantly in two ways,” Hanson wrote.

“The ‘counterintelligence’ investigation subverted two years of the Trump presidency by constant leaks that Trump soon would be indicted, jailed, disgraced, or impeached. As a result, Trump’s stellar economic and foreign policy record would never earn fifty percent of public support.

“Second, Mueller’s pre-emptive attacks offered an effective offensive defense for the likely felonious behavior of John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Peter Strzok, and a host of others. While the Mueller lawyers threatened to destroy the lives of bit players like Jerome Corsi, George Papadopoulos, and Roger Stone, they de facto provided exemption to a host of the Washington hierarchy who had lied under oath, obstructed justice, illegally leaked to the press, unmasked and leaked names of surveilled Americans, and misled federal courts under the guise of a ‘higher loyalty’ to the cause of destroying Donald J. Trump.”

Hanson concluded: “Shame on all these failed conspirators and their abettors, and may these immoral people finally earn a long deserved legal and moral reckoning.”

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said Wednesday evening.Smollett is due in court in Chicago at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said CPD detectives will make contact with Smollett's legal team to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""Smollett is not in custody at this time. Guglielmi told ABC News police are not actively looking for the actor because ""this is not a violent crime,"" but said ""the longer this goes, the more we have to do what we have to do.""Guglielmi told ABC News police do not know where Smollett is, and ""his attorneys have not shared where he is at this point.""""I know this can be difficult emotionally, and we hope he doesn't do anything terrible. We want to make this as diplomatic as possible. In the end, this is only a class 4 felony. He will get through this and we want to make it as easy as possible for him to do it. But again, it is about accountability,"" Guglielmi told ABC News.Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said they have no comment at this time.Guglielmi said CPD detectives presented evidence before a Cook County grand jury Wednesday.Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement, saying, ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""Wednesday evening ABC7 Eyewitness News obtained surveillance video of the Osundairo brothers linked to the reported attack from a beauty supply shop. The video shows the brothers purchasing items possibly used in the case.Employees at Beauty House in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood said the brothers came to the business the day before the alleged attack. The store is a little more than a mile from their apartment, and a security guard said he remembers the siblings because they purchased ski masks.Chicago police confirmed the authenticity of the surveillance video, which shows the brothers purchasing numerous items, including a red ball cap, gloves, and ski masks.Security guard Montago Silas said he was asked by the siblings if the store sold ski masks, but the business did not have the traditional balaclava-type mask; they only carried the kind with separate eyeholes. He thought it strange that they purchased them.""It was bizarre because it was unusual for people to purchase these type of masks, not since the 70s, but I thought it was a little strange,"" Montago said.The surveillance video also shows them leaving the store. They get into a silver-colored two-door coupe before driving away. Hours later, Smollett reported the alleged attack.Montago said he's been keeping up with the Smollett story, but never thought he'd become a part of it.The video does not show the siblings buying the rope that Smollett says was placed around his neck. That item, according to sources, came from a hardware store.The attorney representing the Ousundairo brothers said her clients have been fully cooperating with the investigation and do not expect to be charged.Smollett reported on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw some type of chemical liquid on him, and looped a rope around his neck in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack. The pair were later identified as brothers and brought in for questioning.A law enforcement source said the brothers allege Smollett paid them to orchestrate and stage the attack. The brothers said Smollett was upset that the threatening letter sent to Empire's Chicago studios didn't get enough attention.Detectives are actively investigating the allegation, but have not confirmed it to be true, the official said.Wednesday Gugliemi confirmed prosecutors are speaking with Jussie Smollett's attorneys as part of their investigation into an alleged attack on the ""Empire"" actor.Guglielmi said he could not confirm reports that half a dozen subpoenas seeking Smollett's cell phone and bank records have been issued.""The only tool for detectives to be able to corroborate information is a search warrant and a subpoena. I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics, but it is not uncommon for any detective or law enforcement to subpoena records,"" Guglielmi said.Over the weekend Chicago police said they were ""eager"" to re-interview Smollett after releasing the two brothers without charges.The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the letter, which was sent to the Chicago studio for ""Empire"" on Jan. 22, and whether Smollett played a role in sending the letter, two federal officials confirmed to ABC News. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, according to one of those sources.Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the investigation surrounding the alleged attack on Smollett, her office told ABC News on Tuesday.""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" a spokeswoman told ABC News via email.Foxx clarified her reasons Wednesday. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office released a statement that explained: ""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State's Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident. Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State's Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.""Paperwork from the Illinois Board of Elections shows Vic Henderson, one of the attorneys representing Smollett, gave $250 to Foxx's campaign in 2016, but it was not related to the recusal.Former Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez criticized Foxx in a Facebook post Wednesday:""Maybe I should have just recused myself from the difficult cases that came across my desk when I was State's Attorney. I was under the impression that when the voters elected me and I took my oath of office it meant I had to do my job.""Alvarez lost the March 2016 Democratic primary to Foxx, after fallout from the Laquan McDonald shooting investigation.Last week, Smollett sat down with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts and spoke about the letter.""Just because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said, 'Smollett, Jussie, you will die, black (expletive),'"" Smollett said. ""There was no address, but the return address said in big, red, you know, like caps, 'MAGA.' Did I make that up too?""After the police department investigated Smollett's attack for weeks as a possible hate crime, they discovered that one of the brothers bought the rope to be used in the attack at a local hardware store.

And, it's pretty easy to understand why they'd be reluctant to cut him and his character from the show. Smollett has played Jamal Lyon since the drama began in 2015, and through five seasons he's been an important (and popular) part of the show. There's certainly enough on-screen drama to go around on Empire, and anyone familiar with night-time soaps will know that the genre is no stranger to writing even major characters out when the time is deemed right. The series is still relatively young, though, and the idea of getting rid of a big player right now is probably not something the producers and writers really want to contemplate, especially if it's not completely necessary."

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said Wednesday evening.Smollett is due in court in Chicago at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said CPD detectives will make contact with Smollett's legal team to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""Smollett is not in custody at this time.

We want to make this as diplomatic as possible. In the end, this is only a class 4 felony. He will get through this and we want to make it as easy as possible for him to do it. But again, it is about accountability,"" Guglielmi told ABC News.Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said they have no comment at this time.Guglielmi said CPD detectives presented evidence before a Cook County grand jury Wednesday.Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement, saying, ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""Wednesday evening ABC7 Eyewitness News obtained surveillance video of the Osundairo brothers linked to the reported attack from a beauty supply shop. The video shows the brothers purchasing items possibly used in the case.Employees at Beauty House in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood said the brothers came to the business the day before the alleged attack. The store is a little more than a mile from their apartment, and a security guard said he remembers the siblings because they purchased ski masks.Chicago police confirmed the authenticity of the surveillance video, which shows the brothers purchasing numerous items, including a red ball cap, gloves, and ski masks.Security guard Montago Silas said he was asked by the siblings if the store sold ski masks, but the business did not have the traditional balaclava-type mask; they only carried the kind with separate eyeholes. He thought it strange that they purchased them.""It was bizarre because it was unusual for people to purchase these type of masks, not since the 70s, but I thought it was a little strange,"" Montago said.The surveillance video also shows them leaving the store. They get into a silver-colored two-door coupe before driving away. Hours later, Smollett reported the alleged attack.Montago said he's been keeping up with the Smollett story, but never thought he'd become a part of it.The video does not show the siblings buying the rope that Smollett says was placed around his neck. That item, according to sources, came from a hardware store.The attorney representing the Ousundairo brothers said her clients have been fully cooperating with the investigation and do not expect to be charged.Smollett reported on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw some type of chemical liquid on him, and looped a rope around his neck in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.

While no charges have been filed against the actor yet, his case is set to go before a grand jury as early as this week.

Smollett is clearly gearing up for a legal battle, and he's reportedly hired famed defense attorney Mark Geragos, who's apparently planning to argue that Smollett is being framed by the Chicago Police Department.

Needless to say, Smollett's got a hard road ahead of him.

If the allegations against him prove to be accurate, then the best he can hope for is that he'll lose his career but retain his freedom.

The worst-case scenario for the actor is that he'll be sent to prison.

As new facts emerged about the case, Smollett lost support from several high-profile defenders -- but it seems he still has some powerful VIPs in his corner.

Earlier this week it was reported that Smollett would be fired from Empire.

On Tuesday, those reports were amended, and sources close to the show revealed that Smollett's role on the show has been dramatically reduced for the season's final two episodes with the goal of eventually cutting him loose.

Today, however, Fox issued a statement revealing that Smollett has not been fired and neither the network nor the producers of Empire have any intention of firing him anytime soon.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” the statement reads.

This is surprising news for a number of reasons.

With the show's ratings already declining over the past two seasons, the Smollett scandal could be the nail in the coffin for Empire.

While it makes sense that producers would wait until the police investigation to be completed before they would make a final decision on Smollett's future, it's puzzling that they would issue any statement at all about his role on the show.

We know that for the show's second-to-last episode of the season, Smollett's role has been reduced from nine scenes to four.

He was also scheduled to perform a song that has now been excised entirely.

The move represented a subtle compromise that would allow producers the option to gradually write Smollett out of the series.

Today's announcement is something of a bold move, as it might be interpreted by some as a sign that Smollett has his boss' wholesale support."

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” said 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment.

The statement comes as Chicago police seek to re-question Smollett after two brothers believed to have helped carry out the attack provided “new evidence” to detectives. The two men — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — were released from custody without charges after being picked up by police at O’Hare Internation airport upon returning from Nigeria.

Responding to reports that Smollett’s allegedly staged the attack after learning he was being written off Empire, Fox studios last Thursday issued a statement saying that idea he would no longer appear on the program was “patently ridiculous.”

“He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment stated.

However, TMZ reported Tuesday that the number of scenes Smollett was slated to appear in have been slashed. “Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d,” the Hollywood-focused outlet reported.

Smollett told police he was attacked in downtown Chicago while walking from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m on January 29. He said in addition to the bigoted slurs, his attackers also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” He also said they poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows that he pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence. Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court, records show. He later was charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Further, Chicago’s local CBS affiliate, WBBM Channel 2, reported Tuesday evening that Smollett allegedly “orchestrated” the assault on himself after the letter failed to garner a large enough reaction. According to ABC News, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether the actor was involved in the letter’s January 22 delivery. The letter, which contained powered aspirin and the phrase “Die black fag,” is currently undergoing tests at an FBI crime lab.

Fox 32 Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel, citing sources at the Chicago Police Department, tweeted Wednesday that an indictment of Smollett may come in “a matter of hours. Not days.”

Top attorney Mark Geragos has joined #JussieSmollett legal team. He is assisting Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. #CPD sources tell me an indictment of #Smollett could be coming in “a matter of hours. Not days”. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 20, 2019

Geragos recently represented former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his lawsuit against the professional football league.

The report comes as police are seeking to re-question Smollett amid allegations that he staged the attack with the brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — who were extras on Empire. According to CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar, Smollett directed one of the brothers to purchase the rope which was used in the alleged staged attack at the Crafty Beaver hardware store. De Mar also said Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 and promised an additional $500 later.

Smollett told police that two masked individuals had sprayed him with an unknown chemical substance as they hurled racist and anti-gay insults at him on January 29. The actor also claimed that his attackers had looped a thin rope around his neck and screamed “This is MAGA country!” before darting from the area.

Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Company, the network behind Empire, said in a statement Wednesday that Smollett is a “consulate profession” who will remain a regular on the show.

Not only is Smollett believed to have staged the assault, but may also be behind a threatening letter sent to him on the set of Empire.

Chicago’s local CBS affiliate, WBBM Channel 2, reported Tuesday evening that the actor “orchestrated” the assault after the letter failed to garner an adequate reaction.

FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service officials are currently probing whether he played a role in the letter’s January 22 delivery. The letter, which contained powered aspirin and the phrase “Die black fag,” is undergoing analysis at an FBI crime lab, ABC News reported.

In a statement to ABC News, Smollett’s lawyers said their client was “angered” and “further victimized” by claims that staged his own attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

The Instagram users have reported multiple issues on the platform. These include having their accounts automatically unfollow President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. without their knowledge or consent, and being prevented from liking posts from President Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and other conservative accounts.

Trump supporters on Instagram began contacting Don Jr. after the president’s son was temporarily blocked from posting about the Jussie Smollett hoax, an incident Instagram claimed was an error.

After this incident, Don Jr. posted a screenshot of a private message he received from a concerned Instagram user who said their account had automatically unfollowed the president’s son without their knowledge or consent.

Don Jr. subsequently received a barrage of private messages informing him of similar issues. Screenshots of these messages, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, can be seen below.

In an exclusive comment to Breitbart News, Donald Trump Jr. said:

We’ve known for some time that major social media companies have been engaged in an effort to suppress conservative views and free speech, but these latest revelations about Instagram’s behavior demonstrate an even more sinister sustained, coordinated, and targeted campaign at anyone and everyone who supports the president and conservative views. I fear we are just beginning to pull the mask back on just how insane these hidden but all-powerful censors really are, and it is frightening to know how much control they have over what people see online.

One of the most common issues reported by Instagram users is that they have been prevented from liking posts after interacting with posts from Don Jr, President Trump, or other conservative accounts.

Users sent their stories to Don Jr., along with screenshots of the messages they received from Instagram informing them of temporary liking blocks.

One user said she was blocked from liking content on Instagram after she posted about the Trump administration’s recent decision to fight the criminality of homosexuality around the world. Instagram recently faced controversy over LGBT rights abroad after an Indonesian LGBT comic strip disappeared from the platform following complaints from the Muslim Indonesian government.

Don Jr. drew attention to the liking-blocks in a post on Instagram today.

Another common issue being reported by Instagram users is that without their knowledge or consent, their accounts have automatically unfollowed Donald Trump Jr., President Trump, and other conservative accounts.

In a comment to Breitbart News, an Instagram spokeswoman said liking the President and Don Jr.’s posts could constitute “spammy behavior.”

“The ‘action blocked’ message is shown to people when we detect they may be taking part in spammy behavior, for example, liking multiple posts, following multiple accounts or similar. This is a measure we have in place to prevent spam on Instagram and isn’t specific to any one account.”

Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""Wednesday evening ABC7 Eyewitness News obtained surveillance video of the Osundairo brothers linked to the reported attack from a beauty supply shop. The video shows the brothers purchasing items possibly used in the case.Employees at Beauty House in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood said the brothers came to the business the day before the alleged attack. The store is a little more than a mile from their apartment, and a security guard said he remembers the siblings because they purchased ski masks.Chicago police confirmed the authenticity of the surveillance video, which shows the brothers purchasing numerous items, including a red ball cap, gloves, and ski masks.Security guard Montago Silas said he was asked by the siblings if the store sold ski masks, but the business did not have the traditional balaclava-type mask; they only carried the kind with separate eyeholes.

""There was no address, but the return address said in big, red, you know, like caps, 'MAGA.'

Fox Nation is taking a timely look back at the racially divisive and emotionally riveting saga of an African American teenager from New York who, in the 1980’s, falsely accused several white men of raping her. “Scandalous: The Mysterious Story of Tawana Brawley” is available now on the subscribers-only streaming network.

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

Brawley’s allegations from 1987 that she was raped by multiple men in the woods in Wappingers Falls, where she was left with racial slurs written on her body and wrapped in a plastic bag covered in feces, was later found to be nothing but a hoax. But in the months that transpired before the conclusion was reached by a grand jury in 1988, the community and even the nation were drawn into the dramatic saga that unfolded, complete with plot twists, protests and even the apparent launch of Al Sharpton’s career.

“We should have been upset by the fact that for a year or more this girl – and her advisers – had an entire community feeling like at any moment we were going to have some sort of civil war,” a Dutchess County attorney, Jonna Spilbor, said in the Fox Nation special.

According to Fox News:

“Scandalous: The Mysterious Story of Tawana Brawley” covers the entire story, from events leading up to the alleged incident to the defamation suit filed against Brawley and her attorneys by former Dutchess County prosecutor Steven Pagones — who had been falsely accused of raping the black teen. It will feature interviews with major players in the incident, including Attorney General Robert Abrams, who led the investigation — and goes into detail about some of the repercussions Brawley has faced.

Brawley’s allegations “were not corroborated by any of the facts,” Abrams said, citing a “meticulous investigation” that eventually brought the truth to light. But a heavy price was paid by many whose reputations suffered from the ordeal.

“Her father lost his job, her aunt lost her job with the state, they lived on I-95 for a few months,” Graham Weatherspoon, a retired New York Police Department detective, said in the special. “They were living out of their car driving up and down I-95. It was so bad that even their credit cards had been shut down.”

Ironically, Sharpton, who served as the teen’s adviser, did not seem to suffer any repercussions.

“That should’ve been the end of Al Sharpton’s career, yet just the opposite happened,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson noted during his monologue Monday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

“Sharpton has never apologized or even acknowledged the harm he did to this country by lying about Tawana Brawley. No one has forced him to. The lesson of Al Sharpton was clear to everyone watching: There are no penalties for hate hoaxes. There are only rewards.”

“Scandalous: The Mysterious Story of Tawana Brawley” i s available to view today on Fox Nation."

Smollett, 36, last month told police in Chicago that two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs had accosted him on the street and put a rope around his neck. Smollett, an openly gay African-American man, also plays a gay man on the show.

The news sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett's account when apparent inconsistencies began to surface.

ABC 7 Chicago last week quoted unnamed sources saying Smollett staged the attack to gain publicity because he was losing his role on ""Empire,"" a drama about a battle for control of a hip-hop musical empire.

But Chicago police said there was no evidence to support that report.

The company that produces the show issued a statement on Wednesday supporting Smollett. ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said.

Police have not found any surveillance video of the reported attack, which they said was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Detectives last week questioned two unnamed men identified from surveillance camera footage showing two people walking on a sidewalk near where Smollett said he was assaulted. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Friday the two were released without being charged.

The case took another turn on Tuesday after Chicago police began investigating a tip that Smollett was seen inside his apartment building with the two men who were being questioned. Guglielmi later said the tip was ""unfounded"" and not supported by video evidence.

Guglielmi said on Sunday detectives were attempting to speak with Smollett again to follow up on his initial report of an attack on Jan. 29.

In an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might stem from racial bias."

Noah was talking about the Jussie Smollett hate hoax and how so many people jumped on that story as true despite huge holes in his fable because it confirmed their biases.

I don't know what the details of the Jussie Smollett story are going to end up being. What I do know is right now the story just doesn't make sense in the pieces that it's laid out as, right? Like I'm not saying that he is lying, I'm just saying that his story doesn't seem to line up with what's happening cuz these guys admitted to punching him so that part of the story is now effectively dead, right? You can't look for people when they said yes we have the guys that punched him. Now the story is gonna be did you pay them to punch you or not.

And from some reports the guys that were paid to punch him also claim that the hate letter sent to Smollett was also a hoax. Oh, and Trevor, I think it is now safe to say that Smollett was lying.

Are they part of it or not? And then it has to be like well then why did they do this to you just randomly. Like what two Nigerian guys walking around in Chicago's freezing weather and then shouting this is MAGA country. Like so weird things a shot as a Nigerian person this is like a strange...

Funny stuff but then Noah switched gears and got serious.

If I was Trump this is a home run in my world because so many people jumped on board before they even like wait to see what it was about. ...We live in a world where people are too enthusiastic at jumping at stories that confirm their biases and instead of that confirm their biases instead of just pausing and going what do I make of the story what do I make of this story on my own volition. Forget your political anythings, you know, this is like what does it confirm your biases?

(The full video can be found here.) Good advice for anybody but especially for the MSM. Oh, and Noah's advice should apply not only to the Jussie Smollett hate hoax but for a plethora of other similar stories such as the Covington Catholic high school students incident which took place just before. It applies equally as well as in many other instances when the MSM jumped the gun and assumed guilt due to political biases such as in the Duke Lacrosse case or when blaming a University of Virginia fraternity for a rape that did not happen.

Exit question: How long will it be before another hate hoax appears that the MSM jumps upon without thinking again?"

Top attorney Mark Geragos has joined #JussieSmollett legal team. He is assisting Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson. #CPD sources tell me an indictment of #Smollett could be coming in “a matter of hours. Not days”. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 20, 2019

Word that Smollett was talking to Geragos was reported yesterday by CBS Chicago reporter Brad Edwards. So the bigger news here (from Weigel) may be that an indictment could be imminent. As Ed noted earlier today, the Nigerian brothers who are now cooperating with police were set to give testimony before a grand jury yesterday. CBS This Morning reported they were actually waiting to go into the grand jury hearing room when Smollett’s lawyers called. Suddenly the testimony was called off. It’s not clear if that was because Smollett’s team offered them something (they’ve been looking to hold a follow-up interview with him) or for some other reason. In any case, if Weigel’s report is correct then the indictment is still coming. If that news breaks I’ll update this story below.

Meanwhile, the Atlantic has published a pretty insightful, and in this climate also brave, piece by Columbia University professor John McWhorter. McWhorter says repeatedly that the story isn’t over yet and could take another turn but if it turns out Smollett did stage this attack as the brothers claim, what does that say about him and American society in general. He calls this “victimhood chic”:

Until this twist, smart people were claiming that the attack on Smollett was the story of Donald Trump’s America writ small—that it revealed the terrible plight of minority groups today. But the Smollett story, if the “trajectory” leads to evidence of fakery, would actually reveal something else modern America is about: victimhood chic. Future historians and anthropologists will find this aspect of early-21st-century America peculiar, intriguing, and sad. Smollett doesn’t need the money he would get from a court settlement, and he isn’t trying to deny someone higher office. So why in the world would he fake something like that attack—if he did indeed fake it? The reason might be that he has come of age in an era when nothing he could have done or said would have made him look more interesting than being attacked on the basis of his color and sexual orientation. Racial politics today have become a kind of religion in which whites grapple with the original sin of privilege, converts tar questioners of the orthodoxy as “problematic” blasphemers, and everyone looks forward to a judgment day when America “comes to terms” with race. Smollett—if he really did stage the attack—would have been acting out the black-American component in this eschatological configuration, the role of victim as a form of status. We are, within this hierarchy, persecuted prophets, ever attesting to the harm that white racism does to us and pointing to a future context in which our persecutors will be redeemed of the sin of having leveled that harm upon us. We are noble in our suffering.

It doesn’t surprise me that in the age of intersectionality, where the more oppressed you are the more your voice needs to be amplified, someone would see an advantage in acting out that oppression. In fact, that seems to me to be the case in dozens of other fake hate crimes reported and then busted over the past few years. If you believe you’re oppressed, you naturally want others to believe that too even if you have to stage the proof yourself.

For Smollett, being a successful actor and singer might not have been quite as exciting as being a poster child for racist abuse in Trump’s America. Assuming, again, that the reports are accurate, Smollett’s clumsiness would be an especially poignant indication of how deeply this victimhood chic has taken hold—almost as if he thought this was such an easy score that he didn’t even need to think too hard about the logistics.

If the reports are true that Smollett himself planned the attack because the hate letter (which he may also have fabricated) didn’t make a big enough splash, that’s pretty telling about what he was looking for. Remember Cuba Gooding Jr.’s character telling Tom Cruise’s Jerry Maguire in the film of the same name that he wanted the “Quan”? The idea was that there’s a level of celebrity above money and minor fame. There’s a level where it becomes love and respect. Doesn’t it seem entirely possible that Smollett thought this was his path to the Quan? Put it this way, if he did stage this and didn’t get caught, would he be more famous and respected now especially on the left? There’s no doubt the answer is yes. And McWhorter closes by suggesting that says something about where we really are today in terms of race relations:

Only in an America in which matters of race are not as utterly irredeemable as we are often told could things get to the point that someone would pretend to be tortured in this way, acting oppression rather than suffering it, seeking to play a prophet out of a sense that playing a singer on television is not as glamorous as getting beaten up by white guys. That anyone could feel this way and act on it in the public sphere is, in a twisted way, a kind of privilege, and a sign that we have come further on race than we are often comfortable admitting.

I suspect McWhorter is going to face some serious backlash over this. It’s just not the kind of thing you’re supposed to say even if it rings true. And again, that’s true regardless of how the Smollett case turns out because there are lots of other examples."

In late January 2019, Empire actor Jussie Smollett went for a 2 a.m. Subway sandwich run that turned absolutely traumatic when he became the alleged victim of a brutal hate crime. According to TMZ, the star was hospitalized after what he claimed was an attack by two masked men who beat him up, placed a noose around his neck and doused him in what was later determined to be bleach. They also reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the star, who is black and openly gay, while referencing Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" catchphrase.

According to Vox, Chicago police were ""treating the incident as a possible hate crime"" from the start. Following the initial reports, the actor received an outpouring of support from his fellow Empire co-stars, Hollywood A-listers and prominent politicians — from Ariana Grande to Nancy Pelosi. Then, the narrative shifted, and so did the celebrity hot takes.

In the following weeks, a number of reports claimed police were investigating whether or not Smollett paid off two men to orchestrate his attack — brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, who have professional ties to Smollett. Smollett lawyered up and denied that the attack was staged, but was later arrested and charged with ""disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report,"" according to CNN. Naturally, Hollywood had mixed feelings about this whole stranger-than-fiction scenario."

Smollett, 36, plays Jamal Lyon, the son of music mogul Lucious Lyon on ""Empire,"" which is in its fifth season and returns to the air March 13.

The actor, who is black and gay, told Chicago police he was beaten Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him as he was out getting food in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville. He also said the men put a noose around his neck and poured what he said was bleach on him.

Police investigated the alleged assault as a possible hate crime and last week arrested Ola and Abel Osundairo, who are brothers, in connection with the reported attack.

Police released the two men Friday without charges. They are no longer suspects in the case, police said, adding that after questioning the brothers, the investigation into the attack ""had shifted.""

Authorities are now looking at whether Smollett allegedly paid the two men to stage an assault, a police source familiar with the investigation told NBC News on Saturday. Police have requested another interview with the actor.

Smollett's attorneys have strongly denied any suggestion that the actor was complicit.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" the attorneys said."

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

The New York Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a written statement.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces “Empire,” declined comment when told earlier on Wednesday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

‘MAGA COUNTRY’

Smollett has stood by his account even as police failed to find any evidence of an assault and suspicions grew on social media that it was a hoax.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognized from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

TV station CBS Chicago on Wednesday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

The ruling issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff involves records tied to internal investigations into police-involved shootings, severe uses of force and confirmed cases of sexual assault, the Times reported.

It comes as a blow to the Los Angeles Police Protective League, a police union that sought to protect the confidentiality of records tied to older incidents. Until last year, California had the nation’s most stringent law protecting police records, according to the Times.

Beckloff’s decision comes about as a result of a case that included the Los Angeles Times, other news organizations and legal advocacy organizations.

“It’s a clear rejection of the core legal argument that police unions have been relying on for weeks now,” David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, told the news organization. “We are confident that as the courts continue to confront the unions’ tortured legal arguments, they will come down on the side of transparency and accountability.”

The league is among several unions in California that have sought legal redress to block the release of records from older incidents, according to the Times.

Jacob Kalinski, a lawyer for the league and for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, told the news organization that officer privacy is akin to attorney-client privilege. As an example, he said that it would be a problem if comments that clients made to their lawyers under the understanding that it would be private suddenly became public because of a change in the law.

The lawyer also said that police officers charged with wrongdoing made impactful decisions about whether to appeal their discipline based on their understanding that the details of their cases would always remain private, the Times reported."

According to The Blast, though the sit down with host Robin Roberts may have touched some people when it was broadcast on the show, some people actually present during the taping felt Smollett’s credibility was still “up in the air” after his conversation with Roberts.

The unnamed sources say once Smollett and his team left the premises, there was a palpable feeling of unease among the GMA staffers, with some voicing that something about the story felt off.

Many media outlets wanted to get the first interview after the alleged attack, but Smollett approached the morning show about doing the sit-down, and specifically requested Robin Roberts because the two had a history together. In April of 2018 Roberts made a cameo on an episode of Empire in which she played herself.

In light of new developments and increasing speculation about the story being a hoax, Monday, Roberts addressed the controversy about her interview with Smollett stating, “When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened.

“And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative,” she continued. “This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

As for motive, according to a report out of Chicago, authorities now believe that a week before the alleged attack Smollett was upset about the lack of reaction to a threatening letter he received at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where his show is filmed.

The outlet quoted a source as saying, “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.”

The change comes amid media reports suggesting actor Jussie Smollett falsely claimed a group of men assaulted him one night in Chicago.

“Content claiming that specific victims of public violent incidents or their next of kin are actors, or that their experiences are false,” notes a bullet point on YouTube’s page fleshing out the company’s policies on harassment and cyberbullying. The language is an example of the kind of content the platform does not permit, according to Google.

Google, YouTube’s parent company, told The Daily Caller News Foundation that YouTube launched an update Tuesday to the company’s Community Guidelines strike system that gave users a warning of a violation before getting a strike. The previous system gave users who violated such guidelines a three-strike count without a warning before having the platforms removed.

Google has not responded to TheDCNF’s request for comment about how the newest guideline will be administered in situations where the outcomes are in doubt. Smollett reported in January that two men assaulted him and yelled, “This is [Make America Great Again] country,” at him. (RELATED: Vox Correspondent Says ‘MAGA Country’ Quote In Smollett Case Was Pushed By Celebrities Not The Media)

Various pundits and media-types criticized the actor’s contention, claiming that Smollett’s report contained numerous holes. Law official sources reported the case could be headed to a grand jury sometime this week. Law enforcement is determining if Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to help him stage the attack.

The new guideline might also address instances when people use YouTube’s platform to post videos expressing doubt about the nature of a public shooting. An example of that happened when media provocateur Alex Jones concocted conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut. Jones aired an episode on his podcast claiming CNN used several green screens to cover the shooting’s aftermath.

YouTube’s policy shift comes a year after TheDCNF reported in February 2018 that Southern Poverty Law Center assisted the company in policing content on its platform. The left-wing nonprofit is one of the more than 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government agencies in YouTube’s “Trusted Flaggers” program, a source with knowledge of the arrangement told TheDCNF at the time.

TMZ says brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, accused of helping Smollett stage the attack, were in a Chicago courthouse Tuesday ready to testify for the grand jury. But shortly before the Osundairos took the stand, Smollett or his legal team called prosecutors to inform them the actor/singer was ready to cooperate with police. The brothers' testimonies were ultimately postponed, meaning Smollett may have dodged an indictment for filing a false police report.

According to the outlet, the grand jury did not convene Wednesday morning as expected. The meeting between Smollett and Chicago law enforcement has yet to happen.

The 36-year-old claims to have been a victim of a racist, homophobic attack. Smollett told police two masked men assaulted him at around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in the streets of Chicago. The Empire star claimed the culprits poured a substance on him, tied a noose around his neck, and shouted racist, homophobic slurs at him before stating ""this is MAGA country.""

Ola and Abel were taken in last week in connection with the attack, but were released without any charges. The Osundairos, who also appeared on Empire, reportedly told authorities Smollett paid them over $3,000 to stage the attack just a day before the brothers traveled to Nigeria. Sources told TMZ the Africa trip had been planned before Smollett's supposed offer.

There were other reported details about the case that raised suspicion, such as Smollett's alleged refusal to speak to police after the Osundairos' time with the police, and redacted phone records he provided to authorities. Smollett appeared on Good Morning America last week to share his side of the story and to address critics who questioned the legitimacy of his account.

""At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s because it's the truth,"" he told Robin Roberts. ""Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.""

As the investigation into Jussie Smollett‘s apparent hate crime continues to raise questions, Empire is standing behind the actor.

In a new statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment tell PEOPLE: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

The statement comes after reports emerged last week claiming detectives are reviewing whether Smollett, who is black and gay, orchestrated the attack on himself.

In response to the speculation that the actor — who has played Jamal Lyon on the Fox show since 2015 — staged his attack in a bid to keep his job, Fox denied that his character was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the network said in a statement on Feb. 14. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

At the time, Chicago PD also shot down the reports, saying “media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Smollett reported being involved in a “racially-charged assault and battery” at around 2 a.m. on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29.

Last week, brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo — identified in surveillance footage on the night of the incident — were arrested and released without charges. The following day, reports emerged that the brothers claimed the Empire star paid them to stage the incident.

Chicago PD refused to comment on the speculation that the attack was a hoax but acknowledged that the investigation has “shifted.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

In another statement, Guglielmi said the department was “not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released,” but said “there are some developments in this investigation” and “detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

Smollett denied the allegations in a statement released by his attorneys: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

Filing a false police report in Illinois is a Class 4 felony, punishable by one to three years in prison and fines of up to $25,000, according to Illinois statutes.

If Empire actor Jussie Smollet did actually make a false police report about allegedly being attacked last month, justice demands that he be prosecuted.

As Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass points out in a superb column, Smollett's allegation diverted huge resources, including two dozen detectives, that could have been used to, say, investigate who shot a 1-year-old child in the head.

But who should give a damn about an infant getting shot when political correctness, fueled by bigoted politicians and irresponsible media, set off national finger-pointing and self-righteous scolding by left-wing and LGBT radicals?

Who among Democrats who hold just about all the relevant elective and law-enforcement offices in Chicago, Cook County and Illinois will go after Smollett to ""the full extent of the law?""

There's talk of a grand jury inquiry into Smollett's claims that racist and homophobic supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the TV star. But considering the secrecy of grand juries and how easily they can be manipulated, can we count on them doing their job when it comes to nailing someone who is a national idol who got so much national sympathy because its the left's narrative that anyone on the other side is automatically evil?

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx is the leading prosecutor in Cook County and should lead the investigation. But she has officially recused herself from the case, and failed to give a reason other than the vague ""familiarity with potential witnesses in the case."" That leaves us to supply a reason: She's afraid. What will happen to her political career if the left targets her for indicting or even convicting Smollett? She has appointed Joseph Magats, a career assistant state's attorney to handle the case who'll take the heat.

So, who else? Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is the state' chief law enforcement officer. But he's too busy feathering his political nest by challenging the sentence of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke for the murder of a black teenager.

Illinois' new Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Rahm Emanuel could use their bully pulpits to demand justice. Or some off the 14 Chicago mayoral candidates could make it an issue. Other public officials could chime in.

I won't hold my breath.

In the unlikely event that Smollett is indicted and convicted there's always this: Probation. It's entirely up to the judge who can consider such things as previous criminal history. The maximum length of probation is up to 30 months.

Or more likely, a plea deal that will save everyone embarrassment.

So, unless I'm overlooking another, more serious charge that can be brought against Smollett, punishment for discrediting his own cause, tarring Chicago's reputation and diverting scarce and costly Chicago police resources from more important cases, the maximum he can receive is a slap on the wrist.

Smollett, a gay, black actor on the TV show “Empire,” falsely claimed that he was attacked by two Donald Trump-loving rednecks on the mean streets of Chicago. Smollett said that he was out in the middle of the night in Chicago, purchasing a Subway sandwich, when two men who recognized him from “Empire” began to call him a “f—–” and a “n—–.” They then looped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him while shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

There were a few problems with this story. First, Trump fans are not exactly the chief demographic for “Empire” (Nielsen estimates the show’s audience is 61 percent black). Second, Chicago is not exactly MAGA (Make America Great Again) country — only 12.5 percent of votes cast for president in 2016 went to Trump. Third, Smollett never lost control of his sandwich. Fourth, Smollett then waited 40 minutes to report the attack. Fifth, when the police asked for his phone to verify his claim that his manager had heard the attack, he refused.

Nonetheless, the Smollett attack dominated media coverage for weeks, with Smollett appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America” to castigate his doubters as racists. Actress Ellen Page told Stephen Colbert’s late-night talk-show audience that the attack was Mike Pence’s fault. CNN’s Brooke Baldwin lamented, “This is America in 2019.”

Except it wasn’t. Smollett, it turned out, allegedly paid two of his friends to stage the attack. Smollett’s story, then, was false. The media allowed it to flower — and propped up Smollett’s claims that doubters were bigots — because it fit their narrative of America as deeply racist and homophobic in the era of Donald Trump. Even after the story fell apart, commentator Liz Plank of Vox appeared on CNN to explain, “There has been an increase in hate crimes against the LGBTQ community, against Muslims, against black people.”

Plank did not mention the group most bedeviled by an increase in reported hate crimes: Jews. Reported hate crime incidents and offenses against blacks rose between 2016 and 2017 approximately 13 percent; against LGBTQ people, 4 percent; against Muslims, 17 percent; against Jews, 26 percent. On a per capita basis, Jews are by far the most targeted group in the United States, about four times as likely to be targeted as black Americans, and twice as likely as LGBTQ Americans and Muslim Americans.

“The media care more about hate crimes that fit their narrative.”

Last weekend, the front window of the Chabad of Bushwick (N.Y.) was smashed, even as the rabbi and his wife and children slept there for Shabbat. This is hardly the only recent attack in Gotham. According to The New York Times, “there have been four times as many crimes motivated by bias against Jews — 142 in all — as there have against blacks. Hate crimes against Jews have outnumbered hate crimes targeted at transgender people by a factor of 20.”

Why, then, has this spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes received so little coverage? The New York Times admitted: “it is to some extent because it refuses to conform to an easy narrative with a single ideological enemy. During the past 22 months, not one person caught or identified as the aggressor in an anti-Semitic hate crime [in New York City] has been associated with a far right-wing group.”

In other words, the media care more about hate crimes when the perpetrators are white and when the victims aren’t. They care more about hate crimes that fit their narrative. And hate crimes against Jews don’t count as much, particularly when those hate crimes aren’t driven by white supremacy.

Why not? Why wouldn’t the left-wing media be interested in a narrative about an increasingly anti-Semitic America in the same way they’re fascinated by narratives about an increasingly racist, Islamophobic and homophobic America? Because Jews in America are successful financially and educationally; because, generally speaking, the notion that America is anti-Semitic is absurd. Everyone understands that America is ridiculously philo-Semitic. So if the Jews aren’t generally hate crime victims, what are we to make of the fact that every other group is targeted less often than Jews? Better to ignore anti-Semitism than to admit that perhaps America is incredibly tolerant and diverse.

Better for the narrative to prevail than the truth: that despite the presence of evil bigots in our midst, America is a pretty fantastic place.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier today, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained today that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

The Southern Poverty Law Center recently released its annual Year in Hate and Extremism report, finding an increase in hate groups for the fourth year in a row. The findings revealed a 30 percent increase in American bias-motivated groups in just four years and a 7 percent increase in 2018 alone — a record high during 20 years of tracking.

The group argues that this historic trend is related to President Donald Trump, the usage of social media to spread hate messages, and what they call “hysteria” from white Americans fearful of demographic changes that have led to a more racially diverse nation.

""The numbers tell a striking story — that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,"" Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said in a statement. ""Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as president of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it — with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to to act on their worst instincts.""

The Southern Poverty Law Center defines a ""hate group"" as an organization that ""based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities — has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people typically for their race, religion, ethnicity sexual orientation or gender identity.""

They found 1,020 organization in just the last year that meet this definition of hate.

Groups most commonly tracked by the organization are mostly white supremacist groups that include neo-Nazis, followers of the Ku Klux Klan, and skinheads. However, the group also noted in the report that black nationalist groups are rising and “growing their ranks.”

While black nationalist groups echo many of the same anti-Semitic or anti-LGBTQ beliefs held by white supremacist groups, they do not currently sway mainstream politics in the ways these groups have been able to in recent years under President Trump, according to the report.

The organization report arrives at a moment where hate crimes and hate-motivated attacks are garnering huge national attention in the media due to the recent alleged hate crime reported by gay, African-American actor Jussie Smollett.

Last month, the star of Empire reported that he was attacked by two white men at 2 a.m. in Chicago while walking home from a Subway restaurant. The men allegedly yelled racist and homophobic epithets while attacking him and eventually put a noose around his neck.

Recent reports that claim Smollett was involved in coordinating the attack have begun to sway public support the actor first received. Some powerful members of government like Sens. Kamala Harris and Corey Booker, who have used his story to pass anti-lynching legislation in the Senate, are now silencing their unwavering support of his accounts as police continue to investigate.

No charges in his case have been made and the actor is still considered a victim of the alleged crime, which occured as the U.S. also sees an increase in reports of hate crimes, alongside more hate groups.

The purpose of this was to have video footage that the media would play up nationwide, fomenting an outbreak of racially-charged violence that would ultimately lead to a full-blown race war across America (which the media, of course, would blame on Trump).

This is the goal of the left-wing media, which now functions as a cabal of enemy combatants in a civil war they started. And I have no doubt that Barack Obama and his “community organizers” are behind the whole thing. Smollett is well known to be a cohort of Obama, and this is exactly the kind of thing Obama continues to direct from his “bunker” command center near the White House. (See photo, below, of Smollett and the Obamas together.)

The independent media blow the hoax wide open (and the Chicago police did a damn fine job, too)

Yet the hoax was revealed thanks to the efforts of the independent media and old school police work by the Chicago PD, not the “mainstream” media news cartels (which pushed endless lies and propaganda to prop up the hoax for as long as possible).

It was indy media that asked the first questions about the flimsy story that Smollett pushed on the world. Too many things didn’t add up, and while the left-wing media swallowed the hoax without asking a single critical question, the independent media pointed out the many holes in Smollett’s story, such as the fact that he refused to hand over his full phone records to the police… or his claim that he was attacked by two men but somehow managed to hold on to his Subway sandwich the entire time, even walking home with it. Other facts highlighted by the independent media also blew holes in the Smollett story, such as the observation that Smollett was spotted on camera walking home with the fake noose still around his neck. Why would a victim of an attempted lynching continue to wear the noose? And why would he wait 40 minutes to call the police? Why didn’t he desperately shout to the doorman of his apartment to call the police, explaining he had just been attacked?

None of it added up. But the left-wing media didn’t care. The fake hate crime hoax fit their narrative of America as a racist nation filled with homophobic Trump supporters, and the delicious ingredients in that recipe made such an enticing narrative that the media couldn’t resist. So they risked a race war breaking out across America to try to once again demonize Trump supporters and “keep the hate alive” (which is a key job of the left-wing media these days).

America was just saved by the same independent media that the tech giants are trying to wipe out

All this underscores the importance of speech diversity in a free society. Dissenting voices are sometimes the most important voices of all, since they question the official narrative of lies and deception. This is exactly why systematic censorship of the independent media by the dishonest, fascist tech giants is so dangerous to Democracy.

In this case, it was the dissenting voices — the independent media — that exposed the hoax and very likely stopped the outbreak of racial violence from taking place. In other words, while the mainstream media was actively pushing for a race war in America, the independent media threw water on the embers before it become a firestorm. In response, numerous “journalists” in the media are publicly admitting they are disappointed and saddened that the hate crime wasn’t real. They actually wish for hate crime violence in America, and they don’t even try to hide their dark desires anymore.

Yes, we’ve actually reached the point of insanity in America where “mainstream” media journalists actively wish for hate crimes and race wars. And they are willing to lie and deceive the public to try to make that happen.

If anyone should be censored and de-platformed today it’s CNN, the NYT and the Washington Post. Those are the organizations spreading dangerous lies in a deliberate effort to spark a nationwide race war. They are complicit in the plot to destroy America, and they are acting with extreme malice in trying to carry out their intended agendas to see America rip itself apart.

So why do the tech giants selectively censor the independent media while granting the lying left-wing media near-total control over the public narrative? Because the tech giants want to destroy America, too. They’re all in on it. It’s a plot to bring down this nation, blame white people, depose Trump, silence all dissent and sweep in an authoritarian regime run by deranged, fraudulent Leftists.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said.

The new statement comes after reports surfaced Tuesday that Smollet had his role cut back in the episode of the Fox series that is currently being filmed.

Smollet faces claims that he staged an assault on himself in Chicago late last month in what was described as a suspected hate crime. The actor and musician stated that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck. It was also reported the two men used the phrase “MAGA country” during the attack, a reference to President Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Since then, the Chicago police have begun investigating whether or not Smollett paid brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to stage the attack. Police previously arrested the brothers but they were later released without being charged.

Smollett and his representatives have repeatedly denied that he staged the attack.

As Variety reported on Tuesday, Smollett would face charges of falsifying a police report, a Class 4 felony in Illinois, should his story prove to be false.

America’s Grievance Machine

It is not much of a secret that in America we have a well-funded grievance machine. It is funded by CAIR, The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Democrat party and the liberal media.

And they get away with it. Not with the lies, those are always revealed in the brightness of the light. But in their constant march to create racial division through lies. Remember Ferguson and the national outrage based on a lie? (‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ was built on a lie) That lie leading to the destruction of the career of a Police Officer, Darren Wilson.

The Washington Post on Ferguson

“What DOJ found made me ill. Wilson knew about the theft of the cigarillos from the convenience store and had a description of the suspects. Brown fought with the officer and tried to take his gun. And the popular hands-up storyline, which isn’t corroborated by ballistic and DNA evidence and multiple witness statements, was perpetuated by Witness 101. In fact, just about everything said to the media by Witness 101, whom we all know as Dorian Johnson, the friend with Brown that day, was not supported by the evidence and other witness statements.”

Tawan Brawley launches race agitator Al Sharpton’s career

In 1987 Tawana Brawley, an African-American 15-year-old teen falsely accuses four white men of raping her. The charges receive widespread national attention because of her age and that she accuses a police officer and a prosecuting attorney of the crime.

Adding fuel to the fire, Brawley was found in a garbage bag, with racial slurs written on her body. And feces in her hair. It was hard to imagine that this was a hoax because of her condition.

Starting a decades trend of making false claims of hate crimes, Brawley’s advisers Al Sharpton, Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason all come out to vocally condemn the men accused by Brawley creating racial controversy. Sharpton led the charge that the state was covering up the crime because the accused were white.

Brawley Grand Jury

In October 1988, after hearing from 180 witnesses, reviewing 250 exhibits and recording more than 6,000 pages of testimony the Grand Jury found that Brawley had not been the victim of a forcible sexual assault.

Despite that evidence that Brawley had perpetrated a hate crime hoax, the teen was still defended. Patricia J. Williams, a proponent of critical race theory that says race is the fundamental determinant of the American legal system wrote that the teenager:





“Has been the victim of some unspeakable crime. No matter how she got there. No matter who did it to her—and even if she did it to herself.”

If Ford’s attacker was not Kavanaugh it was someone and he should pay the price

A sentiment we heard applied to both Christine Blasey Ford who falsely accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh and to Jussie Smollett.

“The #MeToo movement is terribly compelling, but I’m not someone who thinks every accusation is true,” said Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge who teaches at Harvard Law said at the time of the testimony. “I also don’t believe every accusation is false. So I could not say from [prior] press accounts, ‘oh, I believe it.’ But after today, I can say that.”

Gertner also said:

Gertner said the science around trauma shows that it sometimes “obfuscates your memory, and sometimes trauma enhances it. The clarity of her testimony and her effect make it clearer to me that this was seared into her memory.”

The Christine Blasey Ford hate crime hoax

However, it was clear to any thinking person that the lack of corroboration from those Ford identified as being able to corroborate her account, that her accusations were at best a lie, at worse a hoax perpetrated by Senator Dianne Feinstein and the liberal body.

Liberals never pay the price

Now the Covington Student, Nick Sandmann is suing the Washington Post for their attacks and false reporting, i.e., libel, against the student. And he is suing big. $250,000,000 big.

If you forget the story, the media and social media warriors lost their collective minds over this video:

Only this was just a brief glimpse of the encounter and only told one aspect of a bifurcated moment. Sandmann’s libel lawyer, L Linn Wood, releases this 15-minute capsulization of what really happened beneath the gaze of Honest Abe.

Why is this happening?

As Joy Behar says in a rare moment of truth, we do this because “we are desperate to get Trump out of office.”

While Trump Derangement Syndrome is the catalyst behind the more recent hoaxes (see below), they are nothing new.

In the late 1980’s Morton Downey Jr. falsely claims to be attacked by neo-Nazis.

The Duke University lacrosse team is falsely accused of attacking an African-American exotic dancer. A gay man falsely accuses Whole Foods of decorating his cake with the slur, “fag.”

We should also remember a recent video of a child being separated from his mother at the border that turned out to be a hoax. The Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation battle likewise had its share of hoaxes, if not out and out lies.

Such hoaxes are overwhelmingly common and tiresome.

The Federalist (15 Recent Hate Crime Hoaxes That Might Make You Suspect There’s A Trend) offers just 15 of the many hoaxes from the recent path. Please note, the Federalist gives credit to the writers who helped compile this list here, here, here, and here.

November 2016

A pro-gay Indiana church was vandalized with slurs, including one reading, “Heil Trump.” It was actually the church’s own organ player who did it as a hoax.

Firefighters battled arson at a church attended by African Americans. On the wall of the church, the presumed arsonist wrote, “Vote Trump,” in an apparent reference to the upcoming election. It was a sick hoax perpetrated by one of the parishioners.

In Lafayette, Kentucky, a woman falsely claimed to have had her hijab stolen by white men wearing Trump hats.

December 2016

A Plainview, New York man was charged with perpetrating another vandalism hoax in which he painted several swastikas around the campus of Nassau Community College.

A Muslim woman made up another hijab-stealing hate crime hoax, claiming three men screaming “Donald Trump” attacked her.

April 2017:

An arson case in Charlotte, North Carolina first appeared to be a hate crime when the perpetrator left a note reading, “Our newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for White America. You all know that, we want our country back on the right track. We need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and all immigrants.” It was a hoax.

May 2017:

A racist note left on the windshield of an African-American St. Olaf student touched off campus-wide protests and got the college to cancel classes. It was a hoax perpetrated as “strategy to draw attention to concerns about the campus climate.”

November 2017:

A Kansas man defaced his own car with racist slogans. Police soon concluded this to be another vandalism hoax.

December 2017:

The U.S. Justice Department announces the conviction of Juan Thompson, a reporter for The Intercept, for making hoax bomb threats to Jewish community centers.

September 2018:

A Long Island, New York woman falsely claims to have been accosted by mysterious Trump supporters screaming “Trump 2016” and to have received a threatening note and gotten her tire slashed.

October 2018:

Vandalism at a Brooklyn synagogue originally believed to the work of an anti-Semitic vandal turned out to be the work of a black man with career experience as an “anti-hate” worker for City Hall.

Republican’s history of not fighting back

Why do liberals and liberal media continue to create hoaxes for political gain? Is it just to embarrass conservatives? Or some odd need for 15-minutes of fame? Is it a matter of throwing enough lies against the wall, until something sticks?

Probably a combination of all of the above. But the underlying reason for this is the left’s desire to gain political power. As they have continually failed as a ruling class, they attempt to create engagement within their base by creating outrage. From Al Sharpton who launched a career as a professional race agitator to Senator Dianne Feinstein’s culpability in the Kavanaugh debacle, Conservatives, and the Republican party, just move forward.

Confident that the facts will bear out the truth. And to the liberal and Democrat dismay, they do.

But those in the Democrat party and the liberal media are never taken to task for their actions.

For the division and racial tension that the purposely cause among Americans. Nancy Pelosi is not chattering about the immorality of race-baiting lying by liberals and the liberal media.

The fact that Christine Blasey Ford profited over $850,000 as a result of her accusations against Kavanaugh is all you need to know about just how unfair the scales of Justice are balanced when it comes to hate hoax crimes. Kavanaugh, because he is a conservative on the Supreme Court has not filed libel suits against Ford, or his other accuser Jodi Sweetnick or her lawyer Avanatti.

Until now.

Covington Highschool Junior Nick Sandmann takes on Jeff Bezos

Like a modern-day David and Goliath tale, Nick Sandmann is suing the Washington Post-owned by Jeff Bezos for $250,000 million.

“Today, Lin Wood and Todd McMurtry filed their first lawsuit on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann against The Washington Post,” Sandmann’s lawyers say in a statement. The suit seeks $250 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Lin and Todd will continue to bring wrongdoers before the court to seek damages in compensation for the harm so many have done to the Sandmann family. This is only the beginning.”

The lawsuit accuses The Washington Post of targeting Sandmann “because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red ‘Make America Great Again’ souvenir cap. Sandmann was on a school field trip when Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist, approaches the teen beating a drum in his face while chanting loudly. Phillips is the aggressor.

According to the suit:

“In targeting and bullying Nicholas by falsely accusing him of instigating the January 18 incident, the Post conveyed that Nicholas engaged in acts of racism by “swarming” Phillips, “blocking” his exit away from the students, and otherwise engaging in racist misconduct,” the lawsuit continued. “The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump (“the President”) by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters of the President.”

The Posts libelous actions in reporting a hate crime hoax will follow Sandmann all of his days. He will apply to colleges, only to be denied because of his conservative right-to-life politics. He will apply to jobs, only to have human resources determine he is an aggregator. When in fact he is a kid who stood still, respectfully, with embarrassment all over his face.

How is this known? Watch the above video by Linn showing the whole story. Sandmann is seen encouraging his classmates to be respectful.

Which is exactly what he was doing.

We can anticipate the Post lawsuit is only the beginning for Sandmann. Hopefully, some big dollar payouts will stop future hoax hate crimes and the fools who spread their lies. And then we will see who is smirking now, Mr. Maher."

It’s even less common for the star to speak out in the comments section of a media report about cheating rumors. But that's how Khloe Kardashian seemingly confirmed that Tristan Thompson, the father of her daughter, True, is cheating with Jordyn Woods, the best friend of her younger sister, Kylie Jenner.

Jason Lee, the CEO of news and gossip site Hollywood Unlocked, posted an Instagram video Tuesday explaining how one of his writers saw Thompson and Woods together at a party Sunday night.

""Tristan, you took everybody's phone but you let them stay,"" he says in the video, which now has more than 1.2 million views. ""Jordyn came in. Y'all was smoking hookah. She was all up in your lap, you was all up over her touchy-feely. And you let the girl spend the night until 7 in the morning. Now, that happened. That's a fact.""

Kardashian commented on the post with the shouting emoji, seemingly confirming the report. And her friends piled on, too. Malika Haqq wrote, ""STRONG FACTS,"" and Larsa Pippen responded, ""Amen!!!""

Hollywood Unlocked beat all of the major gossip players—TMZ, People, Us Weekly, Page Six, even the Kardashians' own network E! News—to the scoop.

Lee's Hollywood Unlocked has a mix of aggregated news on trending topics like ""Chanel Names Its Successor Following the Death of Karl Lagerfeld,"" and ""Jussie Smollett's 'Empire' Scenes Cut After Attack Controversy,"" with exclusives like the Kardashian bombshell mixed in. There's also a podcast, ""Hollywood Unlocked [UNCENSORED]"" which has featured stars like Cardi B.

On Wednesday, Lee posted a followed-up video calling out TMZ for ripping off his site's Kardashian scoop, claiming it's not the first time it's happened.

“So, look, I’m going to put somebody else on blast. T-M-mother-fucking-Z. I’ve been on this Black brands matter for awhile, and I’ve let you mother fuckers steal from me in the past, but it stops today,"" he says. ""How are you going to post that you broke an exclusive when I’m the one who reached out to Khloe Kardashian to tell her that her baby daddy was cheating with Jordyn?

Lee, who has appeared on MTV's Wild N' Out and VH1's Love & Hip Hop Hollywood, started his site in 2015, according to the brand's LinkedIn page, which lists the privately held company as having 11-50 employees. The brand has 1.4 million Instagram followers and its reporting has been picked up by national media outlets like the New York Post, BBC, and ABC News.

Inspired by Angelica Nwandu's Instagram-based culture and news brand, The Shade Room, Lee focused on social media when he launched the brand four years ago.

""I spent a lot of time with the owner of The Shade Room and I remember when Angie had like 400,000 or 500,000 followers and she used to tell me 'just post good content and keep posting,'"" he said in a radio interview. ""I started creating engaging posts.""

Lee has not responded to Esquire's interview request. But last year he told Billboard about launching the brand: “There's a lot of power in the pen, you know, and there were a lot of stories being written about friends of mine that I thought weren't true or that weren't really written the right way, so I figured, well why don't I create a platform where I can jump in the arena and write what I see and what I know.""

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions, and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns, and blog posts for years:

—Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door.

Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post.

Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism.

It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism—until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal.

A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The university president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

—Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty, and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school’s library. The N-word and the hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

—Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

—Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. “A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,” the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

—Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institution museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election. The African-American museum director called them a “reminder of America’s dark history.”

But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times, and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

—Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN, and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn’t take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you’ve seen one social justice huckster, you’ve seen ’em all.

“Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State’s Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,” Robert Foley, a senior adviser to Foxx, said in an emailed statement Wednesday.

“Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State’s Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor,” he added.

The clarification came less than 24 hours after Foxx announced her recusal, in which she initially cited “potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.”

Foley did not respond to questions about when Foxx had those conversations and didn’t say what prompted the conversations between Foxx and Smollett’s family.

Smollett has told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident has been investigated as a hate crime.

Smollett’s claims have been scrutinized in the subsequent weeks. As of Wednesday, police said Smollett was “officially classified” as a suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a police report.

Two brothers — once considered suspects in reported attack — have met with police and prosecutors twice in recent days.

Foxx is also connected to one of the members of Smollett’s legal team. Records show that Vic Henderson, one of Smollett’s attorneys, gave $250 to Foxx’s campaign in 2016."

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

The New York Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a written statement.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces “Empire,” declined comment when told earlier on Wednesday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

‘MAGA COUNTRY’

Smollett has stood by his account even as police failed to find any evidence of an assault and suspicions grew on social media that it was a hoax.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognized from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

TV station CBS Chicago on Wednesday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

Smollett told police his assailants were white, that one wore a red hat, and that they shouted something about “MAGA country” - an apparent reference to Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” - as they struck him to the ground, the New York Times has reported.

Chicago police say the charge of filing a false police report carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.

“Empire” has earned multiple Emmy nominations since its 2015 debut. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

A 38-page, 35-count grand jury presentment against Philip Nordo includes multiple counts of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault and misconduct, intimidation, and theft of city funds.

52-year-old Nordo was fired in 2017 amid allegations that he funneled money into an imprisoned witness’ commissary account and that he maintained inappropriate relationships with people connected to criminal investigations.

But a deeper investigation into the matter revealed Nordo was up to much more than just fraternizing with suspects and witnesses.

Philly.com reports:

The grand jury found that Nordo “repeatedly contacted young men that he sought to groom,” and used threats and flattery to “make the targets of his advances more susceptible to his sexually assaultive and/or coercive behavior.” Prosecutors said Nordo’s tactics included threatening to arrest or jail suspects without probable cause, fraudulently steering reward money their way, and projecting his dominance–sometimes by displaying his firearm, other times by targeting handcuffed prisoners.

Most of the alleged abuse happened inside interrogation rooms or prison visiting rooms. ABC 6 reports: One victim reported in 2005 when he was arrested, Nordo goaded him into masturbating in an interrogation room, alleging the detective kissed him during the encounter, according to the report. That victim reported the incident to jail employees, but it was unclear from the report whether any disciplinary action was taken. The grand jury report noted the victim has since died in a homicide and the case has not been solved.

According to the heavily redacted grand jury document, Nordo would frequently “use small talk” to make his victims feel comfortable before ultimately turning the conversations to sex.

The Washington Post reports:

He would allegedly make inappropriate comments about the men’s genitals before assaulting them, preferring to target men in handcuffs or leg shackles so that “his dominating position reduced the individuals’ ability to resist or report the assault,” the document says. In recorded phone calls, he would talk about having sex with the men using “code words,” the document alleges. For those who cooperated, Nordo rewarded them with gift cards or deposited money into their inmate accounts, prosecutors said.

When Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor on the Fox TV show ""Empire,"" went public with a story that he had been viciously attacked near his home in Chicago, public opinion went full kangaroo court.

The details were horrifying. Smollett said he had been beaten, an unknown chemical poured on him, a noose placed around his neck. He said his attackers shouted racist and homophobic epithets and ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan — before fleeing the scene just as suddenly as they had arrived.

Very few people publicly questioned Smollett's assertions, even those that seemed difficult to believe. The actor claimed he had just purchased a Subway sandwich after a long plane flight, and was on the phone with his manager at 2AM, outdoors, on a historically cold night in Chicago when his masked attackers recognized the supporting actor on a TV show about the hip hop music industry, and set upon him.

Narrative and consequence

In 1989, a young woman was brutally raped, beaten within an inch of her life, and left for dead in New York City. ""The Central Park jogger,"" as she came to be known in the press, was an era-defining victim at a time when New York, and the United States, were experiencing near-historic high crime rates.

At the time, then-real estate developer and local celebrity Donald Trump — with his trademark flair for the hyperbolic — placed a full-page ad in New York's major newspapers, including The New York Times, and called for the re-reinstatement of the death penalty.

Though his assertion that ""muggers and murderers ... should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, should be executed for their crimes"" has received much of the attention in the years since, it's another line in that ad that's always curled my spine: ""Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!""

Trump's cultural influence in 1989 was nowhere near what it would become post-""The Apprentice,"" but his rage was hardly out of step with public opinion at the time, and is an example of how cultural forces set narratives that then become entrenched in both media coverage and policy.

The five African-American teenage boys arrested for the assault on the Central Park jogger became cultural symbols of their own, emblematic of the incorrigible ""superpredators"" — to borrow Hillary Clinton's term — that inspired the 1994 Crime Bill and helped exacerbate the US' ever-growing mass incarceration tragedy.

The ""Central Park Five"" were proven innocent in 2002, absolved by DNA evidence and the confession of a convicted rapist and murderer who admitted being the lone assailant. But the exoneration came too late to keep them from lengthy prison sentences, or from the incorrect public perception of the crime itself being used to cement a destructive narrative with consequences still being felt today.

It never mattered at the time whether the Five were innocent, what Trump (and much of the public) demanded was that the narrative be hardened, and policy affected as a result.

Due process for public opinion (in theory)

In the case of Jussie Smollett, it seems unlikely any innocent people will be arrested for a crime they didn't commit. But who's to say what could have happened if two men fitting the description of the figures in the surveillance footage were brought in for a police lineup?

Would the police have felt the need to arrest somebody, anybody, to comfort a public growling for justice? It's not as if police are never unduly influenced by political pressures, particularly in Chicago.

Thankfully, Jussie Smollett is getting due process under the law, with the Chicago PD's investigation still ongoing. If he is truly the victim of the crime he claims, we can only hope the perpetrators are held accountable. Similarly, if he did fabricate this assault and create a nationwide furor, then he too should face justice.

While Robin Roberts nodded sympathetically, Smollett scolded everybody who doubted his harrowing tale of intersectional oppression. If you were skeptical that he was really assaulted on an upscale Chicago street at 2 a.m. in sub-zero temperatures by Trump supporters with a bottle of bleach and a noose — who attacked him on sight while screaming, “This is MAGA country,” because they recognized him from his once-popular show Empire and hated him for his anti-Trump tweets — that meant you were a racist and a homophobe. Shame on you!

That was just hours before Smollet’s world started to fall apart, and now he’s rapidly running out of defenders. Even the writers on Empire, who just a few days ago angrily rebutted the claim that they were writing him out of the show, are now writing him out of the show. Nancy Pelosi is deleting the evidence that she believed him. The presidential candidates who leapt to his defense are now leaping the hell back. And all the while, the cops are closing in on him. This is not working out as planned.

As if all that isn’t bad enough, now it turns out that Smollett could be in trouble for yet another alleged fake hate crime, and the consequences could be even worse.

Charlie De Mar, CBS Chicago:

The two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett attack told police that Smollett was behind creating a racist letter that was sent to the actor on the set of his show, “Empire,” according to two sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation.

And when that letter did not get a “bigger reaction,” Smollett orchestrated the attack a week later with the two men–Ola and Abel Osundairo, sources said…

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD.

Here’s the note:

Latest in @JussieSmollett story: • Threat letter called “enormous mistake” that is “certain” to bring federal charges • Purported hate crime attack site determined — and it’s not where everyone thought • More here: https://t.co/jSbad1cSbl pic.twitter.com/f7BPlZjcQD — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) February 19, 2019

So, here’s a hypothesis: Let’s say you’re a fairly successful actor who happens to be black and gay. You write a fake letter to yourself, with “You will die black f*g” in letters cut out of magazines and a crudely drawn picture of yourself being shot, and you scrawl the return address “MAGA” on the envelope. You put in crushed aspirin so it looks like domestic terrorism. Then you send the letter to the address of the studio where your TV show is filmed.

You frame Trump supporters for attacking you because you’re black and gay. You know in your heart that it’s true, and you’re tired of waiting around for them to do something about it.

And… nobody cares. Yeah, the cops show up and do tests on it, all that stuff, but there’s no news coverage. There’s no outrage. This is how the lived experiences of black and gay people are dismissed in America, right? This is whiteness at work. They’re all so wrapped up in their privilege that they can’t accept that these things happen.

Well, okay, in this case it didn’t really happen, but it could have happened. Fake but accurate.

So then, hypothetically, it’s time to escalate matters. If a fake letter doesn’t get you the attention you deserve, if it doesn’t expose the people you hate most in the world, then it’s time to stage a fake hate crime. You hire a couple of guys you know from work, you send them on a shopping trip to get the appropriate supplies for a fake lynching, and you have them pretend to assault you.

And… success! This is what finally gets you the recognition and victimhood you crave. Celebrities and politicians line up to praise your bravery and condemn the sort of people who would commit such a horrible hate crime in [current year]. You’re the new face of the #Resistance. You’re a symbol of everything Trump and his racist, homophobic supporters hate. You’re what every woke American today aspires to be: a victim.

Then it all starts to collapse, over a few measly facts.

If Smollett faked this letter, he could face federal charges in addition to the almost-certain state and local charges in Chicago. Let’s hope it was worth the trouble, just to be a celebrated victim for a couple of weeks."

Attorney Gloria Schmidt speaks to reporters at the at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago

By Dan Whitcomb and Gina Cherelus

(Reuters) - Actor Jussie Smollett was charged on Wednesday with lying to police when he claimed he was attacked and beaten on the streets of Chicago by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs, police said on Wednesday as they sought his arrest.

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

""Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

The New York Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,"" Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a written statement.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces ""Empire,"" declined comment when told earlier on Wednesday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""

'MAGA COUNTRY'

Smollett has stood by his account even as police failed to find any evidence of an assault and suspicions grew on social media that it was a hoax.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognized from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

TV station CBS Chicago on Wednesday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

Smollett told police his assailants were white, that one wore a red hat, and that they shouted something about ""MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" - as they struck him to the ground, the New York Times has reported.

Chicago police say the charge of filing a false police report carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.

""Empire"" has earned multiple Emmy nominations since its 2015 debut. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

(Tribune News Service) — In a week when the U.S. culture wars focused on actor Jussie Smollett’s reportedly false claim of being the victim of a hate crime and on Donald Trump’s calling immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a “national emergency,” people also were on Twitter, fiercely debating John Wayne’s infamous, racially charged 1971 Playboy interview, during which he observed, “I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.”

While Wayne died nearly 40 years ago, the famed actor was a No. 1 trending topic on Twitter from Monday night through Tuesday afternoon.

There were people who questioned whether there were more relevant issues to worry about than things Wayne said in 1971, and others who joked about whether Wayne still would be able to get work in Hollywood.

Yet for others, Wayne’s legacy lives on — and not just at the Orange County, Calif., airport named after him. For some, his comments are disturbingly relevant to discussions still taking place in 2019.

Journalist and author Glenn Greenwald joined in the Twitter debate about the interview, which you can read in full here. In his 2008 book, “Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics,” Greenwald said the staunchly Republican actor has long served as a template for right-wing notions of “American courage and conservative manliness,” Publishers Weekly reported.

That’s largely because Wayne played World War II heroes and stalwart figures of the American West in many of the more than 200 Hollywood films he made from 1926 to 1977.

Greenwald, a co-founder of The Intercept, tweeted: “I devoted a book chapter to John Wayne, a conservative icon & one of the 20th Century’s most deceitful & pitiful men. A supporter of McCarthy, war cheerleader & moralizer who casually impugned patriotism & called people perverts while draft-dodging & having serial drunken affairs.”

As Greenwald suggested, Wayne’s biography shows that Wayne was anything but a real-life war hero. Other critics argued Tuesday, as they have for decades, that Wayne was no model of physical courage or moral rectitude.

Wayne’s record included three marriages and affairs, apparently doing all he could to avoid military service in World War II, leading efforts to help U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunt down Communists in Hollywood and holding views about race that many say were retrograde in 1971.

In the Playboy interview, Wayne, then in his 60s and fresh off his Oscar win for “True Grit,” discussed a range of topics, from working in Hollywood to race and sex. One of the more noteworthy quotes in the interview came up in a discussion about African-American political activist and academic Angela Davis.

“With a lot of blacks, there’s quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so,” Wayne said. “But we can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”

Later in the interview, Wayne also said he didn’t feel “guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago (black) people were slaves.” Wayne continued: “Now, I’m not condoning slavery. It’s just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can’t play football with the rest of us.”

Wayne also decried “tokenism” in Hollywood. But he said he had been willing to give black actors opportunities in films he directed by hiring an actor to play “a black slave in ‘The Alamo’ ” and by having a “correct number of blacks in ‘The Green Berets.’ ”

Also in the interview, Wayne, whose Western films like “The Searchers” were accused of perpetuating stereotypes about Native Americans, accused Native Americans of “selfishly trying to keep (North America) to themselves.”

He also blasted Communists for teaching in American public schools and the depiction of gay sex in “Midnight Cowboy,” the 1970 best picture Oscar winner. Wayne used a homophobic slur to describe the characters played by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.

Matt Williams, a screenwriter who shared excerpts of the interview, wrote: “Jesus (expletive). John Wayne was a straight up piece of (expletive).”

Williams also pointed out that Wayne turned down a role in Mel Brooks’ Western spoof “Blazing Saddles” because the language was too “blue.”

Among those weighing in on Wayne’s interview were comedian Patton Oswalt, who addressed the actor’s quote that he gave African-American actors opportunities in his films.

“ ‘If it’s supposed to be a black character, naturally I use a black actor’ was as ‘woke’ as John Wayne got, I guess,” Oswalt tweeted.

Producer Joe Carnahan excoriated Wayne for being a war hawk, especially during the Vietnam War, even though he dodged service during World War II. Carnahan mentioned some of Wayne’s famous contemporaries who signed up to serve, including in combat units.

Speaking of Wayne’s World War II record, Wayne started the war with a 3-A deferment from the draft for family dependency because he was the sole provider for a family of four, DenofGeek.com and film historian Karina Longworth explained in her “You Must Remember This” podcast. But those family deferments were recalled later. Wayne then qualified for a 2-A deferment because he was in Hollywood, engaged in making morale-building films that were believed to serve an important propaganda purpose, Longworth said.

There are conflicting accounts about whether Wayne made a serious attempt to join some branch of the military service. He appeared interested in a position in a unit of the Office of Strategic Services, where director John Ford was making documentary and reconnaissance films, according to Longworth. Ford had made Wayne a star by casting him in “Stagecoach” in 1939.

But it also appears that Wayne kept putting off joining the unit, saying he needed to finish up his next set of films, Longworth added. Ford continued to let Wayne know he was disappointed in his failure to serve, saying he was getting rich making movies while other men died, according to the PBS documentary American Masters.

Wayne’s reluctance to leave Hollywood may have been due a torrid love affair he was having with occasional co-star Marlene Dietrich, according to writer Marc Eliot in his book, “American Titan: Searching for John Wayne.” Longworth also said he may have worried how a long absence from Hollywood would affect his career.

In any case, Wayne’s lack of military service was back on people’s minds Tuesday, as were his “white supremacy,” slavery and tokenism comments. Wayne had some defenders on Twitter who said his views are not that shocking when seen in the context of 1971.

But others insisted that times haven’t changed as much as others think.

“Seeing John Wayne complain about seeing gay relationships in movies and accusing diverse roles of “tokenism” pretty much tells me (expletive) hasn’t changed one bit,” wrote one person.

But others said it’s not useful to get worked up about Wayne’s comments when there are so many other “truly egregious” events to be concerned about:

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set,” the show’s studio, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, said in a Wednesday statement to ITK.

The 36-year-old performer told Chicago police last month that he was assaulted by two men who beat him, placed a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him as they yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him.

But authorities now believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack against himself and paid two men to stage it, CNN reported Sunday, citing police sources.

TMZ had reported earlier this week that as a result of the swelling controversy, Smollett’s “Empire” screen time was “getting slashed,” according to production sources.

But 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment characterized its comments as a “statement of support” for Smollett.

A Chicago Police Department spokesman told ITK on Tuesday that authorities had information that “needs to be corroborated and verified” with Smollett. “After new developments, we've reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him,” Anthony Guglielmi, the department’s chief communications officer, said."

Empire star Jussie Smollett is expected to be indicted in ""a matter of hours. Not days,"" according to Chicago's Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel.

The news comes shortly after word that Smollett's defense team was able to postpone testimony in front of a Cook County grand jury testimony by two men once considered potential suspects in the case.

Two men once considered potential suspects in the alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett were moments away from testifying to a Cook County grand jury, before a last-minute phone call from Smollett’s defense team convinced prosecutors to postpone the testimony. CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar has learned the brothers were waiting outside the grand jury chambers at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse on Tuesday, just minutes from testifying, when the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office got a call from Smollett’s lawyers, claiming they may have new evidence. -CBS Chicago

The two men, brothers Ola and Abel Osundario were arrested last week, however Chicago PD released them without charges after they reportedly said that Smollett paid them $3,500 each to stage a January 29 predawn ""hate crime"" attack designed to make Trump supporters look like bigots.

According to CBS, ""About a dozen search warrants have now been issued, including ones for Smollett’s financial and phone records, and detectives are waiting for those records to come back.""

Update from court confusion Monday:

The Osundario brothers said that Smollett concocted the hoax after a racist letter containing a white substance which was mailed to the Chicago Empire studio failed to have the impact Smollett intended.

The evening of the alleged attack, the Osundarios poured a chemical on the actor, placed a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs, including ""this is MAGA country.""

As a result, narratives shape public perception, sometimes to great societal detriment.

When actor Jussie Smollett claimed to have been savagely attacked, many lawmakers, celebrities, and media outlets immediately ran with the story.

Smollett's claims have since come into question, but not before the alleged attack was deemed by many influencers as emblematic of the racism, homophobia, and violence of the Trump era.

In 1989, Donald Trump himself infamously used a savage crime to push a narrative that ""CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!"" - even though the accused were later proven innocent.

Many lawmakers, with public support, nonetheless ran with that narrative to justify draconian increases in prison sentencing.

Rather than take up rhetorical arms against our political adversaries, we ought to calmly, soberly look deeper into the facts and exercise patience. Think of it as a civic exercise in due process.

Due process doesn't exist in the court of public opinion.

The cops don't read you your rights. If you can't afford a crisis response public relations team, none will be provided. There are no fair trials.When Jussie Smollett , a gay African-American actor on the Fox TV show ""Empire,"" went public with a story that he had been viciously attacked near his home in Chicago, public opinion went full kangaroo court.

The details were horrifying. Smollett said he had been beaten, an unknown chemical poured on him, a noose placed around his neck. He said his attackers shouted racist and homophobic epithets and ""this is MAGA country"" - a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan - before fleeing the scene just as suddenly as they had arrived.

""Connect the dots. This is what happens...""

Very few people publicly questioned Smollett's assertions, even those that seemed difficult to believe. The actor claimed he had just purchased a Subway sandwich after a long plane flight, and was on the phone with his manager at 2AM, outdoors, on a historically cold night in Chicago when his masked attackers recognized the supporting actor on a TV show about the hip hop music industry, and set upon him.

Presidential candidates and Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker described the attack as an ""attempted modern day lynching."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted (and has since deleted), ""The racist homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity.""

Superstar freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York tweeted , ""This attack was not 'possibly' homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack."" Actress Ellen Page laid responsibility on Vice President Mike Pence's opposition to gay marriage and past support of gay conversion therapy in an appearance on the ""Late Show."" ""Connect the dots. This is what happens,"" Page told host Stephen Colbert.

During an interview with ABC's Robin Roberts, Smollett said he had no doubt the two figures in surveillance photo released by the Chicago PD were the men who attacked him.

Now that two brothers - one of whom worked as Smollett's personal trainer - have reportedly told police Smollett paid them to orchestrate the attack, the entire narrative has dramatically shifted.

Some in the media have argued that whether or not Smollett cynically staged his own attack is beside the point; what's important is keeping the focus on hate crimes perpetrated against marginalized communities who some insist are under siege in a wave of Trump-era racism, homophobia, and violence.

But it's possible to do two things at once. One can continue to shine light on crimes of bias and discriminatory policies, and still come away from this fiasco of a story with something resembling a ""teachable moment.""

Narrative and consequence

Advertisement

In 1989, a young woman was brutally raped, beaten within an inch of her life, and left for dead in New York City. ""The Central Park jogger,"" as she came to be known in the press, was an era-defining victim at a time when New York, and the United States, were experiencing near-historic high crime rates.At the time, then-real estate developer and local celebrity Donald Trump - with his trademark flair for the hyperbolic - placed a full-page ad in New York's major newspapers, including The New York Times, and called for the re-reinstatement of the death penalty.

Though his assertion that ""muggers and murderers ... should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, should be executed for their crimes"" has received much of the attention in the years since, it's another line in that ad that's always curled my spine: ""Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!""

Advertisement

Trump's cultural influence in 1989 was nowhere near what it would become post-""The Apprentice,"" but his rage was hardly out of step with public opinion at the time, and is an example of how cultural forces set narratives that then become entrenched in both media coverage and policy.

The five African-American teenage boys arrested for the assault on the Central Park jogger became cultural symbols of their own, emblematic of the incorrigible ""superpredators"" - to borrow Hillary Clinton's term - that inspired the 1994 Crime Bill and helped exacerbate the US' ever-growing mass incarceration tragedy.

Due process for public opinion (in theory)

The ""Central Park Five"" were proven innocent in 2002 , absolved by DNA evidence and the confession of a convicted rapist and murderer who admitted being the lone assailant. But the exoneration came too late to keep them from lengthy prison sentences, or from the incorrect public perception of the crime itself being used to cement a destructive narrative with consequences still being felt today. It never mattered at the time whether the Five were innocent, what Trump (and much of the public) demanded was that the narrative be hardened, and policy affected as a result.

In the case of Jussie Smollett, it seems unlikely any innocent people will be arrested for a crime they didn't commit. But who's to say what could have happened if two men fitting the description of the figures in the surveillance footage were brought in for a police lineup?

Would the police have felt the need to arrest somebody, anybody, to comfort a public growling for justice? It's not as if police are never unduly influenced by political pressures, particularly in Chicago.

Thankfully, Jussie Smollett is getting due process under the law, with the Chicago PD's investigation still ongoing. If he is truly the victim of the crime he claims, we can only hope the perpetrators are held accountable. Similarly, if he did fabricate this assault and create a nationwide furor, then he too should face justice.

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart said on MSNBC Monday that ""a reality for a lot of people in this country since President Trump was inaugurated, that there is an atmosphere of menace and an atmosphere of hate around the country that made it possible for people to either readily believe or want to believe Jussie Smollett.""

Everyone is informed by their own experience, and sometimes a ""narrative"" is simply the truth. But it's unreasonable to presume an outrageous story is unimpeachable just because it conforms to a narrative that feeds one's perceptions.When the narratives surrounding outrageous crimes prove false, they can still shape public perception in dangerous ways. Not only is there a less-than-zero chance innocent people could be directly harmed by false stories that inflame the public, but they also have a way of infectingand policy, with consequences that can last decades longer than the 24-hour news cycle.

Even if due process in public opinion will only ever be theoretical, it's far healthier for society than instant mass fury.

Last month, television star Jussie Smollett was treated for scratches on his face after an alleged racist and anti-gay attack in Chicago. Different sources reported different details, but one commonly reported detail was that two suspects asked him, “Aren’t you that f***ot Empire n***er?” Then he was supposedly attacked with bleach and a rope. The suspects allegedly yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

In an age of hate hoaxes, many people took this report skeptically. The idea of people in Chicago screaming about “MAGA country” is self-discrediting. Another problem with Mr. Smollett’s story was that he was supposedly recognized on the street at two in the morning by racist right-wingers who were also familiar with the show Empire. (I didn’t know about the existence of either Empire or Mr. Smollett until the alleged attack, and I assume the same about most people who voted for Trump.) The weapon of choice was also strange for a frigid Chicago night well below bleach’s freezing temperature.

The story’s details kept changing, but Mr. Smollett’s behavior was consistently bizarre. Mr. Smollett reportedly refused to let police examine his phone. He also walked into his apartment building wearing a rope around his neck and didn’t notify police immediately. Despite his claim that “I fought the f**k back!” against two attackers, the rather effete Mr. Smollett still managed to hold on to a Subway sandwich he purchased before the alleged incident.

This reads like ludicrous fan fiction. Yet the most powerful and influential people in our society, from the Speaker of the House of Representatives to Hollywood celebrities, declared this attack not only legitimate, but of huge moral importance. What’s more, they insisted that the incident must be used to inspire political and cultural activism.

Senator Cory Booker:

Senator Gillibrand’s statement about “condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it” was echoed by mainstream media outlets, which gave the incident huge coverage.

Entertainers exploded with fury against President Donald Trump and his supporters, who were blamed for the “attack.” “I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell,” declared actor Billy Eichner. “[T]here is no question that since he [President Trump] has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving,” tweeted Rob Reiner. “No intolerance! No DT!”

The highlight was a secular sermon by actress Ellen Page on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show. The actress delivered an obscenity-laden condemnation of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, linking them to the supposed crime and urging people to “connect the dots.” The audience gave her a standing ovation, and the video has been seen over 18 million times.

“Civil-rights organizations” dutifully “connected the dots” between the supposed attack and the president from the moment the news broke. The NAACP blamed the president, saying, “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric.” The SPLC promoted the attack, especially the supposed cry of “This is MAGA country!” GLAAD declared that “Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America” and expressed concern about “Chicago’s Black and LGBTQ communities who may be experiencing heightened fears of violence.” One wonders who does not fear violence in Chicago.

President Trump was condemned for not expressing sufficient outrage about the attack. He “has not tweeted about the alleged attack — but has tweeted about caravans and the border wall,” wrote Samantha Allen on January 30 in “What ‘Empire’ Star Jussie Smollett’s Attack Reveals About Hate Crime in America.” On January 31, the left-wing website Think Progress reported that President Trump and Republicans were “silent…despite ‘MAGA’ comments.” The next day, the president called the alleged attack “horrible” and said “it doesn’t get worse.” President Trump has never said such a thing about the frequent attacks against his own supporters, including a case over the weekend where a man allegedly pulled a gun on a couple wearing MAGA hats.

The criticism directed against those who doubted the story is a possible reason so many people went along with this laughable tale. Alex Henderson at AlterNet wrote a piece entitled, “Far-right extremists are claiming Jussie Smollett attack is a left-wing hoax.” Alex Kaplan at Media Matters complained, “Twitter search suggestions promoted right-wing smear that attack against Jussie Smollett was a hoax.” “Is Donald Trump Jr. promoting a Jussie Smollett conspiracy theory?” asked Martha Ross in The Mercury News, calling the president’s son “no stranger to promoting questionable stories.”

This rhetoric has consequences. The morning after Mr. Smollett received a positive interview on Good Morning America, the Senate passed legislation making lynching a federal crime. Senator Booker specifically referenced the alleged attack on Mr. Smollett to justify the legislation. Black Republican Senator Tim Scott, who has frequently used his race to attack his own party, was among those who introduced the legislation. Thus, even if the supposed crime never happened, it has already been used as an excuse to change American law.

Mr. Smollett’s original story has collapsed. It appears that he concocted the assault with the assistance of two Nigerian brothers who knew him before this incident. After being arrested and then released, the Osundairo brothers issued a statement denying any racist or homophobic intent and even denying they are “anti-Trump.” The attack was reportedly concocted after Mr. Smollett became upset by the scant attention that was aroused by a racist letter sent to the Empire studio. CBS — citing two sources — is now reporting that Mr. Smollett was behind the letter as well. If true, he could be charged with a federal crime.

Those who signal-boosted the original incident are now backtracking. Senator Kamala Harris, who clearly did not have a prepared statement, seemingly panicked when confronted about the issue at a campaign stop. She laughed awkwardly and looked around for help. Cory Booker declared he would “withhold” comment until more information emerged, a notable contrast to his initial reaction. He also continued to blame right-wingers for domestic terrorism. “We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way,” he said, “and we actually know in this country that since 9/11, the majority of terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks — the majority of them white supremacist attacks.” Nancy Pelosi has deleted her tweet about the “attack.” Meanwhile, Brian Stelter at CNN claimed the mainstream media had been “really careful” in reporting the alleged attack.

In the days following the incident, Mr. Smollett struck a heroic pose. He claimed he was attacked because he is an opponent of President Trump. He said he was initially reluctant to report the incident. Days ago, he said he was “devastated” by reports claiming he had staged the attacks. His lawyers say he has been further “victimized” by all the suspicion. One suspects he may have convinced himself the attack actually happened.

Donald Trump’s supporters should be happy that another media offensive against them has collapsed. “Hate crimes that have the structure of perfectly crafted narratives should be regarded with skepticism until they’re proven true,” writes Kyle Smith at National Review.

However, this advice presupposes journalists are interested in reporting facts. Something deeper is at work. The attention given to a petty crime in a city with hundreds of murders a year, the rapturous reception given to Ellen Page’s denunciation of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and the desperate willingness of so many seemingly intelligent people to believe a ridiculous story suggest semi-religious motivations among Jussie Smollett’s true believers. Mr. Smollett’s frantic quest to be perceived as a victim of white racist violence is akin to those Christian martyrs who sought death in the arena for a new faith. The main difference is that Christian martyrs actually had to suffer.

If anti-racism is a faith, the devil figure is the hated white male, blamed for every failing, problem, and historical grievance plaguing non-whites. Socialist countries needed “wreckers” to explain why central planning didn’t work; anti-racism requires the existence of violent white racists to explain egalitarianism’s failures. If there aren’t enough real racists out there, they need to be invented. Therefore, Democrats, liberal journalists, and others who believe in the egalitarian myth probably won’t learn anything from the Jussie Smollett case. This will happen again. Many Americans desperately want to be a victim of the “oppressor” and so become a person of importance with a life that means something. This is also why wealthy suburban mothers who oppose the president are pretending they are in the French #Resistance or The Handmaid’s Tale. After the collapse of traditional Christianity, a new faith has taken power in the West.

Even those who think they are on the Right are in egalitarianism’s thrall. S. E. Cupp, one of CNN’s anti-Trump “conservative” pundits, argues that the story is “sad no matter your politics.” She faults Donald Trump supporters’ “giddiness” since the story’s predictable disintegration, the phenomenon John Derbyshire calls “Narrative Collapse.” S. E. Cupp and others argue that real hate-crime victims are the ones who have been wronged here.

Yet the people who were targeted by Jussie Smollett’s actions were white men, especially ones who supported Trump. If Mr. Smollett hadn’t been so clumsy in planning in his “attack,” innocent white men could have been arrested and blamed or simply named “suspects” and been destroyed by the media. Whites in Chicago and around the country were endangered by these lurid tales of right-wing gangs setting upon innocent blacks. This wasn’t simply a false report or a waste of resources — if the latest reports about Jussie Smollett’s actions are true, this was a deliberate attack on white people.

It needs to be treated that way. Absent radical change, there will always be motivation for hate hoaxes. There will always be those with a psychological need for the perceived meaning and significance that comes with “victim” status. The material rewards given to “victims,” whether through online fundraising or talk-show tributes, are also too strong. Thus, there need to be real consequences.

Donald Trump, Jr. has been tweeting furiously about this case. He should tell his father to do something to stop these kinds of cases. Going forward, a false report of a hate crime should be treated as a hate crime targeting the accused group. Mr. Smollett, liberal journalists, and some Democrat politicians blamed Donald Trump supporters and whites generally for an act that didn’t happen. This lie has already been used to push changes to American law, and had it gone unexamined, it would have been used to justify more funding for “diversity” programs and laws that demonize whites.

Jussie Smollett’s actions were not just a lie or a false report; they were a racist attack against our people. Worse, this blood libel was repeated by our society’s most powerful institutions. We demand more than an apology. We demand #JusticeForJussie."

Not only is there a greater-than-zero chance innocent people could be directly harmed by false stories that inflame the public, but they also have a way of infecting politics and policy, with consequences that can last decades longer than the 24-hour news cycle.

Even if due process in public opinion will only ever be theoretical, it's far healthier for society than instant mass fury.

Rather than take up rhetorical arms against our political adversaries, we ought to calmly, soberly look deeper into the facts and exercise patience. Think of it as a civic exercise in due process."

Smollett, 36, last month told police in Chicago that two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs had accosted him on the street and put a rope around his neck. Smollett, an openly gay African-American man, also plays a gay man on the show.

The news sparked outrage on social media, but some questioned Smollett’s account when apparent inconsistencies began to surface.

ABC 7 Chicago last week quoted unnamed sources saying Smollett staged the attack to gain publicity because he was losing his role on “Empire,” a drama about a battle for control of a hip-hop musical empire.

But Chicago police said there was no evidence to support that report.

The company that produces the show issued a statement on Wednesday supporting Smollett. “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said.

Police have not found any surveillance video of the reported attack, which they said was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

Detectives last week questioned two unnamed men identified from surveillance camera footage showing two people walking on a sidewalk near where Smollett said he was assaulted. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Friday the two were released without being charged.

The case took another turn on Tuesday after Chicago police began investigating a tip that Smollett was seen inside his apartment building with the two men who were being questioned. Guglielmi later said the tip was “unfounded” and not supported by video evidence.

Guglielmi said on Sunday detectives were attempting to speak with Smollett again to follow up on his initial report of an attack on Jan. 29.

In an interview with Good Morning America that aired on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people doubted his story, and he suggested the disbelief might stem from racial bias. (Reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)"

While law enforcement was looking into these claims, rumors circulated that the Empire actor had orchestrated the attack.

On 18 February 2019, the Babylon Bee website added their own fictional twist to this story when they published an article reporting that Smollett had been offered a job at the CNN.

The network, according to the Babylon Bee, was reportedly impressed with Smollett’s ability to fabricate a story out of thin air:

While Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been having a tough week so far, there appears to be a silver lining: cable news channel CNN has offered Smollett a job as an investigative reporter and on-air anchor after witnessing his skills at fabricating a story entirely out of thin air. CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett’s apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn’t add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he’d be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated.

This was not a genuine news story, although some readers mistook it for such. The Babylon Bee is a satirical website whose disclaimer notes that “The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.”"

Anthony Guglielmi said charges were approved by the Cook County State's Attorney Office and ""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.""

Filing a false police report is disorderly conduct, according to Illinois code. A class 4 felony is punishable by one to three years, the code says

A bail hearing is anticipated for 1:30 p.m. CT Thursday, prosecutors said.

Smollett's transformation from victim to suspect in a reported attack that captured national headlines came on the same day that a high-ranking police source said Chicago detectives were working to obtain the actor's financial records.

A Cook County grand jury met Wednesday just weeks after the young actor reported being the victim of a hate crime on January 29

Smollett's attorneys released a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Video appears to show brothers buy items

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN that police believe Smollett paid two brothers to orchestrate an assault on him.

Surveillance video obtained from a Chicago-area beauty supply store appears to show the brothers connected to the incident purchasing a ski mask, sunglasses, a red hat and other items the day before the alleged assault on the actor.

The January 28 video shows two men shopping. They paid in cash, said the owner, who wishes not to be identified.

The video was turned over to police on Friday, the owner told CNN.

The brothers, who were arrested and released in connection with the attack, met Tuesday with police and prosecutors at a Chicago courthouse, police spokesman Tom Ahern said. The county's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, has recused herself from the investigation, according to a spokeswoman from her office.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for the brothers, told reporters Wednesday that her clients had not accepted a plea deal or immunity.

""You don't need immunity when you have the truth, "" she said.

The brothers were paid by the actor, she said, but the amount is ""not fitting the narrative that is out there now.""

Actor denies role

Smollett's attorneys met with Cook County prosecutors earlier in the day, according to Ahern.

Smollett told authorities that two men attacked him, putting a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

The actor denies playing a role in his attack, according to his attorneys.

In a statement before Smollett was named a suspect, 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the series ""Empire"" on which Smollett appears, and Fox Entertainment expressed support for the actor.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" the statement said.

A Fox spokesperson had no comment when reached by CNN on Wednesday.

Brothers are cooperating with law enforcement, sources say

The two men questioned by police -- whom Schmidt identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo -- were arrested February 13 but released without charges Friday after police cited the discovery of ""new evidence."" The two are no longer suspects at this time, Chicago police have said.

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM , the men said: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Abimbola Osundairo was arrested and then released without being charged.

Anne Kavanagh of Media Pros 24/7, a media consulting firm representing Smollett, released a statement this week, saying in part, ""Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.""

The police sources said that the brothers are cooperating with law enforcement and said that records show they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Olabinjo Osundairo also was released without being charged.

Actor told police he was attacked near entrance of a Loews hotel

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement Saturday describing their client as angry about allegations he orchestrated the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement said.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett is openly gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama ""Empire.""

The actor told detectives two men attacked him near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago, according to police spokesman Guglielmi. Police were told the two men yelled, "" 'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er,' "" while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The day after last month's incident, police released surveillance images showing two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

Police late last week said the men were being viewed as ""potential suspects."" But by Friday night they had been released , Guglielmi said.

One of the men has appeared on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett but did not provide additional details.

Seven days before the alleged attack, a letter containing white powder was sent to the Chicago set of ""Empire,"" police have said. Authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, according to Guglielmi.

The image of the letter and envelope, shared with CNN by a person close to Smollett, includes a message apparently cut from magazine clippings, and a stick figure drawing.

Smollett told ABC News the drawing was of a ""stick figure hanging from a tree which had a gun pointing towards it."" The letter, addressed to Smollett, includes the word ""MAGA"" on the outside of the envelope in place of the return address.

More than a decade ago, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case, according to Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

The case stemmed from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police the wrong name.

Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver license.

He was sentenced to two years of probation and paid a fine, according to Mateljan.

Smollett expressed frustration about not being believed

Smollett gave his first detailed account last week of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with ABC's "" Good Morning America .""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Smollett said that one of the attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" before punching him in the face. But he denied reports that said he told police the attackers wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

""I never said that,"" he told ABC's Robin Roberts in an interview that aired February 14. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.""

Correction: This story and headline have been updated to clarify that Smollett has not been officially charged. Also, the story has been updated to correct the last name of Anne Kavanagh."

Hours after Empire actor Jussie Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police, after being charged late Wednesday of felony disorderly conduct for making a false police report, his bosses have issued a statement that they are weighing their options in regards to his future on the show. Smollett, 36, claimed on January 29 that two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs attacked him outside of a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. After interviewing the two men for 48 hours and releasing them, Chicago police announced at a press conference Thursday that Smollett staged the incident and paid $3,500 to two men to help him carry it out.

Although 20th Century Fox Television has stood by the actor as rumors of a hoax swirled for the last couple of weeks, things changed after the actor was arrested. “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,” the statement read. “We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”

Chicago police said Smollett was motivated to orchestrate a fake attack because he is unhappy with his salary and wanted attention. Empire is currently in production on the penultimate episode of its fifth season. Since Smollett reported the attack, his bosses and colleagues have not wavered in their support. In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours before a grand jury indicted Smollett, the studio said: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

Rep. Nick Zerwas, R-Elk River, described the measure, expected later this session, as ""a reasonable step to help deter individuals from filing false police reports and to make sure that we devote law enforcement's limited resources to investigating and prosecuting legitimate bias-motivated crimes.""

Zerwas said he was motivated to bring the issue forward after recent reports that police believed ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett may have staged a January attack by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs. Smollett has denied that claim through his lawyers.

In recent days, Zerwas has written about the case in multiple posts on Twitter, describing it as part of a ""recent rise in fake victimization"" and a symptom of media bias.

""As news reports continue to emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that the highly publicized alleged hate crime in Chicago last month was a hoax,"" Zerwas said Wednesday. ""We need to send a message that similar hoaxes are not welcome in Minnesota as they only seek to divide us and distract from legitimate acts of bias-motivated violence.""

Minnesota's current law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly make a false report to law enforcement, and a gross misdemeanor to falsely report criminal police misconduct. Zerwas wants to make it a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and/or a $3,000 fine — to falsely report a hate crime.

The proposal would face long odds in the Democrat-controlled house, where Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, D-Golden Valley, on Wednesday called it ""an attention-getting bill from a member in the minority.""

""I don't think we need to create a chilling effect on people reporting hate crimes, which if anything is underreported,"" Winkler said.

Sen. Jeff Hayden, D-Minneapolis, said more attention should be placed on ""actual hate crimes and … actual injustice going on in communities and not every once in a while when somebody does something foolish.""

""I would rather Rep. Zerwas work with coalitions of people, his voice as a leader, his voice as a Republican and his voice as a white man go so much farther in helping make sure we tell the state that when someone perpetrates a hate crime that's something that they shouldn't do,"" Hayden said.

Zerwas' legislative push comes amid an ongoing rise in reported hate crimes in Minnesota, and the country, figures that are already widely viewed as failing to account for the actual rate of such crimes.

A spokeswoman for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which collects bias-crime data from Minnesota agencies to send to the FBI, said local agencies do not submit data on false reports.

The FBI reported last year that hate crimes climbed more than 22 percent in Minnesota, up from 119 in 2016 to 146 in 2017, the most recent year for which data was available.

The bureau relies on voluntary reporting from law enforcement agencies. But Minnesota law enforcement agencies approach classifying and reporting hate crimes differently — according to the FBI's latest report, more than 310 police agencies reported zero hate crimes in 2017. That included Bloomington, where members of an Illinois militia bombed the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center because, as one member later admitted, they wanted to intimidate Muslims.

Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, said preliminary figures in a study of FBI hate crime data found fewer than 50 false reports nationwide out of an estimated 21,000 crimes tallied between 2016 and 2018.

""I have no problem with general laws respecting false reporting being enforced,"" Levin said. ""But I'm concerned that an overreaction to a minuscule problem will actually exacerbate the problem that there are real victims out there whose stories we don't hear and police reports don't classify."""

Just three if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown, Tommy Chong, Rumer Willis and Joey Fatone all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Peacock, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

Smollett’s only televised interview about the alleged incident was given to Good Morning America, but now the Blast is reporting that staffers on the show felt doubtful about the veracity of his story when he sat down to speak to host Robin Roberts.

Smollett has claimed that he was accosted by two masked men on January 29 near Loews hotel in Chicago. According to his account, they yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a noose around his neck, and threw a chemical substance over him — a substance which is believed to have been bleach.

During the interview, he seemed offended by the fact that he was being accused of fabricating the story.

“I’m p*ssed off,” the actor said. “At first it was a thing of ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, that’s it ‘cuz it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of ‘How can you doubt that, how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.'”

The Blast did not stipulate which part of the interview gave staffers an inkling that Smollett’s story might have been less than factual, just that they were left with the feeling that things did not add up.

One of CBS Chicago‘s most recent articles on the situation reports that the two Nigerian brothers who were initially suspects have said that Smollett was involved in the creation of a racist letter that was sent to the actor while he was shooting Empire. They claim that the actor staged the attack because the letter did not capture the media’s attention. CBS’ sources also say that there’s video footage of the men using a ride-share that night in order to travel to a spot near the location of the purported attack.

The brothers were set to give their testimony to a grand jury on Tuesday, but that’s been postponed after Smollett’s defense team claimed that they have new evidence.

The FBI is investigating to see if Jussie Smollett sent a racist, threatening letter to himself.

When Smollett’s story first made news, it triggered a wave of sympathy from celebrities. Now, as more questions are raised, that tide is turning against him. As the Inquisitr previously reported, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has deleted a tweet posted in support of Smollett. Rapper Cardi B said that the actor would ruin Black History Month if his story was a lie, but said that she was still holding out for more facts to emerge.

Others found the humor in the situation. During an episode of The Daily Show, host Trevor Noah said that the story about Jussie Smollett rehearsing the attack in advance made sense to him.

“If I was paying these two to beat me up, I would want to practice too, OK?” he said as he referenced a photo of the brothers. “Look at this photo — how many abs does the guy on the left have? It looks like he stole a couple of abs from the other guy!”"

This Jussie Smollett case has gone off the rails as the evidence stacks up against his story of being the victim of a hate crime.

One increasingly suspicious factor? His seeming unwillingness to sit down for another interview with investigators.

That does sound like something a guilty person would do…

But on Tuesday that apparently changed as TMZ reports his team called in at the last minute, postponing a grand jury in which Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were set to testify, presumably the story we’ve heard from insiders — that Jussie staged the attack with them.

According to police sources, investigators now believe the date of the attack was chosen specifically because the Osundairos were scheduled to leave the country the next day.

It’s unclear whether Jussie himself has agreed to meet with police again, but his legal team definitely have.

Meanwhile, Jussie’s family have his back — as does his Empire family.

20th Century Fox Television told TheBlast in a statement on Wednesday the actor not only was never slated to be written off the show before all this — he still won’t be:

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated he is not being written out of the show.”

That is, we have to assume, unless he ends up going to jail.

We can’t be certain where this case will go from here, but despite statements to the contrary, right now it does not look good for Jussie or Jamal Lyon.

TMZ — which was the first to issue reports on the alleged hate crime against the “Empire” actor — is now reporting on a number of concerning bits of information shared by unnamed sources “connected to the investigation” within the Chicago Police Department.

Chief among the revelations was that when Smollett was asked by law enforcement in the early days of the investigation if he wanted to file formal complaints against his alleged assailants, Smollett indicated he was more than willing to do so.

However, once the identities of the two men taken into custody were revealed — a pair of brothers Smollett had befriended — he suddenly declined the opportunity to press charges, instead telling investigators he knew the two men and felt bad for them.

Consider for a moment that, particularly in light of the increasing evidence the whole ordeal was an elaborate hoax, Smollett appeared perfectly willing to let two unknown individuals take the fall for his staged crime.

Had the two men arrested by law enforcement not been Smollett’s friends, the actor may very well have stood by while those innocent individuals were charged, prosecuted and sent to jail for a crime that never even occurred.

While the police investigation would likely have ultimately cleared those innocent individuals prior to them serving any real time, the same cannot be easily said for how those wrongly framed people would have fared in the court of public opinion, given the media’s current circus-like state of affairs and repeated rushes to judgement before all facts in a case have emerged.

But that was far from the only major revelation provided to TMZ by its law enforcement sources, as it was also reported that Smollett’s case will likely be presented to a grand jury as soon as next week.

If that is indeed the case, Smollett could soon be facing charges of filing a false report with the police, not to mention wasting precious and limited law enforcement resources to investigate what increasingly appears to be a non-existent crime.

The law enforcement sources also told TMZ that the two brothers who claim to have been hired by Smollett to stage the attack are being kept under the watchful eye of the police somewhere in downtown Chicago. Specifically, the police are watching to ensure Smollett doesn’t attempt to make contact with those two men.

According to TMZ, the sources also revealed that in the course of the search of the brothers’ apartment, authorities seized magazines from which pages had been torn out. There is a possibility that those magazine pages were used to cut out the letters that were pasted to create a threatening letter Smollett claimed to have received about a week prior to the alleged attack, meaning the letter could have been a hoax as well.

On top of all of that, TMZ reported that its sources said police had been highly skeptical and suspicious of Smollett’s claims from the very start, largely due to a number of “red flags” that were immediately noticed.

First and foremost among those was Smollett’s apparent knowledge of the location of various surveillance cameras in the area of the alleged attack, which he had pointed out to investigators when taken to the scene of the purported crime. The only problem was, the camera that Smollett had directly pointed to — which he seemed to believe had caught the assault on video — was pointed in the opposite direction.

Another significant red flag in the case, according to TMZ, was Smollett’s claim that the two assailants had shouted “This is MAGA country” as they assaulted him, an obvious reference to President Donald Trump — whom Smollett has publicly criticized — and his famed “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

RELATED: Coronavirus Silver Lining: Playboy Magazine's Print Edition Is No More

Also, Smollett’s television show is the story of a hip hop music mogul and his warring family. Not the normal entertainment fare that could be expected in conservative Republican circles.

According to TMZ, one of its sources said bluntly, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

In addition to all of that, the sources reported that the movement of the two brothers on the night of the incident had been tracked by the police via surveillance cameras, including their use of two separate vehicles — either taxi cabs or a rideshare — on their journey home. TMZ reported that one source described the action as being “almost like a bad spy movie.”

In the end, this looks like little more than a lame plot concocted by Smollett to garner attention and sympathy while smearing Trump and his supporters.

But Smollett’s story is rapidly unraveling now, and the fact that he appeared willing to let complete strangers receive the blame for his hateful hoax means he deserves no sympathy whatsoever, but should instead serve the same sort of sentence they would have received if found guilty of the alleged hate crime.

Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two men arrested last week and released without charges amid reports they were paid by Empire actor Jussie Smollett to stage an alleged hate crime, were scheduled to testify before a Cook County grand jury today but their testimony was postponed because of “new evidence” presented by Smollett’s lawyers, according to CBS Chicago. The network also reports that new search warrants have been authorized, but those were not specified.

In related news, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the investigation into the attack, PBS News Hour reported.

Said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton: “Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.”

In other related news, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement responding to reports that Smollett’s Empire scenes had been cut in the wake of developments in the case surrounding the alleged attack.

Smollett’s brother Jocqui and his sister Jurnee share a quote attributed to Malcolm X on Instagram criticizing the media for their handling of the alleged incident.

The quote: “This is the media, an irresponsible media. It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal. If you aren’t careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx on Tuesday recused herself from the investigation, and offered a one-sentence explanation via a rep: ""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case."" The Chicago Tribune notes that no further information has been provided about the witnesses or Foxx's relationship to them; the announcement came hours after the two brothers who were originally arrested in the case, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, spoke with prosecutors and detectives at the courthouse.

Reuters takes a look at what could happen if the alleged attack on Smollett turns out to have been staged, and it's not great. A felony charge of falsifying a police report has a possible sentence of one to three years in prison; if Smollett had a hand in the threatening letter that was mailed to the Empire set a week before the alleged attack, a federal mail fraud charge is also possible. It turns out Smollett has been charged with crimes in the past. NBC News received confirmation from the LA City Attorney's office that in 2007 Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license, and providing false info and was sentenced to probation. Per the criminal complaint against him, Smollett allegedly gave his younger brother's name upon being pulled over and signed a false name on his promise to appear in court, reports the AP. (Sources say Smollett was not happy with the reaction to the aforementioned letter.)

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor’s report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

“Empire” is on hiatus and scheduled to resume new episodes on March 13. A Fox spokeswoman said nine episodes remain in this season, the show’s fifth, and filming is complete on all but two.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had “shifted” after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

The studio statement comes one day after social media lit up with reports that the series was allegedly cutting Smollet’s scenes, curtailing his screen time or writing him off the hugely successful series.

On Valentine’s Day, Fox issued an initial statement on Smollett, throwing its full support behind the actor:

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett, who is gay, and his sources in a TMZ report alleged that his attackers yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him and told him, “This is MAGA country.” Chicago Police later arrested two Nigerian brothers in connection with the alleged incident and now believe that Smollett may have paid the two men to stage the attack.

Smollett reportedly auditioned for a play in New York City the day before, which featured a plot almost identical to the “hate crime” Smollett alleges occurred. Smollett has continued to stick by his original story of events, and has denied allegations of a hoax.

A police spokesman said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

The spokesman says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives planned to interview the person Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor is angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich on Jan. 29, about 2 a.m., near his home downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday, police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for about 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. The police spokesman said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

Smollett launched a media firestorm at the end of last month when he claimed he was assaulted by two individuals who shouted “this is MAGA country” and had a noose placed around his neck.

However, police are now seriously investigating evidence which suggests Smollett paid Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to stage the incident.

Should Smollett be found guilty of filing a false police report having staged the attack himself, the Empire actor could face several years in prison.

“If it is determined that a person lied to police about a crime that was committed, they could be charged with a Class 4 Felony ‘Disorderly conduct,’” Weisberg told HollywoodLife.

“This is charged where a person reports to police that an offense took place when they knew at the time of the report that no crimes was actually committed,” he added, noting that the charge “carries a possibility of one to three years in prison,” in addition to a “fine up to $25,000.”

Federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge against Smollett if it turns out that he had a role in creating a letter sent to the Empire studios that contained homophobic slurs and white powder that turned out to be aspirin.

Aside from jail time, the broad consensus is that Smollett’s career will be completely ruined should the allegations against him be proven accurate.

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

Police questioned Nigerian-born brothers Ola and Abel Osundario earlier this week in connection with the January 29 attack. Empire star Smollett claims he was beaten and doused in chemicals by masked men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs. Smollett also alleges his attackers tied a rope around his neck. Video footage of the attack has confirmed the presence of the Osundario brothers at the scene, though the siblings reportedly told police that Smollett paid them to fake the attack.

Police searched the home of the Osundario brothers and discovered bleach, rope and masks believed to have been used in the attack. The two brothers, however, contend that Smollett paid them to organize the assault as a publicity stunt. They also claim to have sent threatening letters to Smollett via the Empire production offices. Ola Osundario also once appeared in an episode of Empire in a bit part.

Police have also subpoenaed Smollett’s phone and financial records as part of the investigation. The 36-year-old actor has denied that the attack was faked, though he refused to consent to a second police interview. The Fox network and producers of Empire have repeatedly said they believe the actor’s account of the attack, though Fox refused to comment on rumors that Smollett’s role had been all but deleted from the remaining episodes of the Empire season."

By Lauren Victoria Burke, NNPA Newswire Contributor

On the night of February 16, the Chicago Police Department announced that their investigation into the alleged hate attack on actor Jussie Smollett had “shifted.” The actor was allegedly attacked by two men in the early morning hours of January 29 in Chicago. Smollett has been a star on the FOX Television show “Empire.”

On February 17, an attorney for Smollett said he the actor was “angered and devastated by recent reports” stating that the police were changing their theory of the case to the direction of an “orchestrated” hate attack. Unsubstantiated rumors swirled that the two suspects arrested in the crime provided evidence to the investigators that contributed to the change in direction on the part of the investigators.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” he added.

Smollett’s response to rumor that the attack was staged was pointed.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” Smollett stated through his attorneys.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continues. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Chicago Police spokesman Guglielmi told reporters. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added.

Several reports claim that Smollett offered to pay two Nigerian models, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, $4,000 to stage the January 29 assault. Those reports are unconfirmed."

The saga of Empire star Jussie Smollett is still playing out but, for now one thing is clear: Fox isn’t dismissing the actor from their show.

Following reports that some of Smollett’s scenes this week are being trimmed down in the midst of an investigation into an attack — and allegations that it may have been staged — studio 20th Century Fox TV released a new statement (via Variety). In it, they praise the actor’s work on the show’s set and reiterate that their stance towards the actor has not changed:

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

The studio is taken an innocent-until-proven-guilty approach to the case, and we imagine that there is a certain degree of flux here depending on what happens over the course of the next several weeks. Even if he does remain a part of the show, his work schedule could get rather complicated as Chicago police are reportedly looking to question the actor further about his role in the aforementioned incident, especially in the light of recent events. The police have a difficult challenge with this case, working to filter out misinformation and false tips. There is also another complicated question worth wondering — why would Smollett risk being found out, and risk his career, just to arrange what would amount to a violent political stunt? There are so many questions that still need to be asked about both methodology and intent.

We know that Smollett has brought on board famed attorney Mark Geragos for his case, and that’s a pretty big deal given his recent work in Colin Kaepernick’s collusion case. If you are bringing on board a legal expert of this stature, there’s a reasonably good chance that you are bracing for whatever is thrown your way. This is something that we’re going to examine further over the weeks ahead, given that it’s pretty darn clear at this point that this case is far from over.

Meanwhile, the show does have to go on for Empire, which will return to fox with new episodes next month. Over the weeks ahead we are expecting to see a lot of complicated stories related to the Lyon family, including Jamal, and potentially a big character death at some point before the end of the season. If Fox is insisting that they are not writing out Smollett, does that mean that he will make it through the season okay?

One of the reporters recently appeared on a few Fox News shows and responded to questions on why he went on shows like Hannity and The Ingraham Angle.

Fox 32 Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel said those were the only shows to invite him on:

Nader Issa, a reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times, and Adrienne Samuels Gibbs, who has been writing on the story for Forbes, have also been invited to CNN:

With the story taking such a drastic shift from when it first broke, some have asked why these press people are not receiving as much attention as one would think.

CNN’s Brian Stelter blamed it on how “Local stations frequently say no to our booking requests” and the process is “very complicated for reasons that will probably bore you”:

CHICAGO - The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

7:50 p.m.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say they will mount an ""aggressive defence"" of the ""Empire"" actor after he was charged with making a false report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson say in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence... ""

It did not say where Smollett is and when he might turn himself in to police.

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting an attack on Jan. 29. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

6:55 p.m.

Chicago police say 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State's Attorney's office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

6:45 p.m.

An attorney representing two brothers implicated in the alleged scheme by 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett to file a false police report in what he's said was an attack by masked men in Chicago last month says the two testified before a grand jury for a total of 2 1/2 hours and that they did take money from Smollett.

Gloria Schmidt told reporters at the Chicago courthouse after Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo appeared before the grand jury on Wednesday that the two did not testify as part of any plea deal with prosecutors and said that the two were not granted any immunity from prosecution.

She said there was a point where the account of the men needed to be told and that they ""manned up and said, 'We're gonna correct this.'""

The testimony came after the brothers were released from custody by police who said they were no longer suspects. Their testimony came the same day that police department said that Smollett is now considered a suspect for ""filing a false police report"" and that the case has been referred to a grand jury

4:55 p.m.

A spokeswoman says Chicago's top prosecutor recused herself from the Jussie Smollett investigation because she had had conversations with one of the ""Empire"" actor's family members and ""facilitated a connection"" with the police department.

Tandra Simonton said Wednesday that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case last week ""out of an abundance of caution."" The move was announced Tuesday.

Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

A police official says Smollett is suspected of lying about the attack and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday afternoon.

Smollett has repeated stood by his account. The black and gay actor told police that two masked men attacked him early on Jan. 29 and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett's lawyers didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.

4:30 p.m.

A police official says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect ""for filing a false police report"" and that detectives are presenting the case against him to a grand jury.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn't find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had ""shifted"" the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

3:10 p.m.

A police official says lawyers for Jussie Smollett are meeting with prosecutors and police investigators about the reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor late last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the meeting was taking place Wednesday afternoon. He declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for Smollett's phone and bank records.

Chicago police say ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

An attorney representing two brothers implicated in the alleged scheme by ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett to file a false police report in what he’s said was an attack by masked men in Chicago last month says the two testified before a grand jury for a total of 2 ½ hours and that they did take money from Smollett.

Gloria Schmidt told reporters at the Chicago courthouse after Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo appeared before the grand jury on Wednesday that the two did not testify as part of any plea deal with prosecutors and said that the two were not granted any immunity from prosecution.

She said there was a point where the account of the men needed to be told and that they “manned up and said, ‘We’re gonna correct this.'”

The testimony came after the brothers were released from custody by police who said they were no longer suspects. Their testimony came the same day that police department said that Smollett is now considered a suspect for “filing a false police report” and that the case has been referred to a grand jury

A spokeswoman says Chicago’s top prosecutor recused herself from the Jussie Smollett investigation because she had had conversations with one of the “Empire” actor’s family members and “facilitated a connection” with the police department.

Tandra Simonton said Wednesday that Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case last week “out of an abundance of caution.” The move was announced Tuesday.

Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

A police official says Smollett is suspected of lying about the attack and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday afternoon.

Smollett has repeated stood by his account. The black and gay actor told police that two masked men attacked him early on Jan. 29 and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett’s lawyers didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Fox Television says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and it has reiterated that he’s not being written out of the show.

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor’s report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had “shifted” after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

6:40 a.m.

Chicago police say they’ve dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday that a person in the building reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. But he says video evidence shows the report isn’t credible.

Guglielmi says the two brothers meet with investigators Tuesday. There was no immediate word on what they discussed.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

On Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Former Uptown Entertainment president Andre Harrell—the man responsible for Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, and Heavy D—is taking over the legendary label and promising to bring the noise. But can he fight through the nostalgia and lead Motown into the 21st century? By Anthony DeCurtis. Photographs by Dana Lixenberg

""You know how Jeffrey Katzenberg became Disney? That's what I want to do. Like, how you felt Jeffrey had a passion about Disney—his Mickey Mouse watches, Disney sweatshirt, Disney tie. That's what I'm talking about. I will be at the Motown Cafe. I'll make Motown ties, watch­es, sweatshirts. I intend to make Motown the black Disney,"" Andre Harrell says with a smile. ""You might as well start calling me Walt.""

Harrell, 35, is obviously a man with a plan. Good thing, too. He's stepping into one of the most vis­ible jobs in the entertainment industry: president and CEO of Motown Records. ""It's always been a dream of mine to head up Motown,"" he says.

Yet the lofty position confronts Harrell with a critical challenge. Motown has fallen far from what it once was. Aside from the monumental Boyz II Men, Motown has increasingly become a sound­track for nostalgia, much more redolent of the past than the present. It's so hard to say good-bye to yesterday, indeed. Harrell, a product of the hip hop generation, knows his job is to introduce Mo­town—music, television, film, video, animation, and new media—to tomorrow.

A Bronx native, he got his start in the early '8os as half of the rap duo Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. (He was Dr. Jekyll.) After moving over to the business side of the business, he hooked up with rap mogul Russell Simmons and soon landed a top spot at Simmons's company, Rush Communications, where he worked with the likes of Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J, and Whodini.

Harrell stepped out on his own in 1986, when he launched his own label, Uptown Entertain­ment, as part of a joint venture with MCA. At Uptown, Harrell defined a contemporary R&B sound for the hip hop age, bringing the world Guy, Heavy D, Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Al B. Sure!, Father MC, and most recently, Soul for Real (with whom he had his first No. 1 pop hit, ""Candy Rain""). He produced the 1991 film Strictly Business, and he coproduces the hit Fox series New York Undercover.

Successful as the artists on his label proved to be, Harrell has felt constrained in his efforts to make them pop superstars, both by his arrange­ment with Uptown's parent company, MCA, and by the troubling racial politics of the music busi­ness in general. Moving to Motown, which is now based in Los Angeles and owned by PolyGram, presents Harrell with the opportunity to put at least some of these issues behind him. At Motown, Harrell says, he'll have more people, more prerogative, more punch.

Seated on a couch in the living room of his Upper West Side New York apartment, dressed simply in a black shirt and white slacks, Harrell focused squarely through his blue shades on what must be done. A framed photo of a serious-looking Harrell arm-in-arm with Mickey Mouse sat on an end table.

Clearly a man who enjoys control, Harrell was soft-spoken and intent. He didn't want to be mis­understood. ""Am I correct?"" he would ask. ""Do you follow me?"" He leaned forward, and his voice rose with passion as he discussed his frustrations with MCA. Otherwise, he slipped back into the pil­lows of his sofa and spoke as if he was envisioning his future life in a dream.

Harrell knows he has as much on the line as Motown, if not more. All eyes will be on him. It's one thing to say you would've done something if only you'd gotten the chance. It's quite another to get the chance and have to do it.

""Every record has gotta be right,"" he said. ""I'm trying to sign stars. I'm not gonna have wack-juice on me. Never did, never will.""

What has Motown meant to you over the years? When was the first time you knew what it was?

The first true Motown experience I had was when the Jackson 5 were on the Ed Sullivan Show. I think it might've been, like, 1969, '70. They sang ""Stand!"" and ""I Want You Back."" I had never seen a black teenager on television—it was incredible. After that, I realized who the Motown artists were. My parents listened to them: the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, the Temptations.

What did the company represent for you?

Motown has always been the epitome of black excellence and artistry. Stevie sang about love in the most sensitive way, as well as telling about the plight of his people. Marvin sang about the plight of his people and his internal fight, but he sang about love in a very sexy way. They were major influences.

Speaking of Stevie Wonder, he made a strong album last year and nothing happened with it. Can Motown sell a Stevie Wonder record in this day and age?

The Four Tops, the Temps, and, especially, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross—these are national trea­sures. You have to treat them like events. Stevie Wonder, he's someone I would do an Unplugged with. Or a couple of years ago, it was Stevie's 3oth anniversary in show business. You could have got­ten Stevie Wonder a television special. We could have had artists pay tribute to him—pop artists, rock artists, R&B artists, rap artists, everybody could have participated. And there's probably no other female, black or white, who's as fabulous as Diana Ross, who epitomizes the glamour and excitement of a star diva.

What about new directions? What makes Motown happen in the '9os?

Motown has to become the lifestyle label for the times that the active record-buying audience—the audience who's 15 to 3o—is living in. One of the ways you do this is by putting out records that are in the groove that that audience is living in. Like if Mary J. Blige was a Motown artist, Motown would have some of her imaging on it. It's that young, hip hop—soul, Generation X energy. Same thing if Jodeci was on the label. Back in the day, Motown talked to everybody in the ghetto—and it talked to the rest of the world too.

""WHEN YOU THINK OF MOTOWN NOW, YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF ANDRE HARRELL. I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR MOTOWN, I'M GONNA BE MOTOWN.""

That sounds like the philosophy you espoused at Uptown.

The thing that [Motown founder] Berry Gordy led the way with is the idea that the label head becomes the image of the label. Myself, I allowed whatever celebri­ty occurred in my career to happen through the artists. I was so consistent with the kinds of artists who were on my label, after a while, it was, like, ""Who's behind all this?"" I was behind it.

Going into Motown, my plan is this: When you think of Motown now, you're gonna think of Andre Harrell. I'm not gonna work for Motown, I'm gonna be Motown—in the way I dress, the records I put out, the causes I choose to get involved in, the artists from the past, the artists who are there now, and the artists in the future. Like I lived Uptown Records, I'm gonna live Motown Records.

But you, Russell Simmons, Sean .""Puffy"" Combs—and Berry Gordy before you—are entrepreneurs. You're identified with the companies you founded. With this, you're stepping into something—

—that's already existing. I'm gonna be Motown for this generation of young-adult record buyers. Motown was the blueprint. Berry Gordy was the blueprint for what I became.

Were you conflicted about leaving Uptown?

I had tremendous conflict. It was like I was walking away from my works of art. There will never be another Mary J. Blige—it's rare to find a queen. There will nev­er be another Jodeci. There'll never be another Heavy D. But I have to go, because Motown gives me the power I need to go to the next level. I have to make African-American superstars. At Uptown, I was able to make black icons, but they were icons only to black people.

[I was] trying to grow Uptown, to have indepen­dence, to be able to say, ""This act is getting ready to be a worldwide star, and I'm gonna take all my resources, and we're gonna march to this one beat."" I was trying to do that for nine years. Between me and the corpora­tion, I could never get it to happen.

In terms of support from MCA?

I think MCA, after a period, wanted some of these things to happen. For whatever reasons, though, the execution between the two sides never worked. The biggest record I ever had was Jodeci's [1991] Forever My Lady—3 million.

When [Arista president] Clive Davis got in the game, I felt myself shrinking. Once he got in business with LaFace [L.A. Reid and Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds] and [Dallas Austin's] Rowdy Records and Puffy [Bad Boy Entertainment], Davis's commitment and his exe­cution were taking those artists where I wanted my artists to go. I wanted Mary J. Blige to sell the 7 million that Toni Braxton did.

Jodeci came to me because I had Al B. Sure! So they figured, ""He knows how to do this. We wanna be down with him."" They drove 13 hours, sat in my lobby for eight hours just to meet me. Now, I feel like, with Arista being involved with LaFace and the other labels, they sold 7 million Toni Braxtons. They sold 6 million TLCs. I'm, like, if I can't sell these kinds of records, I'm gonna slowly shrink. I was catching heat from my artists, who wanted that kind of stature. I would bring that frustra­tion to MCA, and we couldn't seem to come to terms.

Was the idea, ""Well, Andre's doing fine. He's doing a cou­ple of million here, a couple of million there. He's covered. Were gonna invest somewhere else""?

I felt like a figurehead. I had all this energy around me—like, I was the Man. I was the founder and chairman of Uptown Records, a major, culturally influen­tial entertainment company for African-Americans in the '9os. But I didn't feel like the Man, because I could­n't put my finger on the button that would really make it happen. I don't want to be in that position anymore. I need to have more control. I need to be responsible for the big picture. And being at Motown positions me to create a truly black pop company. I got a film divi­sion, a television division. I got green-light power for small movies. I don't have to ask anybody.

What are your plans with Gordy?

We're gonna do a series of commercials—print and television. He endorses me. We spoke yesterday for about an hour, and he said, ""Any advice I can give you about where we go from here, feel free to call me."" We're gonna spend time together and talk about his history with the elder stars. I feel as if I've had a tremendous amount of experience working with stars' drama and ego, but we're talking a whole 'nother level of stars. I've never built a superstar. There're superstars at this house.

How do you build superstars?

If black stars are gonna have a shot at becoming pop stars, it's gonna be because the chairman of the company is committed to them—and because their music is his personal taste. That's what I'm bringing to black music, to black musical stars. Not just their art form but their plight as African-American men and women.

What you're describing is a role that black executives play, but aren't they often frustrated in their attempts to rise at most record companies?

I can't talk about it enough, how few black execu­tives get to control their playing field. Black music is becoming the music of the popular culture. Because of that, companies are repositioning their priorities and trying to get in the game. But as black music becomes more important, there should be more black presidents and black chairmen. As soon as the black executive's artist reaches platinum, suddenly the artist and man­ager have to deal with the president of the corporation, because he controls the priorities at pop radio. The black executive becomes obsolete. As his music gets bigger his power diminishes. He's more or less told, ""Go find the next act and establish it.""

It's an emphasis on the creative—

—as opposed to the business. That's why young black executives don't get to become the old chairmen—the wise men who've seen it and done it. They get to stay hot black executives so long as their instincts are hot. But this is a lifestyle business—only a few of us, black or white, are going to be cool enough to have great in­stincts our whole career.

The black executive is not given the opportunity to become the business and the music. Why not? Why shouldn't he be the one that everybody reports to? When you get an act that sells 5 million—at a major compa­ny—the black executive's out of the room. But when there's some sort of problem, the major label looks at the black executive: ""Why can't you handle this act?"" When the artist hires a violent manager and the violent manager is coming up to the record company, the label's, like, ""How did it get to this?"" How? Because they [the white executives] couldn't see it coming. Because they re not sensitive to his issues. By then the relation­ship between the record company and the artist is dys­functional. And then the black executive gets blamed and fired. But they created the monster.

When I had the artist, I talked to his mother, his girl­friend, his babies' mother with the two children, dealt with his drug counselor, and whatever other dysfunc­tional Generation X problems he has. He'd call me late at night.

But he feels like they're just businesspeople. And they don't understand. And they might be racist. He's comin' with all that energy. Even if they like him as a person, he still has goo years of issues he has to get over to accept them. And they have a lot of work to do to gain his trust and respect.

So what are your immediate plans?

I will be moving to Beverly Hills. I'll have a house out there for a 12-to-18-month period, and I'll be bicoastal between the New York and L.A. offices. Then I'm moving the company to New York. I'm going to have a satellite office in Atlanta—A&R-oriented. I'm going to build a recording studio in New York, Motown Studios.

Any new musical directions?

The sound I'm going for now is soul. I'm looking for voices that sound like 400 years of slavery and then some. I'm looking for that inspirational, take-us-out­-of-our-plight, Aretha Franklin, Bill Withers, Al Green voice. I'm looking to build those kinds of stars now.

What about the younger acts on Motown? Have you met with Boyz II Men?

No. Those meetings will come after I execute the deal. Boyz II Men are the biggest group I've ever seen. I don't know what I'm bringing to the party except to keep them from goin' crazy from the level of success they've had. They probably need a break, a little time out to lead their personal lives. Outside of that, that for­mula is working. Queen Latifah, I'd like to bring her record sales up to match her celebrity. Zhané I'd like to give a little bit more image. I'm gonna bring Johnny Gill back—he had a fabulous first album. And I'm excit­ed about working with Michael Bivins. He's tremen­dously talented, and if he and I get together, we can real­ly do some important things.

Are you apprehensive?

I got a lot of work to do. But no problems. Making hits is not a problem. I'll be making some noise real quick. And I ain't gonna stop makin' noise until I'm done.

Nothing says white privilege like being a self-satisfied asshole wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and impeding the path of a Native American activist; and then, when called out on said assholishness , suing the billionaire owner of the Washington Post (when every damn paper in America wrote about that story) for $250 million.

But, as the imaginary assailants told Jussie Smollett, “MAGA country, bitch!”

The family of the Kentucky teen whose smug mug went viral as he encountered a Native America protestor on the Lincoln Memorial in January has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Washington Post looking for some $250 million in damages.

According to the lawsuit, which has been viewed by the Post, 16-year-old Nicholas Sandmann, believes that he was “targeted and bullied” by the newspaper in order to embarrass President Trump.

“In a span of three days in January of this year commencing on January 19, the Post engaged in a modern-day form of McCarthyism by competing with CNN and NBC, among others, to claim leadership of a mainstream and social media mob of bullies which attacked, vilified, and threatened Nicholas Sandmann, an innocent secondary school child,” reads the complaint.

It added, “The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters of the President.”

The lawsuit, which was filed by Sandmann’s parents, Ted and Julie, on their son’s behalf, believes that the teen is owed $250 million for ruining his lily white name, which is quadruple the price gazillionaire Jeff Bezos paid for the newspaper in 2013.

Of course, the president, who has always been jealous of Bezos for actually working to become a legitimate quintuple trizillionaire , voiced his support for the lawsuit because that’s extremely presidential and unbiased.

“Go get them Nick . Fake News!” Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning presumably after eating a live fawn with his bare hands before soaking in sherbet extract and laying in his tanning bed for six hours.

The complaint—which includes five attorneys because everybody is trying to eat off this case— claims that the Post published seven articles that were “false and defamatory.”

From the Post:

According to the allegations made in the complaint, Nicholas Sandmann and his classmates were waiting for a bus at the Lincoln Memorial after attending the March for Life rally on the Mall when a group of African American men who call themselves Hebrew Israelites began yelling racial epithets at them. The high school group began a series of school sports chants in response, the complaint said. Phillips, a self-described Native American activist who was on the Mall that day for the Indigenous Peoples March, has said he was walking toward the Lincoln Memorial when he encountered the Covington group. He was chanting and beating a small drum when he came face to face with Sandmann. The Sandmanns’ suit asserts that the newspaper “bullied” Sandmann in its reporting “because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red ‘Make America Great Again’ souvenir cap.” It calls Phillips “a phony war hero [who] was too intimidated by the unruly Hebrew Israelites to approach them, the true troublemakers, and instead chose to focus on a group of innocent children.”

A Post spokeswoman, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said in response to the suit, “We are reviewing a copy of the lawsuit, and we plan to mount a vigorous defense.”



Also, when in doubt, blame the Hebrew Israelites.

Also, am I the only one that thinks $250 million is a little low for allegedly besmirching the good white name of a Kentucky teen?"

Police couldn’t find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had “shifted” the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

Fox Television says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and it has reiterated that he’s not being written out of the show.

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor’s report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had “shifted” after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

Chicago police say they’ve dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday that a person in the building reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. But he says video evidence shows the report isn’t credible.

Guglielmi says the two brothers meet with investigators Tuesday. There was no immediate word on what they discussed.

Chicago police are still investigating the physical assault Smollett reported to them on Jan. 29. Earlier this week, CNN reported that Chicago PD now believe Smollett might have paid two brothers to stage the attack.

Last week, Fox released the following statement on Smollett:

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

The studio hadn’t said anything publicly between now and then.

On Wednesday, a person with knowledge of “Empire” production told TheWrap that Smollett’s scenes for the rest of the ongoing Season 5 are being trimmed. Scenes that Smollett had already shot will not be edited out of episodes that have wrapped production, however.

According to TMZ, which first reported the news of changes to Jamal’s remaining arc this year, Smollett had nine scenes and a “big musical number” in this season’s second-to-last episode. Five of those scenes have now been cut, along with the musical number. And for those other four scenes that remain, they have been rewritten to focus more on an ensemble than just Smollett.

“Multiple revisions” have been made to the episode’s script in just the last 24 hours, per TMZ.

“Empire” returns from its winter hiatus on March 13. Production started up again on Tuesday in Chicago."

NBC News reports, based on information confirmed by the L.A. City Attorney’s Office, that Smollett was arrested on suspicion of DUI, and pleaded no contest that charge and additional charges of providing false statements to law enforcement and driving without a license.

According to the New York Post, Smollet reportedly gave the officer who stopped him his brother’s name instead of his own, and later used a false name on a written promise to appear in court. He was initially charged with false impersonation but reportedly had the charge reduced to providing false statements,

The L.A. City Attorney’s spokesperson told NBC News that Smollett was sentenced to two years probation and a choice between jail or a fine. The report does not specify which he chose.

Law enforcement sources told the news outlet that Chicago police have requested information about the 2007 arrest from Los Angeles authorities.

Smollett reported to police that he had been assaulted in the early morning hours of January 29 in Chicago by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck, and poured a chemical, possibly, bleach on him. But multiple reports have indicated that Smollett may have orchestrated that attack; and law enforcement sources have said he paid the two men who purportedly assaulted him. The two brothers were arrested last week upon their return from a brief trip to Nigeria, and have since been released, as they reportedly continue to cooperate with police.

Chicago police are reportedly focusing the investigation on a possible false report, according to NBC News, and have not said they consider Smollett a suspect or a victim. They are reportedly seeking to question him again, but it is unclear if Smollett has made arrangements to meet with them."

CHICAGO - The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

7:50 p.m.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say they will mount an ""aggressive defence"" of the ""Empire"" actor after he was charged with making a false report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson say in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence... ""

It did not say where Smollett is and when he might turn himself in to police.

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting an attack on Jan. 29. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

6:55 p.m.

Chicago police say 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State's Attorney's office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

6:45 p.m.

An attorney representing two brothers implicated in the alleged scheme by 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett to file a false police report in what he's said was an attack by masked men in Chicago last month says the two testified before a grand jury for a total of 2 1/2 hours and that they did take money from Smollett.

Gloria Schmidt told reporters at the Chicago courthouse after Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo appeared before the grand jury on Wednesday that the two did not testify as part of any plea deal with prosecutors and said that the two were not granted any immunity from prosecution.

She said there was a point where the account of the men needed to be told and that they ""manned up and said, 'We're gonna correct this.'""

The testimony came after the brothers were released from custody by police who said they were no longer suspects. Their testimony came the same day that police department said that Smollett is now considered a suspect for ""filing a false police report"" and that the case has been referred to a grand jury

4:55 p.m.

A spokeswoman says Chicago's top prosecutor recused herself from the Jussie Smollett investigation because she had had conversations with one of the ""Empire"" actor's family members and ""facilitated a connection"" with the police department.

Tandra Simonton said Wednesday that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case last week ""out of an abundance of caution."" The move was announced Tuesday.

Foxx's first assistant, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

A police official says Smollett is suspected of lying about the attack and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday afternoon.

Smollett has repeated stood by his account. The black and gay actor told police that two masked men attacked him early on Jan. 29 and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett's lawyers didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.

4:30 p.m.

A police official says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect ""for filing a false police report"" and that detectives are presenting the case against him to a grand jury.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn't find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had ""shifted"" the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

3:10 p.m.

A police official says lawyers for Jussie Smollett are meeting with prosecutors and police investigators about the reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor late last month.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the meeting was taking place Wednesday afternoon. He declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for Smollett's phone and bank records.

""Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by #ChicagoPolice for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on Twitter.

Chicago police detectives presente evidence to a Cook County grand jury Wednesday afternoon, according to Guglielmi.

The actor told police last month he was attacked in Chicago in the early hours of the morning by two masked men who shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs."" Police said Smollett described the assailants punching him in the face, pouring a chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

Police investigated the attack as a ""possible hate crime,"" and outrage online was swift and loud.

Smollett's status as a victim began to shift last weekend after police arrested and interviewed two brothers who were originally identified as suspects after turning up in surveillance footage.

The men told detectives that Smollett, who employed one as a personal trainer, paid them to stage the assault. A search warrant for their residences also turned up a receipt for the rope.

Chicago Police requested another interview with Smollett, and earlier Wednesday, Smollett's legal team met with prosecutors and detectives for a follow-up.

Guglielmi told the Associated Press he was uncertain what was discussed at the meeting. He also declined to confirm reports that subpoenas had been issued for the actor’s phone and bank records. Smollett's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, declined to comment on the meetings.

The meetings came the same day that celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos officially joined the ""Empire"" actor's legal team.

Pugh's office told USA TODAY that he and Henderson will remain Smollett's primary attorneys and Geragos, who has represented singer Chris Brown and actress Winona Ryder, will assist them.

Fox, the network behind ""Empire,"" reiterated its support for the actor earlier Wednesday, telling USA TODAY, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""

The network's second public statement followed a Deadline report that his role was being scaled back while the Chicago Police Department investigates the possibility that the actor, who is black and gay, orchestrated last month's assault, which was originally characterized as a possible hate crime.

Meanwhile, it was reported Tuesday that the FBI is investigating whether Smollett had any role in a threatening letter addressed to him and containing a white powder later revealed to be pain medication. The envelope was received at the Fox studio in Chicago which serves as the show's production base exactly one week before Smollett reported being assaulted on Jan. 29 in the Streeterville neighborhood.

Although the FBI wouldn't confirm the news, a federal government official who has been briefed but not authorized to comment on the investigation told USA TODAY that the agency's new inquiry is still in the preliminary stages.

Jussie Smollett case: FBI investigates whetheractor had any role inthreatening letter

Also on Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced she was recusing herself from the investigation.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for Foxx, said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Simonton, said that Foxx acted as a go-between for police after Smollett reported that he had been assaulted.

""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State’s Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,” Simonton said in a statement. “Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State’s Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.”

In a lengthy interview with “Good Morning America” last week, Smollett told Robin Roberts that he believed the letter was linked to the alleged attack.

He said the letter “had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said 'Smollett, Jussie you will die,' "" he said, adding that in the return address area was simply listed as said ""MAGA.""

The actor has maintained that he was attacked in Chicago in the early hours of Jan. 29 by two masked men who shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs."" Police said Smollett described the assailants punching him in the face, pouring a chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

Last week, a pair of brothers of Nigerian descent in their late 20s who reside in Chicago told detectives that they were paid to stage the attack, a person familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY.

Police also found records in the Chicago home of one of the men that showed they purchased rope from a hardware store that was used in the alleged attack, the source said.

The brothers were released Friday with police citing new evidence in the case. They were not charged. Police spokesman Tom Ahern said the brothers met with police and prosecutors Tuesday. They did not testify before a grand jury.

In a statement issued late Saturday, the actor's attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, confirmed to USA TODAY that the star knew the brothers and employed one as his personal trainer.

Smollett was ""angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his attorneys said in a statement.

Pugh and Henderson added, ""He has been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo — who admitted Smollett paid them to pull off the attack, law enforcement sources said — were moments away from testifying to a Cook County grand jury before Smollett's defense team persuaded prosecutors to postpone the testimony due to new evidence, the station said.

The testimony would have been the first step toward indicting Smollett for filing a false police report, WBBM reported.

The brothers said they were paid $3,500 to pour a chemical on the actor, place a rope around his neck, and yell racist and homophobic slurs, the station said, adding that two sources indicated the brothers used a ride share vehicle to get to the Streeterville neighborhood and were caught on camera appearing nervous.

WBBM sources also said one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett's request — which the actor paid for — from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood over the weekend of Jan. 25.

More from the station:



Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.



The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.

What else?

It's recently surfaced that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to misdemeanor charges of DUI, driving without a license, and providing false information to a police officer, including false impersonation.



In addition, federal investigators are looking into whether Smollett is responsible for a threatening letter addressed to him and sent to the Chicago studio for ""Empire"" about a week before the alleged attack.

The brothers — one of whom has appeared on ""Empire"" while the other was reportedly Smollett's personal trainer — reportedly told authorities Smollett paid them to stage the attack after getting mad that the threatening letter didn't get as much attention as he wanted.

The brothers have since issued a public statement saying they are not racist, homophobic, or anti-Trump and are American citizens born and raised in Chicago.

Smollett's attorneys have denied the brothers' claim that he orchestrated the attack.

About a dozen search warrants have been issued in the case, WBBM said, including for Smollett's financial and phone records. The station said detectives are waiting for those records to come back."

Chicago police say ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury.

6:45 p.m.

An attorney representing two brothers implicated in the alleged scheme by ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett to file a false police report in what he’s said was an attack by masked men in Chicago last month says the two testified before a grand jury for a total of 2 ½ hours and that they did take money from Smollett.

Gloria Schmidt told reporters at the Chicago courthouse after Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo appeared before the grand jury on Wednesday that the two did not testify as part of any plea deal with prosecutors and said that the two were not granted any immunity from prosecution.

She said there was a point where the account of the men needed to be told and that they “manned up and said, ‘We’re gonna correct this.’”

The testimony came after the brothers were released from custody by police who said they were no longer suspects. Their testimony came the same day that police department said that Smollett is now considered a suspect for “filing a false police report” and that the case has been referred to a grand jury

A spokeswoman says Chicago’s top prosecutor recused herself from the Jussie Smollett investigation because she had had conversations with one of the “Empire” actor’s family members and “facilitated a connection” with the police department.

Tandra Simonton said Wednesday that Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case last week “out of an abundance of caution.” The move was announced Tuesday.

Foxx’s first assistant, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

A police official says Smollett is suspected of lying about the attack and that detectives were presenting evidence to a grand jury Wednesday afternoon.

Smollett has repeated stood by his account. The black and gay actor told police that two masked men attacked him early on Jan. 29 and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett’s lawyers didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.

A police official says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect “for filing a false police report” and that detectives are presenting the case against him to a grand jury.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted the news on Wednesday after Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and detectives.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. He says they beat him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him and looped a rope around his neck before fleeing.

Police couldn’t find surveillance video of the attack but questioned two men who were initially deemed as suspects but who were released Friday. On Saturday, Guglielmi said information from the men had “shifted” the investigation and that police want to speak to Smollett again.

Fox Television says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and it has reiterated that he’s not being written out of the show.

The statement issued Wednesday by 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment follows reports that Smollett’s role on the show was being slashed amid police investigations into the actor’s report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

The 36-year old told Chicago police that two masked men beat him, yelled homophobic and racial slurs and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. Police said Saturday that their investigation had “shifted” after they interviewed two brothers who were arrested and later released.

6:40 a.m.

Chicago police say they’ve dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator at his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday that a person in the building reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. But he says video evidence shows the report isn’t credible.

Guglielmi says the two brothers meet with investigators Tuesday. There was no immediate word on what they discussed.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay.

On Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Guest columnist

Foes of the embattled, first-term Republican president claimed he was bigoted, unethical and practiced gutter politics. Still-livid fans of his defeated opponent – a former U.S. senator who’d held high federal executive office – reviled him. Many journalists considered him a trigger-happy, racist, unqualified, neo-Fascist. This describes Donald Trump – and also Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, who won 49-state re-elections.

In 2020, Trump could win 40 states against an opponent who’s seen as an anti-gun, pro-abortion, anti-business, pro-sanctuary city, anti-taxpayer, pro-transgender, anti-cop, pro-perp, diversity-obsessed, NPR-addicted subversive. Then there’s likeability: Many of today’s best-known Democrats simply aren’t folks that most likely voters in the swing states admire. They’d love to meet President Trump. But they find Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Jerry Nadler, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker about as appealing as Jussie Smollett.

Republicans will also ensure that the radical Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez personifies the Democrats. Like Nixon and Reagan, Trump will run as America’s protector, whose defeat would empower a clueless (or conniving?) crypto-Marxist, who’d jeopardize the economy and national security, undermine U.S. culture and derail a future which, in 2020, will look pretty good.

Of our 21 presidents since 1900, five lost as incumbents. In 1912 and 1992, former Republicans running as third-party nominees siphoned off GOP votes, ousting William Howard Taft and George H.W. Bush. The Great Depression in 1932 sent Herbert Hoover packing; pardoning Nixon doomed Jerry Ford in 1976. The 1980s Iranian hostage crisis, 18.5 percent interest rates and 14 percent inflation sealed Jimmy Carter’s fate.

While Trump is often compared to Reagan, particularly as a communicator, he more resembles the ""law-and-order president,"" Nixon. His temperament, executive style, personality, demeanor, and approach to governing, campaigns, and the media are downright Nixonian. Scores of millions of likely voters believe America’s institutions are under siege; they see Trump as the fighter for whom they’ve waited for years. To them, he represents political sanity, cultural stability and a willingness to backhand those who’ve long deserved it. Nixon’s ""us versus them"" re-election themes annihilated his opponent, George McGovern; Reagan did the same to Walter Mondale.

Today, on the issues of law-and-order, abortion, national security, taxes, the Second Amendment, immigration, affirmative action, the U.S. military, education policy, veterans, deregulation and traditional values, many leftists vilify those who challenge their views. But such baseless smears will actually help Trump. Unlike Nixon, Ronald Reagan wasn’t a racist. But being so accused proved politically advantageous to them. Remember: nobody ever claimed, credibly, that John Kasich, Bob Dole, Jeb Bush, Gerald Ford, John McCain, or Mitt Romney were bigots.

But how did their presidential candidacies end? Several million voters won’t tell pollsters, co-workers, friends, neighbors, or even relatives, that they like Trump and his in-your-face, ""America first"" agenda. Union members, public employees, women, some LGBTs and other minorities, comprise this clandestine milieu.

Millions of middle-class and lower-middle-class voters will reject the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nominee, helping Republicans in several crucial swing states. Concomitantly, the most likely voters in most states favor Trump on the issues on which they’ll base their votes. While generally disapproving of Trump’s frequent tactlessness and tweets, most voters realize that choosing a chief executive isn’t like hiring a preacher.

Nixon in 1972 faced primary opposition. Trump will, as well, from former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. But like Reagan and Nixon, Trump innately understands that politics boils down to ""who gets what."" That’s one reason why he declared a national emergency to obtain funds for the border wall his base wants and America needs. For these reasons and others, the 2020 Trump-Pence ticket will win approximately 40 states with 400 electoral votes.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

FOX has doubled down on their assertion that Jussie Smollett will not be written off of Empire after doubts emerged about his attack in Chicago. “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” the network said in a statement. Their statement comes as brothers brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, the suspects in the alleged hate crime against Jussie on January 29, were set to testify before a grand jury in Chicago.

There have been multiple reports that Jussie allegedly staged the vicious attack with the brothers; one was reportedly once an extra on Empire. The actor claimed that during his alleged attack, two men yelled homophobic slurs, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him. He was able to bring himself to a local hospital, and has since recovered. Unnamed sources told ABC 7 in Chicago that the attack was staged to bring more attention to Jussie’s Empire character after he found out he was allegedly being written off. Jussie’s rep told our sister site, Variety, that these were “ridiculous rumors.”

Jussie’s case is still under investigation by Chicago police, and while he had an incredible outpouring of support by his Empire cast members, celebrities, politicians, and even President Donald Trump, it’s wavering. Cardi B said she was “disappointed” in him… and that he f**ked up Black History Month. She went on Instagram Live to slam the actor, saying, “Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s–t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because, you know … police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.”"

An intimate video of Nicole Scherzinger and her former boyfriend Lewis Hamilton was leaked online by hackers over the weekend.

On Saturday night, a short video surfaced that showed the Pussycat Dolls singer and her 34-year-old ex cuddling and kissing in bed. The video has reportedly been viewed nearly 300,000 times already!

Related: Cardi B Calls Out Jussie Smollett Over Suspicions He May Have Staged His Attack

For those who may not know, the former couple dated on-and-off for about eight years before splitting for good in 2015, but it sounds like a few determined internet trolls are hellbent on digging up private mementos of their past here.

A source tells The Sun that Nicole is worried more of her personal videos and pictures will be leaked soon too:

“Nicole wants it down. It’s hugely embarrassing and distressing for her to have something this intimate and private out there. Nicole’s very worried that more videos and pictures will be leaked in the next couple of days.”

Ugh, we can’t imagine how frustrating and scary this must be! Some things should absolutely be left private…

Right now the general consensus is that hackers leaked the clip, but no other information has surfaced about who else might have had access to the singer’s files.

“She feels hugely violated that someone’s been looking through her private pictures and is concerned this is just the start of a nightmare. She’s particularly worried as she deleted that video a long time ago, so it must have been hacked from the Cloud.”

Hmm, it sounds like Lewis isn’t being considered as a suspect here — which makes sense as he’d have just as much to lose by these sensitive docs being leaked too.

But it begs the question, what does someone have to gain by doing this aside from embarrassing an innocent person? Knock it off, trolls!

What do YOU guys think about all this? How would you handle it if your privacy was violated? Sound off in the comments (below)!

In the midst of the evolving investigation into the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement on Wednesday (Feb. 20) affirming that it stands behind the singer/actor and re-iterating that he is not, as rumored, being written out of the show.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,"" read the statement.

The affirmation came as the details about the investigation into the alleged attack on Smollett, 36, continues to change on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. The actor has said he was approached around 2:00 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his apartment in Chicago by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, who then reportedly beat him, poured an unidentified caustic liquid on him and shouted ""This is MAGA country!"", an apparent reference to Pres. Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make American Great Again.""

To date, police have found scant video footage to corroborate the attack despite arresting and later releasing two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were initially deemed suspects in the case. That designation was changed after Chicago police said over the weekend that the ""trajectory"" of the investigation had shifted, without offering any specifics. ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals [arrested and later released] questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" police said.

Police have reportedly requested a second interview with Smollett; it was unknown at press time if the actor has met with investigators again. The show of confidence from Fox came after reports that Smollett -- who plays singer Jamal Lyon on the show -- was possibly being written out of the long-running Fox musical soap opera, or was having his screen time drastically reduced in the wake of the questions about the details of the alleged attack."

While Wayne died nearly 40 years ago, the legendary actor was a No. 1 trending topic on Twitter from Monday night through Tuesday afternoon.

There were people who questioned whether there were more relevant issues to worry about than things Wayne said in 1971, and others who joked about whether Wayne would still be able to get work in Hollywood.

Glad to see John Wayne's offensive 1971 interview trending, but let's also take a moment to remember that King Henry VIII had two of his wives beheaded. Totally misogynistic. #CancelHenryVIII — Natalie Wynn 🦋 (@ContraPoints) February 19, 2019

Yet for others, Wayne’s legacy lives on. For some, his comments are disturbingly relevant to discussions still taking place in 2019.

Journalist and author Glenn Greenwald joined in the Twitter debate about the interview, which you can read in full here. In his 2008 book, “Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics,” Greenwald said the staunchly Republican actor has long served as a template for right-wing notions of “American courage and conservative manliness,” Publishers Weekly reported.

That’s largely because Wayne played World War II heroes and stalwart figures of the American West in many of the more than 200 Hollywood films he made from 1926 to 1977.

Greenwald, a co-founder of The Intercept, tweeted: “I devoted a book chapter to John Wayne, a conservative icon & one of the 20th Century’s most deceitful & pitiful men. A supporter of McCarthy, war cheerleader & moralizer who casually impugned patriotism & called people perverts while draft-dodging & having serial drunken affairs.”

As Greenwald suggested, Wayne’s biography shows that Wayne was anything but a real-life war hero. Other critics argued Tuesday, as they have for decades, that Wayne was no model of physical courage or moral rectitude.

Wayne’s record included three marriages and affairs, apparently doing all he could to avoid military service in World War II, leading efforts to help U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunt down Communists in Hollywood and holding views about race that many say were retrograde in 1971.

In the Playboy interview, Wayne, then in his 60s and fresh off his Oscar win for “True Grit,” discussed a range of topics, from working in Hollywood to race and sex. One of the more noteworthy quotes in the interview came up in a discussion about African-American political activist and academic Angela Davis.

“With a lot of blacks, there’s quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so,” Wayne said. “But we can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”

Later in the interview, Wayne also said he didn’t feel “guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago (black) people were slaves.” Wayne continued: “Now, I’m not condoning slavery. It’s just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can’t play football with the rest of us.”

‘I’m kind of stuck’: Class of 2020 struggling to find jobs amid coronavirus pandemic Wayne also decried “tokenism” in Hollywood. But he said he had been willing to give black actors opportunities in films he directed by hiring an actor to play “a black slave in ‘The Alamo’” and by having a “correct number of blacks in ‘The Green Berets.’”

Also in the interview, Wayne, whose Western films like “The Searchers” were accused of perpetuating stereotypes about Native Americans, accused Native Americans of “selfishly trying to keep (North America) to themselves.”

He also blasted Communists for teaching in American public schools and the depiction of gay sex in “Midnight Cowboy,” the 1970 best picture Oscar winner. Wayne used a homophobic slur to describe the characters played by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.

Matt Williams, a screenwriter who shared excerpts of the interview, wrote: “Jesus (expletive). John Wayne was a straight up piece of (expletive).”

Williams also pointed out that Wayne turned down a role in Mel Brooks’ Western spoof “Blazing Saddles” because the language was too “blue.”

Among those weighing in on Wayne’s interview were comedian Patton Oswalt, who addressed the actor’s quote that he gave African-American actors opportunities in his films.

“‘If it’s supposed to be a black character, naturally I use a black actor’ was as ‘woke’ as John Wayne got, I guess,” Oswalt tweeted.

Producer Joe Carnahan excoriated Wayne for being a war hawk, especially during the Vietnam War, even though he dodged service during World War II. Carnahan mentioned some of Wayne’s famous contemporaries who signed up to serve, including in combat units.

The Duke dodged service during WWII but was still a huge hawk. While Jimmy Stewart & Clark Gable were flying bombing runs over Berlin, Wayne was making fake war films. John Ford apparently tortured him on this point, repeatedly and ruthlessly.https://t.co/1vpf0udKa2 https://t.co/3Tau5h9Exy — Joe Carnahan (@carnojoe) February 18, 2019

Speaking of Wayne’s World War II record, Wayne started the war with a 3-A deferment from the draft for family dependency because he was the sole provider for a family of four, DenofGeek.com and film historian Karina Longworth explained in her “You Must Remember This” podcast. But those family deferments were later recalled. Wayne then qualified for a 2-A deferment because he was in Hollywood, engaged in making morale-building films that were believed to serve an important propaganda purpose, Longworth said.

There are conflicting accounts about whether Wayne made a serious attempt to join some branch of the military service. He appeared interested in a position in a unit of the Office of Strategic Services, where director John Ford was making documentary and reconnaissance films, according to Longworth. Ford had made Wayne a star by casting him in “Stagecoach” in 1939.

But it also appears that Wayne kept putting off joining the unit, saying he needed to finish up his next set of films, Longworth added. Ford continued to let Wayne know he was disappointed in his failure to serve, saying he was getting rich making movies while other men died, according to the PBS documentary American Masters.

Wayne’s reluctance to leave Hollywood may have been due a torrid love affair he was having with occasional co-star Marlene Dietrich, according to writer Marc Eliot in his book, “American Titan: Searching for John Wayne.” Longworth also said he may have worried how a long absence from Hollywood would affect his career.

In any case, Wayne’s lack of military service was back on people’s minds Tuesday, as were his “white supremacy,” slavery and tokenism comments. Wayne had some defenders on Twitter who said his views are not that shocking when seen in the context of 1971.

But others insisted that times haven’t changed as much as others think.

“Seeing John Wayne complain about seeing gay relationships in movies and accusing diverse roles of “tokenism” pretty much tells me (expletive) hasn’t changed one bit,” wrote one person. Another said:

But still others said it’s not useful to get worked up about Wayne’s comments when there are so many other “truly egregious” events to be concerned about:"

Jussie Smollett and/or his attorneys are prepared to sit down with police, and that decision staved off a grand jury at the 11th hour ... TMZ has learned.

Ola and Abel Osundairo were at a Chicago courthouse Tuesday, ready to testify before the grand jury ... according to sources connected to the case, however, that was nixed at the last minute. We're told they got a call that Jussie's legal team -- and possibly Jussie himself -- had agreed to talk to police.

End result ... the grand jury was postponed. We're told the meeting between cops and Jussie's team has not happened yet. We're also told the grand jury will not convene Wednesday morning.

As for the ongoing investigation into the ""attack"" ... we're told law enforcement believes it happened when it did, January 29, specifically because Jussie knew the Osundairo brothers were leaving for Nigeria the next day. Our sources say that trip was pre-planned, and not connected to the alleged attack.

Also, we're told the FBI met with the brothers Tuesday to talk about the hate mail that was sent to Jussie at Fox Studios in Chicago. The feds are checking to see if the postal stamp on the letter matches stamps police seized at the brothers' home in Chicago.

We're told the FBI is also looking into the ripped out magazine pages found in their home ... to see if there's any match to the cut-out letters used in the racist and homophobic letter.

Our sources say the brothers told police they had nothing to do with the letter, and only saw it in a photo on Jussie's phone."

EST:

According to Chicago Police who spoke with CBS Chicago, Empire actor Jussie Smollett is now considered a suspect for filing a false police report in an alleged attack that occurred on January 29.

Smollett faces a Class 4 felony charge which could amount to one to three years in jail if he is found guilty. On Wednesday CBS Chicago obtained surveillance video of the two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were previously arrested in connection with the incident, as they purchased “countless supplies,” items police believe were used in the attack. The outlet reports the purchases were made the day before the attack took place.

Detectives on the case are currently preparing evidence to present to a grand jury.

The brothers were later released by police after they were arrested and questioned, but gave information to the police which turned the investigation into a different direction, claiming Smollett gave them a cash payment to stage his own attack. The Osundairo’s told officials Smollett paid them $3,500 to pour bleach on the actor and tie a rope around his neck while they yelled racist and homophobic slurs. Through his attorneys, Smollett has denied any involvement or wrong doing.

Social media and the traditional news media have been split over Smollett’s innocence, with many arguing over Smollet’s initial report, while others say the police department has operated negligently with numerous leaks and unconfirmed information.

Media Sites Uncover More Details In Jussie Smollet’s Case, But What’s Their Motive?

New developments are unfurling in the midst of the Jussie Smollett case where the Empire actor alleges he was the victim of a racist and homophobic crime on January 29.

According to CNN, authorities discovered Smollet, 36, used a fake name when he was arrested during a 2007 DUI. The outlet confirmed the report with a spokesperson of the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.

Smollett was pulled over and gave officer’s the name “Jake,” which also happens to be the same name as one of his siblings, Variety reports. He pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor violations including providing false information to law enforcement, driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver license. Smollett was sentenced to two years probation and paid an undisclosed fine, according to the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.

For the last three weeks accusations and allegations have continued to mount surrounding Smollett’s case. Over the weekend, the story took a turn after Chicago police officials reported that two men who were initially identified as persons of interest, claim they received a cash payment from the actor to stage his attack. Smollett has since denied having a hand in his attack and also took the media to task over the continuous coverage that points him as a manipulative mastermind.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a Saturday statement.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

As many have pointed out the uncovering of more information in regards to what happened during the night of the alleged attack point to questions of race, access, and homophobia. The Chicago Police Department has a tainted history in regards to investigations regarding Black lives, from the killing of Black revolutionary Fred Hampton to the recent investigation of the state-sanctioned death of Laquan McDonald.

Smollet’s case shows that journalists and media voices have a due diligence to report the facts, but the facts of this case seem to be filtered through a lens of police leak after leak."

An attack that looks staged. A hate letter that may have been self-written. Scenes now cut from Empire. New investigations from the Chicago Police and FBI. Has Jussie Smollett now lost it all?

Update, Th. Feb 21st, 6:15 am PT: Jussie Smollett has now been arrested by Chicago Police. “Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives,” a Police spokesperson relayed.

Things don’t look well for once-respected actor Jussie Smollett.

After a multi-week investigation, Chicago Police are now naming Empire actor Jussie Smollett as a suspect in a criminal investigation. Initially, Smollett was being treated as a victim of a hate crime, though it now appears that he orchestrated the attack and fabricated a police report.

“Jussie Smollett is now officially classified as a suspect in a criminal investigation by Chicago Police for filing a false police report (Class 4 felony),” spokesman Anthony Guglielmi just posted on Twitter.

“Detectives are currently presenting evidence before a Cook County Grand Jury.”

On the morning of January 29th, Smollett claimed that he was brutally attacked in Chicago. The openly-gay actor said two individuals had approached him. They screamed ‘MAGA’ while attacking Smollett and allegedly pouring bleach on him.

The attack, presumably a premeditated hate crime, went even further. One individual tied a rope around Smollett’s neck, fashioning it as a noose. The other walked away, shouting, “This is MAGA country!”, a reference to President Donald Trump’s famous slogan. Smollett had previously received a threatening hate letter on January 22nd, seven days before the attack.

Police found the actor forty minutes later with the noose loosened, but still hanging around his neck.

Yet, examining the details, Smollett’s story has quickly fallen apart.

Now, Chicago Police are investigating Smollett for creating a hate crime hoax.

If guilty, Smollett could face Class 4 Felony charges and three years of prison time.

On top of that, the FBI has opened an investigation into the actor’s possible fabrication of the threatening letter. If the various stories are proven to be false, a disgraced career and jail time could result.

Initially, Chicago Police couldn’t find any suspects nor any leads. Nearly a dozen investigators were combing through footage from more than 20 cameras in the area, with nothing substantive emerging.

Then, a pair of brothers from Nigeria – close associates of Smollett – were detained and questioned. Based on information leaking from that questioning, it appears that the brothers staged the attack with Smollett’s guidance and payments.

To make matters worse, Smollett and his manager – allegedly talking on the phone at the time of the attack – have remained uncooperative. Both offered heavily-redacted phone records to authorities. Chicago Police complained the evidence was too scant to assist the investigation.

According to sources, one of the brothers purchased the rope from a nearby hardware store using Smollett’s money. He then fashioned it into a noose. Chicago Police confirmed that the purchase was made at the nearby hardware store.

Both brothers have reportedly worked on the set of Empire, and seem highly unlikely to spearhead a racially-charged attack in the name of ‘MAGA’.

Confirming a ‘shift’ had occurred as a result of the brothers’ information, a spokesperson for the Chicago police stated,

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

The FBI, with the help of the US Postal Service, has opened a serious investigation into the letter.

Federal authorities now believe Smollett may have written the letter and sent it to himself. The letter was sent to Chicago Cinespace Studios, where Empire is filmed. The envelope, which had ‘MAGA’ scribbled across it in bold, red letters, contained white powder.

Authorities later discovered the powder was merely aspirin. The letter remains in the FBI Crime Lab for analysis.

The two brothers – Ola and Abel Osundairo – reportedly stated that Smollett was furious that the letter didn’t garner enough attention.

Investigators now believe the actor may have paid the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack. Smollett’s lawyers, denying the attack was a “hoax,” stated,

“Anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Yet, the lawyer confirmed Smollett has “no plans” to meet with Chicago police for further questioning, seemingly underscoring his guilt.

In addition, details on Smollett’s previous legal issues have emerged.

The L.A. City Attorney’s office confirmed the actor was previously convicted and handed two years of probation. In 2007, he had pleaded no contest to driving under the influence, driving without a license, and providing false information to law enforcement officials.

As a result of the likely hoax, Empire has reportedly edited Smollet’s scenes for episodes that have wrapped up production.

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon on the popular industry-inspired series.

Smollett had nine scenes this season along with a “big musical number.” Fox has reportedly now cut five of these scenes along with the musical number, according to the Wrap. Four other scenes “have been rewritten to focus more on an ensemble” than on Smollett.

Writers have reportedly made “multiple revisions” to the second-to-last episode’s script in the last 24 hours.

Updated: Feb. 20th, 2:30 pm PT: Fox now says they aren’t editing out Smollett scenes, despite the issues surrounding the actor.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment stated on Wednesday.

Sulzberger on Wednesday unleashed a blistering response to President Donald Trump’s declaration that his newspaper is the “enemy of the people.”

Hours after the president accused the Times of fabricating its reporting and not bothering to reach out to the White House for comment — a claim that Times report Maggie Haberman shot down as “a lie” — Sulzberger compared the president to foreign tyrants who don’t just complain about negative coverage, but try to portray the role of the free press as illegitimate.

“But in demonizing the free press as the enemy, simply for performing its role of asking difficult questions and bringing uncomfortable information to light, President Trump is retreating from a distinctly American principle,” he said. “It’s a principle that previous occupants of the Oval Office fiercely defended regardless of their politics, party affiliation, or complaints about how they were covered.”

Sulzberger then went on to discuss the historical implications of calling journalists “enemies of the people,” which Trump has continued to say even after some of his supporters have physically attacked journalists.

“The phrase ‘enemy of the people’ is not just false, it’s dangerous,” he said. “It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information. And it is particularly reckless coming from someone whose office gives him broad powers to fight or imprison the nation’s enemies.”

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated,” the statement said. “He is not being written out of the show.”

When asked on Tuesday about reports saying Smollett’s role had been reduced in the wake of an ongoing investigation by the Chicago Police Department, Fox had previously declined to comment, fueling speculation that the network was preparing to cut ties with him.

Empire is currently filming its fifth season in Chicago and, according to TMZ, Smollett is appearing in only four of the nine scenes he was originally supposed to act in. One of the five scenes that were cut reportedly included “a big musical number” in an upcoming episode.

Chicago police are continuing to investigate what Smollett has said was a homophobic and racist attack on him in the city last month. He denies the incident was a hoax that he orchestrated.

Fox has stood by Smollett since he first reported being attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, the studio released a statement responding to speculation that the actor’s role on Empire was being slashed.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” the statement said. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

A source close to Fox also told BuzzFeed News last week that the network still considers Smollett a “key player” on the show and that they believe the attack “really happened.”"

At no time since the Civil War or the anti-establishment counter-cultural movement that began a century later — both of which were brought about by Democrats and their Left-wing descendants — have Americans been so divided and so full of irreconcilable hate.

From the deplatforming of conservatives and supporters of POTUS Donald Trump by the social media giants to the endless production of fake news and the perpetuation of hoaxes meant to inflame political passions by the MSM, America is on the precipice of open hostilities by rival factions.

The most recent incident involves the likely hate crime hoax by Jussie Smollett, a second-tier black homosexual actor who has selfishly weaponized his skin color and sexuality in an attempt to perpetuate the dangerous lie that our president is a racist, bigoted homophobe.

As new details roll out by the day indicating that police now believe Smollett staged a ‘racial’ attack to perpetuate a false stereotype of the president’s supporters, his disgusting lie is being perpetuated by a dishonest Left-wing media hell-bent on destroying their own country, which they’ve been brainwashed into believing is imperialistic and illegitimate.

As Leftist propaganda factories like CNN gaslight the country regarding Smollett’s hate crime, one legitimate journalist, Andy Ngo, is pushing back. In a tweet storm earlier this week, he ticked off one fake race crime hoax after another that the MSM was quick to report, sans evidence, or ignored once the hoaxes were discovered. (Related: It’s time for a NATIONAL EMERGENCY conversation about fake news media constantly spreading “hate crime” hoaxes like the phony Jussie Smollett “lynching.”)

The hoaxes will lead to violence and death

Here’s a short list:

— Shortly after the 2016 election, the far-Left hate mongers at Southern Poverty Law Center stoked fear and loathing after a pro-homosexual Episcopal Church was allegedly vandalized with a painted message, “Heil Trump.” It was a hoax; the church’s gay organ player did it and he was only charged with a misdemeanor.

Right after Donald Trump’s election, the SPLC really stoked panic. A pro-gay Episcopal church in Indiana was vandalized w/“Heil Trump,” a swastika, & an anti-gay slur. Turns out it was the gay organ player who did it. He was only charged w/a misdemeanor. https://t.co/QxeOoBHohC — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 17, 2019

— A few days after a mass shooting in Pittsburgh, supporters of the president were accused of Nazi vandalism at a Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn as well as starting fires in a Jewish community.

Ngo listed scores of other examples (begin his tweet series by clicking here). But in every case, like with the Smollett hoax, the MSM, Democrats, and the Hollywood Left piled on the story, casting aspersions (and threats) against Trump supporters and conservatives in general, only to be proven wrong, and refusing to acknowledge it.

Here’s the thing: One day, and soon, one of these hoaxes will spark a clash — perhaps even a race war — that won’t end until hundreds or even thousands of Americans have died and entire portions of several cities have been destroyed.

And what’s more, the disgustingly dishonest media will be largely responsible for perpetuating the lies that will lead to the clashes, the death, and the destruction.

POTUS Trump calls the MSM “enemies of the people” for a reason. It’s because they are.

Empire type TV Show network Fox

Fox is continuing to stand by Jussie Smollett amid the continuing investigation into the attack on the Empire star.

On Tuesday, EW confirmed that upcoming scenes featuring the actor, who has been the breakout music star from the hit series, have been both reduced and rewritten. And after previously shooting down reports that Smollett’s motivation for possibly faking this incident was that he was being killed of Empire, Fox is once again denying that he’s on his way out.

In a new statement Wednesday, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

While Smollett had initially been viewed as the victim of an apparent racial and homophobic attack, over the weekend, Chicago PD confirmed to EW that new evidence has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” New reports say that the two original suspects, who have ties to Smollett through Empire, were prepared to testify Tuesday in front of a grand jury that they were hired by the actor to stage the attack, before a call from Smollett’s lawyers postponed the proceedings.

Throughout the wild last few weeks of twists and turns in the story, Smollett has had the backing of Fox and the Empire creative team, including co-creator Danny Strong and showrunner Brett Mahoney, who on Saturday tweeted, “I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett. Keep your head up.” And the insistence that Smollett’s Jamal Lyon won’t be killed off of the series comes as the major story line of season 5 has been centered on a mysterious death, with the victim’s identity yet to be revealed.

Empire returns March 13.

Smollett reported that on Jan. 29 he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. He claimed that the men shouted racist and anti-gay slurs at him, poured a chemical substance on him, threw a rope around his neck and shouted, ""This is MAGA country!""

Two brothers -- Ola and Abel Osundairo -- were arrested and released without charges in relation to the incident and were set to have their testimony “locked in” before a grand jury, meaning it would be officially documented. But Smollett’s legal team presented information to prosecutors that delayed the brothers' testimony, the sources say.

""The two brothers involved in this incident were at a Chicago courthouse meeting with detectives and prosecutors. They did not get seated before a grand jury,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement Tuesday.

Police released the two brothers who were held for questioning about the reported attack. They were released late Friday without charges.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” the brothers later said in a statement to CBS News.

Richard Shotwell/Invision / AP

CHICAGO — Chicago's top prosecutor recused herself from the investigation into the attack reported by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett shortly after police requested another interview with the actor.

The office of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had ""shifted"" after detectives released two brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn't specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police said the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo. The men were released from custody without charges and police later requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" She didn't respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows that he pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence. Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court, records show. He later was charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked in downtown Chicago while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. He said in addition to the bigoted slurs, his attackers also shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" He also said they poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

Related: Empire: Jussie Smollett's Role Reduced

This is the second time in a few days that Fox has weighed in on the events playing out, and on both of occasions, the studio has supported the actor.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the studio previously said.

""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

While Jussie sought medical assistance at the end of January and filed a police report alleging that he was attacked, the story has developed a lot in the last few days.

Multiple outlets are reporting that Chicago PD is entertaining the possibility that Smollett was an active participant in the attack, and TMZ is reporting that the case could go to the grand jury in the coming days.

Smollett's lawyers were quick to refute claims that the actor and singer faked his attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement released on Saturday reads.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

There are even reports that Smollett knew the two brothers that were hauled in for questioning about the attack.

The statement from Fox comes amid claims that Smollett's screentime for the final two episodes of Empire Season 5 is being drastically reduced.

Given that the big mystery of Empire Season 5 involves a beloved character being killed off, many thought this could be the way Smollett could be potentially written out.

However, given that Fox is vehemently denying the reports, it sounds like Smollett's job is safe ... for now.

Smollett was originally charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct related to allegedly filing a false police report over his claims.

He said in late January that two men assaulted him and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

But scepticism eventually grew over his story, and investigators quickly concluded that Smollett staged the attack. Smollett has denied he staged the attack, and pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Visit INSIDER’s homepage for more stories.

Chicago authorities released hundreds of pages of documents on Thursday related to the arrest and investigation into Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” actor whom police accused of staging an elaborate attack on himself and passing it off as a hate crime.

Smollett, 36, was arrested in February and charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to police about the attack. On March 26, prosecutors announced they would drop the charges against him, though they still believed Smollett was guilty.

Smollett alleged that two men assaulted him in late January, shouting racist and homophobic slurs and tying a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay, and he plays an LGBT character on the Fox series.

But cracks in his story quickly emerged, and investigators began looking into whether Smollett paid off two men to assault him in an extravagant hoax. After the charges were dropped, Smollett continued to deny that he staged the attack.

Here’s how the rapidly moving case unfolded.

January 22: An anonymous letter reportedly arrives at the “Empire” set, addressed to Smollett and using letters clipped from magazines to spell out “You will die black f-g.” The letter lists “MAGA” as the return address.

THE LETTER: “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack” – CPD sources. Jussie Smollett received a hate letter Jan. 22.

January 29: Smollett’s manager calls the Chicago police at 2:42 a.m. to report an attack on Smollett that they say occurred roughly 40 minutes earlier.

When officers arrived at Smollett’s apartment, they found him with a “thin, light rope” still around his neck. Smollett told the officers the men attacked him as he was walking back to an apartment from a Subway restaurant.

He said they yelled racist slurs, hit him in the face, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and tied the rope around his neck.

January 29: Later that morning in a follow-up interview, Smollett tells officers the men also yelled “This is MAGA country” after the attack. The Chicago police say that they are investigating the attack as a hate crime and that Smollett is “fully cooperating.”

“The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m OK,” he said. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be and I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett also addressed the scepticism that had already begun to take hold on social media and said he wanted to clarify some of the misconceptions.

“I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked – they were not broken,” he said. “I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalized. Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform but said to take care, obviously. And above all: I fought the f— back.”

February 11: After investigators request Smollett’s phone records, Smollett turns in “limited and heavily redacted” records that “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation,” Chicago’s police department said.

February 12: The Chicago police tell INSIDER they’re not considering charging Smollett with making a false report.

“Why would we charge a victim of a crime with a crime? That makes no sense,” Michael Carroll, an officer working in the Chicago Police Department communications office, told the INSIDER reporter Jacob Shamsian. “He is a victim of a crime that doesn’t belong in our city.”

He added: “False report charges, huh? We said multiple times, he is still considered a victim.”

Carroll said Smollett gave them his phone records in a PDF with redactions, which don’t meet the standards of evidence the police department requires. He said the department was seeking the phone records in the original format.

“It’s not that we’re saying he’s lying, or changed them,” Carroll said. “We need to be able to have our detective to go to a judge and say under oath they were verified.”

He added: “In the end, if we charge someone, they have to be found guilty without a reasonable doubt.”

February 13: The Chicago police say they arrested two men in connection with the attack. They are later identified though media reports as Ola and Abel Osundairo — two Americans with connections to Smollett and to “Empire.”

A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, also said one of the brothers appeared on “Empire.”

The men’s lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, said in a statement the men were “baffled” that the police linked them to the attack and said they’re not guilty.

“They send their best to Jussie,” she added.

The police denied media reports suggesting the attack was a hoax, painting the reports as inaccurate.

February 16: Local and national news outlets, citing anonymous sources, report that detectives are now investigating whether Smollett paid the two brothers to stage the attack.

Guglielmi, the Chicago police spokesman, told INSIDER “there are some new developments in the investigation and we are now interested in speaking to the ‘Empire’ cast member again.”

Smollett’s lawyers released a statement denying reports that he staged the attack and affirming that Smollett was the victim of a hate crime.

That same day, sources told CBS Chicago that the two brothers who were detained by the Chicago police were seen on surveillance video at the Crafty Beaver hardware store on January 25, just days before Smollett said he was attacked.

The two men reportedly told investigators they bought some rope at the store at Smollett’s direction and they bought a red hat at the Uptown beauty supply store.

February 19: Reports reveal that the FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett participated in sending the threatening letter he received on January 22.

The two brothers told investigators that Smollett had sent the letter to himself and that they helped him stage the attack after he grew upset that news of the threatening letter didn’t get enough attention, ABC News and CBS News reported, citing federal officials and other sources.

The police also shot down a tip that a witness spotted Smollett in an elevator with the two brothers, saying there was no video evidence to support that accusation.

February 19: Media outlets unearth 2007 court records showing that Smollett previously pleaded no contest to giving false information to police officers.

According to a misdemeanour complaint filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by the Associated Press, Smollett identified himself as his young brother, Jake Smollett, when a police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence in 2007.

Smollett pleaded no contest to giving false information, driving under the influence, and driving without a valid licence. He also completed an alcohol education and treatment program, the records show.

February 20: In a statement, Fox denies reports that Smollett is being written out of “Empire.”

Earlier in the day, detectives and the Osundairo brothers testified before a grand jury, according to the Associated Press.

Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement they’re preparing to conduct a “thorough investigation” and “mount an aggressive defence.”

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” the lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in the statement.

February 21: Chicago police announce they have arrested Smollett, rebuking him in a stinging press conference for staging a “publicity stunt.”

Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson laced into Smollett for exploiting the country’s sensitivity to racism and hate crimes in order to further his career, and said Smollett should apologise to the city.

“Why would anyone – especially an African-American man – use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson told reporters. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Johnson said Smollett staged the “publicity stunt” because he was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire.” Johnson said Smollett paid the two brothers with a $US3,500 check.

Detective Commander Edward Wodnicki said at the press conference that a team of investigators had traced the two brothers through a variety of public and private surveillance cameras, tracking their movements as they fled the scene of the alleged attack, took a taxi to Chicago’s O’Hare airport, and immediately boarded a flight to Nigeria.

Working alongside federal investigators and the US Customs and Border Protection agency, Chicago detectives then determined the brothers had purchased roundtrip tickets. The investigators caught up with them when they returned to the city on February 13, Wodnicki said.

Chicago police detained the men for 48 hours – the maximum amount of time police can detain people without filing charges – and Johnson said it wasn’t until the 47th hour of the men’s detention that detectives truly started to doubt Smollett’s story.

“Quite rankly, it pissed everybody off,” Johnson said. “Those are resources and time spent that we can never get back, that we could have used for another investigation.”

February 21: The president weighs in on the arrest in a tweet, accusing him of insulting Trump supporters across the country by accusing his alleged attackers of yelling Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

February 21: Smollett is released on bond, and prosecutors reveal new details of the alleged hoax.

Smollett’s bond was set at $US100,000 and he had to surrender his passport.

According to court documents prosecutors released, Smollett had been upset with the lacklustre reaction from Empire Studios to the racist letter he had received. So three days later, according to the documents, Smollett reached out to the brothers, texting Abel, “Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?”

Smollett then told Abel he wanted to stage an attack, and that Abel’s brother Ola should help.

He then detailed his plans to the brothers, saying they should attack him near his apartment building and yell out “Empire F– Empire N—,” and give him a chance to “appear to fight back,” the documents said. Smollett also allegedly instructed the brothers to put a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him, and yell, “This is MAGA country.”

February 22: “Empire” producers announce Smollett will be taken out of the last two episodes of the season.

Fox

Smollett’s character Jamal will not appear in the final two episodes of this season of “Empire,” the series executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer said in a statement.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the statement said. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Chicago Tribune/E. Jason Wambsgans via Associated Press Actor Jussie Smollet appears with his attorney Tina Glandian, left, at a hearing for a judge assignment at Leighton Criminal Court in Chicago, Thursday, March 14, 2019.

Smollett could have faced up to three years in prison had he been convicted.

March 26: Prosecutors make a surprise announcement that they are dropping all charges against Smollett and the records from his case will be sealed.

""Do you believe that he is innocent?"" CBS reporter @adrianasdiaz asks First Assistant Cook County State's Attorney Joseph Magats about dropping charges against Jussie Smollett. ""I do not believe he is innocent,"" Magats responds. pic.twitter.com/NEWZuD2aBe — CBS Chicago (@cbschicago) March 26, 2019

Joe Magats, Cook County’s first assistant state’s attorney, told media that the dropped charges don’t mean Smollett is innocent, and that their decision not to prosecute does not “exonerate” him.

But Smollett completed 16 hours of community service in recent days and agreed to forfeit the $US10,000 bail he had paid after his arrest. Magats told CBS Chicago that his decision was largely based on his office’s resources and its priority to prosecute violent cases.

“Based on all facts and circumstances of the case, and also keeping in mind resources and keeping in mind that the office’s number one priority is to combat violent crime and the drivers of violence, I decided to offer this disposition in the case,” Magats said.

The news triggered outrage came as a shock not only to the public, but to Chicago police and the mayor, who said they found out about the dropped charges at the same time everyone else did.

Johnson said at a press conference he was disappointed in the prosecutors’ decision and accused Smollett and his attorneys of crafting a deal with prosecutors to “circumvent” the criminal-justice system.

“Do I think justice was served? No,” he said. “What do I think justice is? I think this city is still owed an apology.”

Mayor Rahm Emanuel was enraged, calling the decision a “whitewash of justice” and said Smollett needed to be held accountable for his alleged crimes.

“This is a person who has been let off scot-free with no sense of the accountability of the moral and ethical wrong of his actions,” Emanuel said.

March 26: Smollett spoke to media shortly after the announcement, reiterating his denial that he had staged the attack.

He told reporters he wanted to “get back to work” and move on with his life – but added that he was innocent of all the charges.

“I want you to know that not for a moment was it in vain. I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,” he said. “I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I was accused of.”

Smollett’s attorneys also said in a statement that Smollett is a “victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgment.”

March 26: Some of Smollett’s “Empire” colleagues appeared to gloat at the news, tweeting a picture of a CNN newscast announcing the dropped charges, and retweeting statements from Smollett and his family.

March 27: Speculation quickly turned to whether Smollett could face federal charges.

The FBI is still investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending the threatening letter he received January 22, leading news outlets to speculate over whether Smollett could face mail fraud charges.

May 23: A Chicago judge ordered that Smollett’s court records be unsealed, after media organisations argued in court that Smollett’s case was a national news story and there was massive public interest in the records.

In Illinois, records are immediately sealed in cases where charges are dismissed, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.

Smollett’s lawyers had argued that he was entitled to the same privacy as other defendants, but the judge ruled that Smollett had contradicted that by making media appearances both before he was charged and after the charges were dropped.

May 30: Chicago police released hundreds of pages of documents related to their investigation, raising further speculation on exactly when and why prosecutors changed their mind about charging Smollett.

Getty Images/Nuccio DiNuzzo Cook County State’s attorney Kim Foxx arrives to speak with reporters and details the charges against R. Kelly’s first court appearance at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse on February 23, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

The documents did not offer insight into prosecutors’ decisions, as they came from the police department rather than the prosecutors’ office. But they did reveal that prosecutors decided within two weeks of Smollett’s February 28 indictment that they intended to drop the charges.

“[State’s Attorney Kim Foxx] felt the case would be settled with Smollett paying the city of Chicago $US10,000 in restitution and doing community service,” one detective wrote in an email,according to The New York Times.

Chicago’s police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, had previously said he didn’t know the charges would be dropped until the day they were announced.

CHICAGO — Chicago police say “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report when he reported that he was attacked by two masked men.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office approved the felony charge on Wednesday afternoon. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

Smollett reported to police that on Jan. 29 two masked men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, threw a chemical substance at him and looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck.

The charges against Smollett were filed after two men who allegedly took part in the scheme testified before a grand jury."

The actor has reportedly fired his attorney and hired Michael Cohen’s defense lawyer, Michael Monico, as his new legal representation.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the Fox show Empire, was attacked in an alleged hate crime on January 29 by two men who he said used anti-gay and racist epithets.

The show is reportedly doing “serious rewrites” to cut back on Smollett’s scenes from episodes filming this week.

On January 22, the Fox studio in Chicago where Empire is recorded received a letter threatening Smollett. The letter called him a “black fag” and included a drawing of a person being hanged and shot.

The envelope also contained a white powder that was later determined to be crushed aspirin.

That letter brought the FBI into what would have otherwise been a local police investigation, since the letter was sent by the U.S. Postal Service.

Two unnamed federal officials told ABC News that the FBI and USPIS are investigating whether Smollett had a role in sending that letter.

The letter is currently being examined by an FBI crime lab.

The news comes after Chicago police talked with two persons of interest, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, brothers who had both worked with Smollett in the past, and released them this past Friday.

Police have not been able to verify their accusations.

The brothers said that Smollett paid them to stage the January 29 attack because the letter did not get enough attention, an accusation that Smollett has denied through his lawyers.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the lawyers said in a statement over the weekend.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Yesterday, TMZ reported that Smollett’s role on Empire is being reduced, according to an unnamed production source.

The source said that the role reduction is a result of growing public sentiment that he staged the attack.

Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a musical number in the second to last episode of the season, but that has been reduced to four scenes and the musical number was cut, according to TMZ‘s source. He has a reduced role in the four remaining scenes.

TMZ had previously reported that Smollett was worried his character was going to be cut from the show before the attack, something that Twentieth Century Fox Television denied."

CCTV taken in the early hours of January 29 showed the two people of interest that were interviewed by police and later released. Credit:Chicago Police Department The police announcement came after a flurry of activity in recent days that included lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them. Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account - something police signalled on Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Loading Smollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" - before fleeing. Earlier on Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show, which follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. The statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack. Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment. Cook County State's attorney Kim Foxx, pictured during an unrelated court case, has recused herself. Credit:AP The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett before being released. The next day, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"" and detectives had requested another interview with Smollett.

Loading The Osundairos' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, has not responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press. Smollett's lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, have said the actor was angered and ""victimised"" by reports suggesting that he may have played a role in staging the attack. ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" Pugh and Henderson said Saturday in a statement. If Smollett's account is determined to be a fabrication, legal experts say he could be charged with any number of felonies. The most obvious charge is felony disorderly conduct, which is legalese for filing a false police report.

Such a charge is fairly common. In Boone County, Illinois, for example, a woman is awaiting trial on allegations that she called in a false threat of a gunman in September. The call prompted a police search for a suspect and put several area schools on lockdown. Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with the same crime when her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport came apart. Police found surveillance video that showed the woman and an accomplice walking through the airport without the items they claimed were stolen. Another possibility is an obstruction-of-justice charge. Both crimes are Class 4 felonies, which in addition to prison time carry the possibility of a fine of $US25,000.

Loading Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record. Smollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program. Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a massive investigation that lasted nearly a month and included the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge. For an investigation that took only a single day, Weisberg's client had to split restitution of $US8400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars."" Also Wednesday, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation. Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor. AP"

How should the media report hate crimes and alleged hate crimes? How should media report alleged hate crimes that are now suspected hoaxes? And lastly, most dizzyingly, how should media report alleged hate crimes that are now suspected hoaxes when the hoax may, itself, be a hoax?

In late January, “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who is black and gay, with Jewish heritage, was hospitalized after being attacked by two men who first shouted racial slurs, then beat him physically, poured a chemical substance on his face, and placed a noose around his neck, Chicago Police reported.

Chicago Police Department just sent out this statement re:

Jussie Smollett pic.twitter.com/DxQswZn8xd— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) January 29, 2019

Smollett told police that his attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country,” in reference to the President’s slogan.

The attack, the police wrote, was to be treated as “a possible hate crime.”

Now some sources have claimed that the attack was a hoax orchestrated by Smollett himself. On February 13, Vox reports, police arrested two brothers, who were being treated as “persons of interest.” It became clear that the two brothers knew Smollett professionally, and both were released, with the Chicago Police Department saying that new findings had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Multiple publications quoted unnamed sources who said that Smollett staged the attack, though on February 14 Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the hoax reports are “unconfirmed.” He added that reporting by ABC7Chicago, which claimed to use Chicago police as sources, was “uninformed and inaccurate.”

On the 17th, Guglielmi tweeted that detectives for the Chicago PD will interview Smollett again, writing, “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

The alleged attack has triggered an avalanche of responses as details have been released. One consistent factor has been pushback on social media against the reporting of the story.

Though responses to coverage have been consistently critical, the criticism itself has shifted on its axis. Initially, critics expressed disgust over reporting of an “alleged” attack and a “possible” hate crime. Later, critics berated media for reporting the alleged attack at all.

The criticism, which comes primarily from the left, that journalists and media groups should not hesitate to label clearly racist events, for example, as “racist” instead of “racially charged,” has become common. Criticism primarily from the right, that media is fixated on victims and addicted to stories about identity politics, is also nothing new.

But there’s no winning in the Smollett case anyway. It ends either with the vindication of a man who was brutally attacked and belittled, or the revelation that he lied will cast suspicion on anyone who comes forward as a victim of a hate crime.

Smollett is at the center of a Chicago Police Department investigation over an alleged attack he said occurred on January 29, which has drawn increasing skepticism in recent weeks.

Police are now reportedly investigating whether Smollett paid off two brothers to stage the attack.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court.

Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence, and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News, which also reported that Smollett was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail.

News of the 2007 case comes amid growing skepticism over an attack that Smollett alleges occurred on January 29, 2019. The incident initially sparked widespread outrage on behalf of Smollett, who is black and gay, and prompted the Chicago Police Department to investigate the incident as a hate crime.

Smollett said two men assaulted him, tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical on him, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

But after interviewing two brothers who were seen on surveillance cameras leaving the scene of the alleged attack, Chicago police have apparently pivoted their investigation into whether Smollett paid the two men to stage the assault, multiple media outlets reported, citing federal officials and other sources.

Smollett has maintained that he is telling the truth about the assault, and his attorneys last Saturday released a statement saying Smollett was ""further victimized"" by the accusations that he staged the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" they said."

Smollett was originally charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct related to allegedly filing a false police report over his claims.

He said in late January that two men assaulted him and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

But skepticism eventually grew over his story, and investigators quickly concluded that Smollett staged the attack. Smollett has denied he staged the attack, and pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Chicago authorities released hundreds of pages of documents on Thursday related to the arrest and investigation into Jussie Smollett, the ""Empire"" actor whom police accused of staging an elaborate attack on himself and passing it off as a hate crime.

Smollett, 36, was arrested in February and charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to police about the attack. On March 26, prosecutors announced they would drop the charges against him, though they still believed Smollett was guilty.

Smollett alleged that two men assaulted him in late January, shouting racist and homophobic slurs and tying a rope around his neck. Smollett is black and gay, and he plays an LGBT character on the Fox series.

But cracks in his story quickly emerged, and investigators began looking into whether Smollett paid off two men to assault him in an extravagant hoax. After the charges were dropped, Smollett continued to deny that he staged the attack.

Here's how the rapidly moving case unfolded."

Police found surveillance video that showed the woman and an accomplice walking through the airport without the items they claimed were stolen.

Chicago — Chicago's top prosecutor recused herself from the investigation into the attack reported by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett shortly after police requested another interview with the actor. The office of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn't specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo. The men were released from custody without charges, and police later requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos' attorney has not responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said.

The new statement comes after reports surfaced Tuesday that Smollet had his role cut back in the episode of the Fox series that is currently being filmed.

Smollet faces claims that he staged an assault on himself in Chicago late last month in what was described as a suspected hate crime. The actor and musician stated that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him, and put a rope around his neck. It was also reported the two men used the phrase “MAGA country” during the attack, a reference to President Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Since then, the Chicago police have begun investigating whether or not Smollett paid brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to stage the attack. Police previously arrested the brothers but they were later released without being charged.

Smollett and his representatives have repeatedly denied that he staged the attack.

As Variety reported on Tuesday, Smollett would face charges of falsifying a police report, a Class 4 felony in Illinois, should his story prove to be false."

Despite his claims that he was beaten up in a racist and homophobic attack, police reportedly believe that he paid his perpetrators.

According to American rapper Cardi B, news that actor Jussie Smollett could have orchestrated the racially charged attack on him has taken its toll on Black History Month.

""I'm really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*ck his name is,"" the 26-year-old hip-hop sensation said during a livestream.

""I feel like he f***ed up Black History Month, bro,"" added the performer, who was born Belcalis Almánzar.

""I'm not gonna say yet, until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this sh*t was staged,"" she added, suggesting that Smollett could have been ""framed"" to make it ""look like he's a liar"".

""But if he's not [been framed], then, bro, he f***ed up for real,"" she continued, saying that if it were the case, it would give Donald Trump ""immunity to laugh at n****s and sh*t, to make motherf***ers look bad"".

While some fans praised Cardi for her comments, a host of critics pointed out that her opinion on the matter was somewhat irrelevant, given her contribution to the culture.

And after all the hard work she’s done to uplift American culture…. — Kevin Durant? (@markand4503) 19 февраля 2019 г.

What do we keep giving her a platform? I think I feel dumber every time I see an opinion of hers. — Schnickels (@Schnickels1) 19 февраля 2019 г.

Why does Cardi B continue to speak on issues she knows nothing about?



Stick to twerking, Cardi. — CJ Pearson (@thecjpearson) 19 февраля 2019 г.

​Some people, on the other hand, felt like Smollett didn't ruin Black History Month.

No he didn’t, his actions don’t reflect all black people just as the action of a white person don’t reflect all whites. Some people are just jerks. — Palermo calcio (@Isoloto) 20 февраля 2019 г.

I don't know if he ruined it, but he definitely became part of it. — Kevin Alexander (@KalMan42) 20 февраля 2019 г.

Jussie Smollett, an openly gay black actor best known for his role in Fox series Empire, said he was attacked in Chicago in January by two people, who allegedly beat him, poured a chemical substance on him, and yelled racist and homophobic slurs.

His case took a twist over the weekend after reports surfaced that Chicago Police arrested, interviewed and released the two suspects — and now believe that Smollett staged the attack — something that his attorneys deny."

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted” after detectives released two brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. The men were released from custody without charges and police later requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” She didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows that he pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence. Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court, records show. He later was charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked in downtown Chicago while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. He said in addition to the bigoted slurs, his attackers also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” He also said they poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

The L.A. City’s Attorney’s office confirmed this.

An L.A City Attorney’s Spokesperson said Smollett was sentenced at the time to two years probation and had a choice of jail or a fine.

Chicago police found out about this case while investigating if Smollett falsified about being a victim of a hate crime. Chicago law enforcement has requested LAPD to provide any information they have about the 2007 arrest.

Police sources told NBC News that the LAPD initially arrested Smollett. The case was sent to the LA City’s Attorney’s office in the Van Nuys area and was handled by their prosecutors.

Chicago police have shifted their focus of Smollett’s attack from being a hate crime to a case regarding filing a false report.

Law enforcement has not stated publically if Smollet is considered a suspect or victim. They want to speak with Smollett, who refuses.

On Feb. 19 Chicago law enforcement received a tip from an eyewitness. The source told them on the night he of the alleged hate crime attack, Smollett was seen in the elevator at his apartment building with the two brothers who were questioned for assaulting the actor. The brothers were eventually released without being charged.

Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago police spokesperson, said a person who was in the building at the time saw the three men together on the night Smollett was attacked. Guglielmi says the police have not verified the eyewitness’ account and planned on interviewing the person shortly.

Case in point: Democrats decry Trump’s use of the presidential power of the executive order (a power, it should be noted, that former President Barack Obama used 13 times) to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, which they hope to bottle up in court.

To Democrats, the well-being of Americans (who, it should also be noted, pay their exorbitant salaries) is second to the goal of destroying Trump. Democrats have tied his hands in Congress, and now are set to begin open-ended probes into everything from his taxes to his children. They don’t care about their actions’ impact on the United States.

But nowhere is the goal to rip down Trump at any cost more evident than the ongoing Jussie Smollett debacle. The TV star last month claimed he was the victim of a racist anti-gay attack — by two Trump supporters, of course — and Democrats, along with the lapdog media, ate it up with a spoon.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once and for all.”

She later deleted the tweet, but only after many questions emerged about Smollett’s account of the attack.

Responding to a report that said Smollett had suffered a “possible homophobic and racially charged attack,” Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: “There is no such thing as ‘racially charged.’ This attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugarcoat the rise of hate crimes.”

To Democrats, there was no point in waiting for the facts to come out (just as they refused to do in the Senate confirmation hearing for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh). The story fit their narrative, so they ran with it — damn the facts.

Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat running for president, took the opportunity to sow division: “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.” California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is also a 2020 Democratic hopeful, apparently got the same talking points: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the new Muslim congresswoman from Michigan, went further: “When one of the most famous black and gay men in America is not safe, the message is clearer than it has ever been. The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is killing & hurting our people,” she tweeted.

The limousine liberals got in on the act, too. Singer Katy Perry tweeted, “Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today… this is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country.”

The media got a thrill up its collective leg. “There are many indications of a hate crime here. They are looking for two suspects who were apparently wearing ‘Make America Great Again’ hats, though that has not yet been officially confirmed,” said MSNBC national correspondent Miguel Almaguer. Unconfirmed rumor? Good enough for MSNBC.

And it all came around, as it so often does, to blaming Trump. Washington Post writer Eugene Scott wrote: “To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a ‘great America’ does not appear to include them.”

Karen Attiah, a Washington Post editor, wrote: “Regarding the heinous attack on @JussieSmollett, yet another reminder that Trump’s ascendance and the resulting climate of hate has meant that lives have been increasingly at stake since 2015. Smollett could have been killed by those thugs screaming MAGA. Let that sink in.”

Amy Siskind, a Huffington Post contributor, tweeted: “Can we get anyone in the Trump orbit to condemn the 2 MAGA men who brutally attacked Jussie Smollett, a gay black man, and put his head in a noose while saying ‘This is MAGA country,’ so others don’t feel like your silence is legitimizing hate? How about you @realDonaldTrump?”

Said Liz Plank of Vox: “There is real evidence of people who have done these crimes, who cite that the President has inspired them.”

This is what Democrats do. They’re all about division — black and white, rich and poor, gay and straight. Division is the glue that holds the party together. Without that, they’d have nothing. And America be damned. Liberals couldn’t care less about unity and tolerance — despite their constant utterance of the words. What they want is power, and for the masses to be beholden to them.

And the last thing they want is for facts to mess up a good story. As Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel once said, “Never let a tragedy go to waste.”

Shapiro pointed out that the Smollett story fit a narrative that the media prefer, that America is racist, bigoted and homophobic, and that Trump supporters are awful people, while the attack on the Jewish man defied the media’s narrative because it wasn’t committed by white supremacists.

Perino began by referencing the difference in media attention between the vast coverage of the Jussie Smollett story and the absolute lack of coverage of the attack on a Jewish man in Brooklyn. She turned to Shapiro, saying, “We want to get your take on this, Ben, because you wrote about this yesterday, and it was pretty stark, when you look at the differences.”

Shapiro explained why the media gave blanket coverage to the Smollet story while ignoring the attack on the Jewish man:

Absolutely: one of these assaults was caught on tape; the other turns out to be a complete hoax. The amount of attention paid to the assault on the Jewish man in New York was nil; the media legitimately did not cover it. The amount of attention on Jussie Smollett, of course, was enormous, and that’s because there’s a narrative to be promoted. Jonathan Kay, part of The Washington Post, nearly admitted this on MSNBC; he essentially said that a lot of people bought into the Jussie Smollett narrative, which is that Trump supporters are stalking black people all around America to beat them, seeking to harass them, and this was a perfect story. Now, when a story is too perfect to be true, it usually is, and this is one of those cases. But the real question is why hate crimes in New York, which have been up dramatically this year, largely targeting Jews in New York City, have not been covered.

Perino commented: “We have some numbers, if I could just show; in New York, in 2018, you see steady attacks at 186 last year. And then, that’s not just New York, Ben, as you know; across the nation in 2017 alone. That seems to me, like that’s a national emergency.

Shapiro responded:

Certainly, if you’re going to look at the groups most targeted in hate crimes across the United States on a per capita basis, Jews are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans. They are twice as likely to be targeted as gay Americans. The idea that the real threat, when it comes to hate crimes, is largely directed against blacks or against gay folks in the United States — listen, every hate crime is obviously awful and evil, but it’s amazing that the media ignore one form of hate crime. And the reason is — The New York Times admitted this. They said, yeah we’ve had a spate of crimes against Jews in New York City; we don’t cover it because it doesn’t fit our ideological narrative. The people who are doing these assaults are not white supremacists.

He continued, ”Not one of the hate crimes in New York City has been linked to white supremacy.” He returned to the media’s perspective, saying, “And so, we basically, we just ignore it, because it doesn’t fit the narrative that we want to tell.”

Shapiro pointed out why reporting on the series of attacks on Jews was counterproductive to the media’s agenda:

And beyond that, the idea of Jews as victims in United States is on its face boldly absurd, because Jews are such disproportionate winners in the American system. Jews are disproportionately well educated, disproportionately wealthy. And so, if we were to look at hate crimes and say, “Okay, well, we’re going to judge by hate crimes which groups are most victimized,” then it doesn’t make any sense, because Jews are not actually supremely victimized in the United States.” So in order to maintain the idea that America is a racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic place, what you actually have to do is ignore hate crimes against the group most likely to be targeted and instead focus on groups less likely to be targeted in order to maintain the narrative.

Perino asked, “How does this play in 2020? I want to take you to a tweet from Kamala Harris; she’s the senator from the state where you are from; she’s a 2020 candidate. On January 29, she tweeted, ‘This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.’ Yesterday she was asked this; watch this.”

Perino then played a clip of Harris being asked about the tweet, showing her answering, “I think the facts are still unfolding, and I’m very, um, concerned about obviously the initial, um, allegation, that he made about what might have happened and it’s something that we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation, and I think that, um, once the investigation is concluded then we can all comment.”

Perino commented, “It’s interesting to me, Ben, because she’s a former prosecutor, and she was there in California, and she surely came across cases like this where you had to have a little bit of skepticism while also having some care and compassion for the victim that is claiming they’ve been attacked.”

Shapiro replied:

Absolutely. I do love the idea that “the facts are now unfolding.” When this first broke, and there were serious questions to be asked about the account, which was, on its face, rather absurd, and she was immediately jumping to “this is a modern-day lynching”; now, the day that it all falls apart, suddenly we have to “wait for the facts to unfold.” Well, that tells you the narrative that Kamala Harris and so many on the Left want to promote, which is that the Jussie Smollett story is happening, the actual story is happening all over the United States. Cory Booker said something very similar, and so if this thing falls apart, then we just sort of pretend that this never was an issue in the first place? And then we look for other instances to prove that America is a really terrible place and that Trump supporters are really, really awful people. I do love Kamala Harris basically running away from her own tweet there. I mean, it’s really funny, when she’s asked by a reporter not to don a rainbow-sequined jacket …

Perino concluded, “You also need to make sure everyone should be in charge of their own tweets. That’s my general rule and advice. Free of charge today.”

What's the background?

Smollett said he was attacked by two unidentified men about 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures on Jan. 29 on a Chicago street. Smollett, an actor on Fox's ""Empire,"" said the attack was racially motivated. He also said the alleged attackers were Trump supporters who shouted ""MAGA""-related phrases as well as homophobic slurs.

After an investigation, law enforcement sources told multiple media outlets that the Chicago Police Department no longer considered Smollett the victim of an attack. Police sources have also indicated their suspicion that Smollett orchestrated the ""attack"" himself.

Smollett has denied having a role in planning the incident.

You can read more about the latest updates on the case here and here.

What are the details of the 2007 incident?

According to an NBC News report, Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to misdemeanor charges of DUI, driving without a license, and providing false information to a police officer, including false impersonation.

Smollett was sentenced to two years' probation in connection with the incident as well as a choice of a fine or jail time.

NBC News obtained the information from the L.A. City Attorney's office on Tuesday, and reported that the Chicago Police Department has requested the same information to assist in their investigation of January's alleged attack.

Page Six reported that during the 2007 incident, Smollett provided his brother's name after an officer asked his identity. Smollett also signed a fake name on his promise to appear in court.

Records showed that Smollett did complete an alcohol education and treatment program by May 2008.

Dispatches: Weekly TV news

“High School Musical” is hoping to find a new generation of fans with the reinvented “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Currently filming in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 10-episode series for The Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service, Disney+, picks up 15 years after the original movie aired. The action follows a group of students as they prepare for the opening night of their school’s first-ever production of “High School Musical.”

Amazon Prime Video has announced that the fourth and final season of Emmy Award-Winning series “The Man in the High Castle” will premiere this fall. The show is currently being filmed in Vancouver.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.

Contenders: Shows to keep on your radar

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.

In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.

Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.

Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.

Report Card: A look at ratings winners and losers

Winners: “The Cool Kids” has been a steady performer for Fox, increasing its chances of being renewed next season.

Losers: Maybe it still exists in another version of reality but in this one, the science fiction espionage thriller “Counterpart” is no more. The Starz series has been cancelled.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett may end up dodging potential indictment charges thanks to a last-minute phone call his lawyers made to prosecutors, according to a report Wednesday.

The “Hail Mary” call was made Tuesday — just moments before brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were set to testify before a grand jury in Chicago, a source close to the investigation told CBS News.

It’s not exactly clear what Smollett’s lawyers told prosecutors, but it was enough for the Cook County prosecutors to postpone the proceeding.

The grand jury was supposed to begin hearing evidence that could have resulted in the TV actor being indicted on felony charges of filing a false police report.

The brothers reportedly spilled their guts to police after being arrested last week — telling them that they were hired by Smollett to stage the reported hate attack against him Jan. 29.

They also told cops that Smollett was behind a supposed threatening letter he received at “Empire’s” studios in Chicago a week before the alleged assault, according to ABC News. The claim is now being investigated by the FBI and US postal inspectors.

After the Osundairos agreed to cooperate in the investigation, Smollett’s lawyers told police that the star wouldn’t be doing a follow-up interview, a source told CBS.

Roughly a dozen search warrants have been issued — including for the 36-year-old actor’s financial and phone records.

Smollett has blasted his critics, insisting he was the victim of a violent homophobic and racist attack just steps from his apartment in Chicago.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said in his first and only interview last week. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”"

In a statement released Wednesday, 20th Century Fox said, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

When unconfirmed reports surfaced last week that Smollett engineered the attack after learning he was being written off Empire, Fox promptly shot down the speculation, maintaining, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett currently is facing further questioning by the Chicago Police Department after two persons of interest (brothers from Nigeria, one of whom worked as a personal trainer on a music video of Smollett’s) were released on Friday after additional interviews, and without being charged. Chicago PD communications director Anthony Guglielmi said on Saturday, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police … has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Our sister site Deadline in turn quoted a source as saying “the new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.”

Smollett’s lawyers issued a statement late Saturday, saying, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

As for reports that Smollett knew one or both of the Nigerian brothers, his lawyers said, “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett sought treatment at a hospital in Chicago, where Empire is filmed, following his alleged late-January attack, in which two men supposedly approached the actor/singer and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. He performed at an L.A. concert days after the attack, and appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America last week to give his account of the incident, saying that he’s been “forever changed” by it."

A new report from the Daily Mail suggests that Smollett’s most recent “he said/she said” issue with the Chicago Police Department isn’t the first time that he has run into so holes of his version of the truth. Back in 2007, Smollett was pulled over in the Los Angeles area from driving under the influence of alcohol. When police asked his for his name and identification, a then 25-year-old Smollett said that he didn’t have his license and he claimed to be his little brother, Jake Smollett, who was 18-years-old.

The actor was eventually charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence, as well as driving without a license. Smollett ended up pleading no contest in the case and his sentence was reduced to one count of providing false information to the authorities. A year later, Smollett completed an alcohol education and treatment program as part of the crime.

As the Inquisitr previously reported, Smollett told Chicago police authorities that he was subjected to racist and homophobic insults during an attack in his Streeterville neighborhood. The Empire actor told authorities that two white men threw an unknown chemical substance at him and he also reported that the men put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene. Police later found a surveillance video of Jussie walking into his apartment building with a rope around his neck.

Shortly after the reported attack, the Chicago Police released a video of two masked men walking in the area of the incident about 15 to 20 minutes before and police later discovered that the two men in the grainy image were actually friends of Jussie — brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. When they were brought into custody, the Inquisitr reported that the case took a twist.

According to the two brothers, Jussie paid them to stage an attack against him after his first attempt at gaining media attention failed. Previously, the brothers told the CPD that Jussie sent a threatening letter to Fox studios that was laced with a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol. When that story failed to gain steam and didn’t get the media coverage that Jussie had hoped for, he went to drastic measures to stage a fake “racist” and “homophobic” attack against him in order to gain attention from national media.

Since the claims that Jussie had a part in staging the attacks first emerged, he and his lawyers have denied any wrongdoing on his part."

Last month, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two supporters of President Donald Trump in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him as well as “this is MAGA country,” in reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” 2016 campaign slogan.

Smollett also claimed that his attackers tied a rope noose around his neck.

The story isn’t holding up.

It turns out, the Trump-supporting “racists” who attacked Smollett were actually a pair of brothers personally acquainted with Smollett.

“Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack in Streeterville. The brothers, seen on surveillance video near the scene of the alleged attack, told investigators Smollett directed them to buy the rope used in the incident,” Chicago’s local WBBM-TV reported.

Any sensible person could have seen the inconsistencies in Smollett’s story a mile away.

The biggest red flag was the unlikelihood of stereotypical racists attacking Hollywood actors in public while claiming the liberal city of Chicago is “MAGA country.”

Now, new information is revealing that Smollett already had a history of lying to police.

“A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence,” The Associated Press reported Tuesday.

Smollett identified himself as his younger brother, actor and celebrity chef Jake Smollett, after being pulled over and wrote his brother’s name on the promise to appear in court, the AP reported.

That wasn’t a bright idea because the actor ended up being charged with false impersonation as well as driving under the influence and driving without a valid license, the AP reported.

Smollett was sentenced to two years probation at the time.

This gives a clearer picture of Smollett’s character, which was already in question before this report came out.

It was bad enough that Smollett apparently orchestrated a fake hate crime and involved his friends in the hoax, but it looks like he’s the kind of person to throw his own brother under the bus when he’s in trouble.

Smollett obviously has some problems when it comes to telling the truth. A whole slew of Democrat politicians and celebrities are looking pretty foolish over this.

FOX is sticking by Jussie Smollett in the wake of the investigation into the bizarre alleged attack, and they are doubling down that his ""Empire"" character is not in jeopardy.

""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set,"" The Blast was told in a statement from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment.

FOX was forced to respond after reports that Smollett's time on the show was done, but contrary to those reports, the statement doubled down that ""he is not being written out of the show.""

As we reported, the Usondairo brothers were minutes from testifying before a grand jury, but a last minute call from Smollett's attorneys caused the prosecution to take a pause.

Chicago PD are still requesting a follow up interview with the ""Empire,"" star, but he has not made himself available yet. Meanwhile, Smollett has sought out advice from high powered criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos, but we're told Geragos' guidance is strictly for dealing with the media and public.

Many celebrities who once supported Smollett have gone silent since he shifted from victim to suspect, except Cardi B, who is very adamant that the actor ruined Black History Month.

The Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office said Smollett lied to police by giving a false name during a 2007 DUI stop.

“The Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office said that Smollett gave police a false name during a DUI stop; this more than a decade ago,” CNN’s Jim Sciutto said on air Wednesday morning.

On Saturday night, Chicago Police confirmed that the “trajectory” of their investigation into the alleged attack on Smollett had “shifted,” after news outlets reported that police now think the two men arrested last week — Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and his brother Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo — were paid by Smollett to attack him.

Smollett claims that on January 29, masked white attackers wearing MAGA hats had screamed, “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-scented liquid on him. The actor turned over redacted phone records to police, but Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said those records “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” ABC7 Chicago reported.

Two other pieces of evidence seemed to confirm the idea that the attack was a hoax: a hot sauce bottle with bleach-smelling liquid that emerged after the police sweeps (and may have been planted after the fact), and a record showing the rope in question was purchased by the Osundairo brothers nearby.

CNN’s Ryan Young provided more details on the actor’s DUI in Los Angeles. “First of all, he pled no contest in that DUI charge and giving the false name. So he received two years probation for that,” Young reported.

Young noted that Abel and Ola Osundairo turned over their cellphones to police. “We know for a fact that detectives are trying to get the cell phone records for Jussie Smollett and some of his financial records to see if some of these stories blend together,” he added. “You have so many different divergent stories in this now. Police really want to talk to the actor and they want to continue talking to these brothers to see how they can put the storyline together.”

“Guys, this story keeps turning every single day, hour by hour. The last thing I’ll say, over a thousand police hours put into this investigation so far,” Young concluded.

If police can prove that Smollett was lying and perpetrating a hoax, they will likely charge him with filing a false report. This is a serious charge and may land the actor in jail. These one thousand hours of police time spent on a hate hoax mean that Smollett has tied down law enforcement, making police less effective in keeping the peace in Chicago.

Dispatches: Weekly TV news

“High School Musical” is hoping to find a new generation of fans with the reinvented “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Currently filming in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 10-episode series for The Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service, Disney+, picks up 15 years after the original movie aired. The action follows a group of students as they prepare for the opening night of their school’s first-ever production of “High School Musical.”



Amazon Prime Video has announced that the fourth and final season of Emmy Award-Winning series “The Man in the High Castle” will premiere this fall. The show is currently being filmed in Vancouver.



“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.



Contenders: Shows to keep on your radar

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.



In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.



Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.



Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.



Report Card: A look at ratings winners and losers

Winners: “The Cool Kids” has been a steady performer for Fox, increasing its chances of being renewed next season.



Losers: Maybe it still exists in another version of reality but in this one, the science fiction espionage thriller “Counterpart” is no more. The Starz series has been cancelled.

The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers, who were identified to multiple media outlets by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. The men were released from custody without charges, and police later requested another interview with Smollett.

The Osundairos’ attorney has not responded to multiple requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

As I normally try to stray from the hyperbolic it is sometimes difficult to use terms that trend close to that definition. So it is with a touch of unease when I say that Mike Rowe is a national institution, but I say it in earnest. He is what is needed in this country, and he appears imbued with more common sense and pragmatism than can be contained within a solitary figure.

The former host of “Dirty Jobs” has a number of media offerings these days, and you would be satisfied with any of his content. Of particular note is his podcast, “The Way I Heard It”. These are brief stories of real people with notable twists, in the same vein as Paul Harvey’s “The Rest Of The Story”.

Rowe recently posted a tale on his FaceBook page that does quite a lot: it sums him up as man, it reveals a piece of America in a style all his own, and it typifies the kind of character we actually harbor in this country that is eclipsed by all of the angst and outrage we are presented on a daily basis. Mike Rowe is a great tonic to that political bile.

Most writers have an appreciation for encounters; those unexpected meetings that transpire and, if you are blessed with a proper ear or gifted with conversation, reveal something poignant. Rowe tells us of just such an episode he had, made all the better that he was at a drinking establishment.

So I’m at the bar last night, waiting for my drink to arrive, when the man beside me orders a “Clint.”

“A Clint?” says the bartender.

The man reaches into his pocket and offers the bartender a business card. The bartender examines the card and nods his head.

“One Clint, coming up!”

I turn to the man beside me, who appears to be the same age as my father. “It’s none of my business,” I say, “but what the hell is a Clint?”

The man smiles and hands me his card. “Keep it,” he says. “Might come in handy sometime.”

Now, I fully realize my years in covering politics and the fetid moral swamp that is Hollywood (to say nothing of the wallow in social media) has overdeveloped my cynical muscle. The barrage of bias from the mainstream media has only ramped up that bulk, serving as a cynicism steroid, if you will. This does serve a useful purpose, at times. The night Jussie Smollett’s “attack” claims broke, as an example, my radar binged loudly with a DOUBT IT flashing alarm.

Yet, often I have to check myself when reading Rowe because his sublime flair for the casual dramatics sometimes has me wondering if he is trending into that familiar journalistic practice of “fabulousness”. On occasion, he feels like he has ambled over to that embellished realm, not unlike Jean Sheppard, the narrator of the classic “A Christmas Story”.

But that is on me; I’m the one with the issue. Because, just as I am saying to myself “This bar story is almost too right”, Rowe calmly takes my shoulders and steers me back onto the correct path. He has a picture of the very card that Clint offered to he hooch-slinger, and to Rowe as well.

And so, after being properly corrected and given proof of this very basic claim, I read on with Mike’s account.

“May I assume you’re the Clint for which the drink is named?” I ask.

“You may,” says Clint.

“And may I further assume you’re a man who has grown weary of describing a drink no one has ever heard of?”

“You may,” says Clint.

We shake hands, and I make no further assumptions about the man with a taste for pink cocktails. We chat some more though, and I soon learn that Clint has spent his life in law enforcement. Specifically, I learn that he worked with the secret service.

Rowe happened upon Clint Hill, a man who served as a Secret Service agent under five administrations. This is the kind of encounter a writer savors experiencing. That a man like Mike Rowe did is all the better. His touch, his tone, and his very gentle frankness are perfectly suited to this type of meeting.

As to be expected, Mr. Hill has an expansive personal history, one that has led to him writing no fewer than three memoirs on his life working on the White House detail. Rowe noted this obviousness, and he encouraged people to look further into Mr. Hill’s personal history. And here is where you can see the benefit of taking time to back away from the cesspit that is our contemporary politics.

After Mike Rowe’s post on Monday, Clint Hill’s book “Five Presidents” has taken on a renewed interest — and this is not some manufactured press event for a new release. The book has been out of circulation for three years, and still, it received enough notice from Mike’s mention, and his post, that for a time it moved to the top of the sales chart.

It serves as a perfect emblem of what we can do in our times. Ease back from the hype and the venom we are served and seek out the items that reflect what we are truly made from. If even for a day a man like Clint Hill can surpass the swamp-like content of Andrew McCabe then things are not so bad around here. And, as a capper, Rowe can help me to occasionally drop that shield of cynicism that is required in the social battlefield.

Sometimes, haggling like this over the presentation of a cocktail is all the conflict we need from this world.

Especially over the past week, Smollett’s story has disintegrated to the point that he’s reportedly being scaled back by the FOX series. His entire career could very well go down the drain if his account turns out to be false, and while the Chicago PD continues probing the case, The Daily Show‘s Trevor Noah addressed the matter in a forthright manner during a between-the-scenes segment when an audience member asked for his take:

“I don’t know what the details of the Jussie Smollett story are going to end up being. What I do know is right now, the story just doesn’t make sense in the pieces that it’s laid out as. I’m not saying that he is lying. I’m just saying that his story doesn’t seem to line up with what’s happening.”

Noah continued and drew chuckles when he asked, “Like, why are two Nigerian guys walking around in Chicago’s freezing weather and then shouting ‘This is MAGA country’?” Further, he added, “That’s a weird thing to shout as a Nigerian person.” Noah also believes this story is now “a home run” for Trump after “so many people jumped on board before they even waited to see what it was about.” Ultimately, the host believes that this story illustrates how people are too eager “at jumping at stories that confirm their biases,” rather than stepping back and critically viewing each story on an individual basis.

Indeed, and with allegations of a staged attack swirling — police reportedly suspect that Smollett may have rehearsed the attack with the two brothers who are no longer considered suspects — public figures including Cardi B believe that Smollett, if culpable, has “f*cked up black history month.”

Meanwhile, Variety has spoken with legal experts that say Smollett could face jail time if he’s found guilty of lying to the police and fabricating the attack. A further complication arrives with CBS Los Angeles revealing how, a decade ago, Smollett did lie to police by telling him that he was his brother, actor Jake Smollett, when he was pulled over for a DUI. And for unknown reasons, Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx has recused herself from the case."

CBS News reports this morning that the “Hail Mary” call worked — at least for now:

A source tells CBS News that a last-minute phone call might have kept the case against ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett from going to a grand jury. The actor claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack last month, as he walked home in the middle of the night. pic.twitter.com/4E9zG9rJNn — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) February 20, 2019

A source close to the investigation tells CBS News the brothers were set to appear in front of a grand jury Tuesday. But CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds reports those plans were abruptly scrapped after a “Hail Mary” call from Smollett’s defense team. CBS News has learned that Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were waiting outside the grand jury chambers, just minutes from testifying, when prosecutors got the call from Smollett’s lawyers. It’s unclear what the defense said, but the Cook County state’s attorney decided to postpone the brothers’ testimony, which would have been the first step toward indicting the 36-year-old actor for filing a false police report.

Hmmmm. The grand-jury move came after Smollett stopped cooperating with the investigation, refusing requests for a follow-up interview. CBS also reports that prosecutors have now issued a number of search warrants for Smollett’s financial and phone records, and this time not the heavily redacted copies Smollett first provided police. That’s a lot of pressure on someone who might have something significant to hide. If prosecutors were willing to postpone the Osundairos’ testimony, they must have gotten some promises of more cooperation in exchange.

Of course, that may not matter much anyway. As noted earlier and also in the video above, the two brothers now allegedly claim that Smollett engineered the threat letter that contained white powder — aspirin, as it turns out — sent to Empire’s production company. The FBI has now reportedly entered the probe in relation to that development, signaling a more ominous turn for Smollett and a lot more work for his attorneys. A charge of filing a false police report is peanuts next to the serious federal felonies involving threats sent by US mail.

If so, the call may not have been much of a “Hail Mary” play at all. It might have been a recognition that this case has grown beyond the local grand jury, and that the big question now involves more than just public humiliation for Smollett if he did indeed perpetrate two hoax attacks. His defense team has to be looking for a way out of what looks like a self-built trap."

*Funnyman/radio talk show host Godfrey, like the rest of us, is totally confused with the Jussie Smollet case ’cause it sure looks like homeboy is straight up lying about his alleged beatdown and the noose, etc.

TMZ caught up with comic outside of the Laugh Factory in Hollywood last night (02-19-19) and when asked by the camera guy what his thoughts on Smollet’s situation, Godfrey cracked that the “Empire” actor might have mental issues. Whoa. Really?

Like a lot of other folks, Godfrey says he feels used, because Jussie Smollett’s story tapped into racial sensitivities and took advantage of the divisive climate these days. He also points out certain details of the alleged attack he finds shady … like how Trump supporters don’t watch “Empire.”

Hmm, that’s an interesting and salient point … we think.

Anyway, as far as the SiriusXM talker/comedian is concerned, it’s time for Smollett to start saying sorry … apologizing to everyone he’s hurt including the gay community, the black community … and even the MAGA fans it appears he lied on.

So what kind of punishment should receive if it’s proved he lied? Well, Godfrey believes it’s already begun … and it’s a perfect plot line for the “Empire” star. Or is it soon to be EX-“Empire” star?

In other news involving Jussie Smollett …. TMZ is reporting that the ONLY way he keep a grand jury investigation from going forward is to meet with police and somehow convince them the alleged attack was not a hoax like it looking.

As reported, in the wake of the their meeting with Ola and Abel Osundairo … who told them that Smollett paid them to rough him up, police “urgently” want a follow-up interview with him.

Cops have called his legal reps, but as of now, haven’t heard back. The guessing is that sthings are kinda on hold in Smollett’s camp because he’s reportedly hire Hollywood Criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos.

Chicago cops are said to be waiting to see if Geragos makes contact with them. Sources say if Jussie Smollett refuses to speak with police the case will go directly to the grand jury.

Get another bag of popcorn. The thrill-ride continues!"

Foxx recused herself from the Jussie Smollet case in February pointing to a possible conflict based on her knowing a potential witness.

On Tuesday March 26, it was reported that the Foxx’s office closed its case against the ‘Empire’ actor and Smollet’s lawyers announced that the dismissal is a vindication of their client, who they described as a victim.

CBS Chicago reported that the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office said in a statement, “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.”

And it’s reported a judge has ordered the case files sealed.

In a statement last month, Foxx, 36, said her decision to take herself off the high-profile case was to “address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnessed in the case.”

But some asked to what witnesses specifically is she referring and what is her connection. Others, however, are saying that the county’s top prosecutor is displaying integrity and it should be left at that.

But the twisting and turning controversial Smollet case has led to more questions than answers.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. ‘Empire’ Actor Jussie Smollet Said 2 Masked ‘MAGA’ Men Attacked Him & Put a Noose Around His Neck in a Homophobic Assault. That Story Has Unraveled But Now the Case is Dropped

Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on “Empire,” is gay. His detailed account of the attack was not supported by evidence, police said. Smollet claimed he was jumped in downtown Chicago in late January by two men in masks who shouted racist and gay slurs including, “This is MAGA country!” He said the assailants placed a noose around his neck and doused him with some substance and then took off.

Smollet received tremendous support on social media from myriad public figures and appeared on talk shows to tell his story.

Weeks later, police picked up brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, both are actors who have appeared in the show.

It’s been reported that Smollet hired them for a staged attack. Smollet through his lawyer has denied this allegation. The case headed to a grand jury and charges were filed.

A month later, all chagres were dropped.

2. Foxx Said She’s Stepping Away to Avoid a Conflict of Interest. She Spoke at ‘Raising Our Voices: Supporting More Women in Hollywood & Politics’

According to NBC Chicago, a spokesperson for Foxx emailed a statement that read, “Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No other explanation was offered, it was reported.

Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats will take over the Smollet case.

Meanwhile, some want specifics on why she’s stepped away.

“She definitely should explain… and the fact that she feels she doesn’t owe the people who elected her an explanation is a problem for me,” one wrote on the Fox32 Chicago Facebook post.

But others say she’s doing the right thing and caution that there should be no “rush to judge.”

“If Kim Foxx says it’s a conflict of interest why not take her word, she must have her reason. If she had stayed on the case and later the media found there was a conflict they would be calling for her to step down. Don’t rush to judge until all the facts are in,” one commented.

Another wrote, “It’s called professional INTEGRITY??? I know in this political climate that’s a strange concept. I praise her for not compromising the investigation if there is a personal connection…”

Foxx was a speaker at the EMILY’s List-sponsored Raising Our Voices: Supporting More Women in Hollywood & Politics forum in Los Angeles Tuesday. She was among Hollywood actors including Amber Tamblyn and Olivia Munn.

3. Foxx is the First African-American Female Cook County State’s Attorney

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office is the second largest prosecutor’s office in the country.

According to her bio, Foxx, who took office in December of 2016, had a “vision for transforming the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office into a fairer, more forward-thinking agency focused on rebuilding the public trust, promoting transparency, and being proactive in making all communities safe.”

The official biography on Foxx reads that she’s “undertaken substantial reform.”

Foxx’s accomplishments include overhauling the state’s attorney’s office’s “Conviction Integrity Unit, resulting in overturned convictions in over 20 cases, including the first-ever mass exoneration in Cook County for 15 men whose convictions stemmed from misconduct by a Chicago police officer.”

Foxx is credited with being a “leader in bond (bail) reform, instructing prosecutors to agree to recognizance bonds where appropriate, and reviewing bond decisions in cases where people are detained because they are unable to pay bonds of $1,000 or less. And, she’s “taken the lead on prioritizing resources away from low-level offenses, including raising the threshold for approving felony charges for retail theft to $1,000, and declining to prosecute misdemeanor traffic offenses for failure to pay tickets and fines.”

4. Foxx Has a Long History in Cook County & Has Advocated For Children & Justice System Reform. She Urged R. Kelly Victims Step Forward

Foxx served as an Assistant State’s Attorney for more than a decade and was a guardian ad litem; an attorney advocating for children navigating the child welfare system.

Before her election as state’s attorney in 2016, she was the Chief of Staff for the Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.

According to her bio on the Cook County website, “she was the lead architect of the county’s criminal justice reform agenda to address racial disparities in the criminal and juvenile justice systems.”

When TMZ broke the news about Smollett’s assault last month, they carried his claim that his attackers uttered pro-Donald Trump slogans among their alleged racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s claims have come under massive scrutiny since then, and the Chicago Police Department wants to interview him again due to recent suspicions that he might’ve staged the incident.

When Levin spoke about these developments to Fox, Bill Hemmer asked him “why did you believe it” when TMZ ran their initial story.

“I didn’t say I believed it,” Levin said. “What we said was ‘this is what Jussie said.’ I never said I believed it. We reported what Jussie said happened.”

Levin continued to justify his report by remarking on how the police said they were treating Smollett as a victim at the time. As Levin talked about how TMZ learned Smollett’s side of the story, he went through the reasons why Smollett’s supposed behavior was a surprise to so many, even as Hemmer and Sandra Smith pressed him to make sense of how the story has played out.

“Do you play back the events in your mind as to how you originally reported this and, perhaps, maybe a sense of apprehension in the future when stories like these cross,” Hemmer asked.

“I would absolutely report that story again,” Levin answered. He went on to say that the problem was with those who might’ve jumped to conclusions on Smollett’s story while it was still developing.

“There are two ways of looking at this: one is are you reporting the story? Of course you are reporting the story. But people who made judgments about the story…that’s where you got a problem, that people jump to conclusions just hearing allegations now. That’s where we are right now in our society. That’s a big problem. That is a big problem and there are a lot of people who did that and now they’re pulling it back. In terms of reporting it, I would do exactly that again.”

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he says.

Feb. 19

— Chicago police say investigate a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided."

CHICAGO — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

................................................................

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

................................................................

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

................................................................

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

“Paul Manafort could well die in jail. He’s a crippled man. We’ve now heard harrowing tales about what’s happening to him in prison,” Gergen said during an appearance on CNN’s “Outfront” on Monday, referring to another former Trump adviser who pleaded guilty to eight felony charges in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“Roger Stone must also worry that if he goes there, he’s seen as something of a dandy,” Gergen added. “Will he be physically safe? Will he be subject to rape? There must be a lot of things that are going through his mind.”

The moment took place during a discussion of Stone’s ongoing legal troubles, including his most recent decision to post an Instagram image of the presiding judge in his case with crosshairs in the background. He later apologized and deleted the post. Last month, he pleaded not guilty to felony charges of obstruction of justice, witness tampering and making false statements.

The “rape” moment largely flew by anchor Kate Bolduan, who was filling in for the show’s normal host, Erin Burnett. A rep for CNN did not immediately respond to request for comment from TheWrap.

Stone, who is under a court gag order, had no comment.

It’s not the first time a CNN talking head has been accused of crass speculation about a potential Stone prison sentence. Last month, anchor Jake Tapper said during a panel discussion that Stone “might like” going to prison, a comment that Stone and a number of online critics took as a veiled homophobic remark.

“Why did Jake Tapper insinuate that I was gay and gleefully proclaim that I would ‘like it’ in prison,” Stone told TheWrap.

A CNN spokesperson said that Tapper was referring to Stone’s love of attention and the spotlight.

Stone has long side-stepped questions about his personal life, telling an activist in a video interview in 2017, “Why is that anyone’s business? … I’m trysexual. I’ve tried everything.”"

On a number of occasions, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco and the gang have shown their undying support to their fanbase and the television community too.

In 2017 it was reported that the original main cast members Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar all took pay cuts back to support of Mayim Bialik and Melissa Raunch and give them a rise.

At the time, it was alleged that the OGs opted to take home $1 million (£800,000) per episode for their work on the CBS sitcom so they could free up money and allow Mayim and Melissa, who joined in season four, to double their salary of $200,000 (£160,000) per episode to $450,000 (£360,000) an episode.

Legends, right?

Creating a flash mob for the studio audience

The cast well and truly adore their fans and to prove it, they orchestrated a flash mob for their studio audience earlier in the month.

Kaley said the performance might well be her favourite memory of working on the show for the last 12 years and same, tbh.

Making personalised videos for fans

Last month the cast sent not one, not two, but three heartwarming videos to a four-year-old boy battling an inoperable brain tumour.

Dublin boy Oscar Keogh received the clips after his mum had reached out to Melissa Rauch, who plays his favourite character, to ask whether she could send a signed picture.

So naturally, the family were absolutely delighted when they saw that Melissa had roped in Jim and the rest of the gang to record three personalised messages.

Yup, they really are the bomb.

Sharing behind the scenes gossip

Mayim is a trooper at answering fan questions in videos posted to her YouTube page, giving audiences an insight into all things Bazinga.

Over the past year, she’s told us her own personal reactions to finding out the show was coming to an end, to how Amy Farrah Fowler’s wedding dress.

More recently, Mayim has revealed that she’s never watched a full episode back and why she doesn’t let her kids watch the series either.

Visiting a superfan on his deathbed

Mayim, Melissa and Simon went and visited superfan Joe Steiger’s bedside during a hospital stay in 2017.

‘I’m forever grateful and indebted to them,’ Joe wrote on his Instagram at the time.

The cast later paid tribute to Joe after learning the news that he passed away in August 2018, with Mayim writing: ‘Three days ago, I exchanged messages with our TBBT superfan @joesteiger as we often do in the years since I met him.

‘He was feeling especially motivated to try and make the journey to Los Angeles to see a taping of the show that brought him so much joy.

‘Joe was taken from this Earth yesterday at the age of 31 after losing his battle with Muscular Dystrophy. Our hearts are broken and we send prayers and wishes to his family.

‘Joe was endlessly positive and funny and tender and thoughtful. He saw himself as someone who could change the way people thought about disability, challenges, and the power of communication even when it seems impossible. May his memory only be for a blessing.’

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.

“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”

Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. Update: NBC News reported Tuesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanor counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the L.A. City Attorney’s office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.

Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.

“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.

“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.

Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.

“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”

Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.

“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.”

Kavanaugh of sexual assault and the drum-banging American Indian who confronted Catholic high school students on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

In the rush to speak too soon about the Smollett case, Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker stand out.

According to the New York Post, the misdemeanour complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September that year says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake, when he was asked by an officer.

He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court.

Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a license.

Court records show he pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to DUI and driving without a valid license counts.

Smollett, now 36, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a choice of a fine or a jail stint, an LA city attorney’s spokesman told NBC News.

He later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

Multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the current probe told NBC News that the Chicago Police Department has requested the details from their counterparts in Los Angeles.

The old case came to light as authorities investigate whether the Empire actor concocted a story about being attacked by Trump-loving racists with a noose and bleach near his apartment in Chicago on Jan. 29.

And federal investigators are probing whether Smollett was involved in sending a suspicious threat letter to himself a week before the alleged attack.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions levelled on social media that he had been less than co-operative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 per cent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he says.

Feb. 19

— Chicago police say investigate a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided.

The actor is facing intense public scrutiny after new evidence shows that he played a part in orchestrating a hoax and then gave the Chicago Police Department an untruthful report. Even most of his own fans no longer believe his story as additional details continue to emerge making him look more guilty than ever. Law enforcement is now launching a full investigation into what really happened and Smollett may face charges if he is suspected of false reporting. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx is not having any part in this controversial case and has excused herself from the investigation, according to ABC News.

Proving Smollett’s innocence at this point will be a difficult job. The actor went from being supported and sympathized by much of the nation to being laughed at in a mere matter of days. The main question people are concerned with now isn’t whether or not Smollett faked the attack. Rather, they want to know why he would risk his entire career for such an elaborate lie.

Kim Foxx’s office recently announced that she has rescued herself from the case.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.”

First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats will take Foxx’s place as the state attorney for the case.

Jussie Smollett allegedly wanted ""bigger reaction"" from threatening letter https://t.co/r51KoKMixP pic.twitter.com/XH0RB4SyWB — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 20, 2019

Smollett originally claimed that two men targeted him in a hate-fueled attack. He said they shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him before assaulting him and tying a rope around his neck. While two brothers were originally arrested for possibly having a connection to the case, they were quickly released and are no longer considered suspects. They informed police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. They refuted any claims that they are racist or homophobic in a public statement.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

New reports suggest that Smollett orchestrated the fake attack because of a threatening letter he received last month that he felt didn’t receive enough attention by law enforcement. According to Smollett, the racist letter included a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree. He said the letter included no return address, but simply said “MAGA” in red letters. The FBI is investigating the letter to see if Smollett could have sent it to himself."

Chicago’s top prosecutor recused herself from the investigation into the attack reported by Empire actor Jussie Smollett shortly after police requested another interview with the actor.

The office of Cook county state’s attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted” after detectives released two Nigerian brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men abused him with racist and homophobic slurs before beating him up early on 29 January. Smollett, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Lawyers for Smollett were meeting with prosecutors and police investigators on Wednesday, a police official said.

Earlier in the day Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character isn’t being written off the show. The statement follows reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police later requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf”. Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2am near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted: “This is Maga country,” an apparent reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation”."

Cardi is the latest celeb to comment on Jussie Smollett and she’s got some strong opinions about the “Empire” star’s possible Lyon. Cardi went live on Instagram this weekend to shun Jussie for possibly fabricating that extensive hate crime story.

According to Bardi if Jussie really did lie about what happened then he’s officially ruined Black History Month.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett—whatever the f—k his name is. I’m really disappointed in him,” said Bardi. “I feel like he f–ked up Black History Month, bro. God damn!”

She added however that she’s holding out hope that Jussie’s telling the truth, especially considering Chicago PD’s history of racism.

“Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s–t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because, you know … police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar,” she said.

She then shared a personal story, in which she was falsely accused of a crime and police put her in a headlock and accused her of lying. With that in mind, Cardi says she can’t blindly accept what police are saying—but if Jussie did lie it’s a cry for attention.

“I want to see what else. I want to see. I want to know because if he did that, he really f–ked up, bro, because it’s February. You have so many people standing for you. Why would you do that, bro? Is attention that necessary for y’all nowadays?”

So far here’s where Jussie’s story stands;

Nigerian brothers Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo were arrested in connection with the crime. The men admitted through their attorney that they know Jussie but denied being involved in the attack.

Investigators revealed on Friday that two suspects were questioned in connection with the alleged attack, but were released without charges “due to new evidence.”

Chicago police said on Saturday that Smollett was no longer considered a victim in their investigation and Jussie’s vehemently denying that this was a hoax.

Do YOU agree with Cardi that Jussie’s alleged lie could ruin Black History Month???"

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.



Contenders: Shows to keep on your radar

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.



In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.



Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.



Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.



Report Card: A look at ratings winners and losers

Winners: “The Cool Kids” has been a steady performer for Fox, increasing its chances of being renewed next season.



Losers: Maybe it still exists in another version of reality but in this one, the science fiction espionage thriller “Counterpart” is no more. The Starz series has been cancelled.

Here’s an installment of WackyWednesday, in case you missed it.

No one can be all things. If you can sing like a miraclebird, you’re probably not also the greatest football player; if you’re the fastest person on the planet, it’s doubtful you’re also its best chef; if your immaculate physical appearance rakes in millions, then I’m sorry — you’re probably not also breathtakingly smart.

It’s just a statistical reality. There is balance to the Force.

However you think the distribution of strengths and weaknesses manifests itself in Hollywood actress Alyssa Milano, on the political astuteness side, she’s really, really weak.

Like…really weak. Like here, here, here, here, and here.

Continuing a slew of embarrassing statements over the last year — each one making me sadder than the last — Alyssa recently used her eagle eyes to see the Make America Great Again hat for what it really is.

Take it away, weakness — courtesy of 1 month ago:

“The red MAGA hat is the new white hood. Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.”

The red MAGA hat is the new white hood. Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself. #FirstThoughtsWhenIWakeUp — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 20, 2019

This is just how it seems to me: Maybe you shouldn’t internationally blurt your first thoughts upon waking. That may not be your clearest moment.

Moving on — Alyssa’s winceworthy tweet reveals she has:

no understanding of red MAGA hats and what they represent.

no understanding of the KKK and what they did.

no understanding of whites.

no understanding of boys.

no understanding of how to understand.

PERFECT SCORE.

🙁

Instead of tweeting her first ideas post-sleep, perhaps it’d be nice for her to speak her mind after learning about stuff.

Example (just 1 day prior):

The man that boy is harassing in the video is Nathan and he’s a veteran. pic.twitter.com/dellmT0Isb — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 19, 2019

And what’d she do, once the Covington jig was up? A great big stick-to-dumbness:

Let’s not forget—this entire event happened because a group of boys went on a school-sanctioned trip to protest against a woman’s right to her own body and reproductive healthcare. It is not debatable that bigotry was at play from the start. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 21, 2019

DANG IT.

Back to Alyssa’s castigation of the MAGA hat: She’s not alone.

Over the last week, we’ve learned a great deal about a hoax perpetrated by Empire actor Jussie Smollett (here, here, here, and here). He claimed two MAGA thugs attacked him, shouting racial and gay slurs and covering him with a chemical and a noose. Before that, he claimed a Trump terrorist sent him a ransom-note-style letter suggesting he be shot and hanged, also with racial and gay slurs.

Many on the Left raged, indignant. But the fact is, they were already raging. They already believed — not just before Jussie, but before Covington, too. And now that both stories are proving to have been fake news, those shouting eggheads hardboiled by the waters of untruths much older than 30 days will continue to steam, neck-deep in haughty fury. And though they may, at times — like Alyssa Milano — believe they encounter such ruminations upon first awaking, the reality is that waking up is something — I regret to say — they’re unlikely to ever do.

On MSNBC’s “Politics Nation” Sunday, Sharpton said his call for “maximum” penalties still applies if it should turn out that the whole thing was a hoax. “I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” he said, Page Six reported. “I still maintain that. And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

In response, Donald Trump Jr., who’s been chronicling the reactions of various high-profile figures on the Left to the Smollett case, noted the “irony” of Sharpton’s past regarding hate hoaxes — but also gave him credit for being “ahead of the pack” on the situation, particularly compared to Democratic presidential candidates.

“Given the irony here of the past, it really says something that Sharpton is ahead of the pack of all the Democratic Presidential Hopefuls in condemning this terrible act of hate,” Trump wrote. “Shocked that after jumping all over it when the narrative suited them now suddenly they wont [sic] comment.”

Trump’s “irony” comment is a reference to Sharpton’s infamous role in the Tawana Brawley hoax. As The Daily Wire’s Ashe Schow noted Tuesday, though Sharpton is now calling for maximum accountability for Smollett, he himself managed to get off pretty easy for his role in “one of the most famous rape and race hoaxes in modern American history.” Schow provides some background (formatting adjusted):

In 1987, teenager Tawana Brawley claimed she was raped by a group of white men who wrote racial slurs on her body, smeared her with feces and wrapped her in a plastic bag. Sharpton jumped to her defense, and the case not only inflamed racial tensions in the U.S., but also launched his career as a prominent race-baiter. Brawley named several prominent men as her attackers — including a former assistant district attorney — and while they suffered greatly, she only started paying defamation damages six years ago after her employer was ordered to garnish her wages.

So how much did Sharpton end up paying? While he was ordered to $65,000 in defamation damages, after he failed to pay for years, his supporters ended up paying it back.

As for the responses of the “Democratic Presidential Hopefuls” to the Smollett case, here’s how three of them handled the initial claim versus how they’ve responded to the latest developments:

“Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” wrote Sen. Kamala Harris (CA) when the story fit the progressive narrative. Since the narrative has shifted, she now says she’s “not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,” declared Sen. Cory Booker (NJ) when the alleged attack was first reported. Now, he wants to wait until “all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

“This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it,” said Gillibrand initially. Now, she’s also apparently withholding judgment.

*Gay Black men are giving Don Lemon the side-eye following his recent appearance on Jada Pinkett Smith’s Facebook series, Red Table Talk.

Lemon’s comments about his dating preferences has sparked debate online after he seemed to suggest that the reason he prefers to date white males is because gay Black males are mostly on the DL (down low).

In a clip posted to Jada’s Instagram, Lemon reveals that many of the Black men he privately dated “were on the down low.”

Let him tell it in the clip above

“It’s almost like cultural appropriation, I want to have the fun, but I don’t want to live that way forever,” Lemon stated.

“After a few drinks you’re like, ‘Whoa, wait a minute, are you hitting on me?’” he added.

“But a week later, you don’t want to show up at my house with a rose and say are we having dinner, you can’t deal with that part, but you can deal with the other part,” Lemon said.

“But you don’t want to deal with the romance and the reality of let’s build a home together.”

Corey Andrew of instinctmagazine.com responded to Lemon’s comments, writing:

Being black, gay and male does not automatically put us all into a monolithic existence. Don’s personal struggles are uniquely his and according to celebrity gossip site Madam Noire, Don expressed to Jada Pinkett Smith, daughter Willow and grandmother Adrienne that, “Relationships With Black Men Didn’t Work Because They Weren’t Out.“ This is where I find myself giving him the boy-bye side eye. Really Don? None of us were out? You couldn’t find one black, out, proud, gay male to date in the 80s and 90s?

Lemon went on to say that he’s been in conversation with Jussie Smollett, about his alleged racially-charged hate crime in Chicago.

“For Black, gay men – historically, Black men have stayed in the closet – you have to decide, ‘Do I want to be black, or do I want to be gay?’ And sometimes some of us say we’re too Black to be gay or are we too gay to be Black,” he told Jada Pinkett Smith.

He continued, “So you’ve got it from your own folks or from the larger community, and it hurts. It’s a weight.”"

As the police investigation into Jussie Smollett‘s alleged attack continues to deepen, more and more info is coming out about that January night itself — as well as the Empire actor’s past.

According to a report in NBC News, the California native previously pleaded no contest to three charges in a 2007 case in Los Angeles: DUI, driving without a license, and providing false information to law enforcement.

In that case, the now 36-year-old was sentenced to two years probation and the choice of fine or jail time, according to a Los Angeles City Attorney’s spokesperson.

Obviously, being charged with providing false information to law enforcement back then is a hell of a head-scratcher, considering Chicago cops are now looking into whether Smollett may have staged his own alleged attack.

Per sources close to the investigation, the city’s police officials have apparently requested that the LAPD provide them with information about that 2007 arrest, too. Wow!

Per that same NBC News article, cops are saying the star “is neither considered a victim nor a suspect,” as they are waiting to hear his side of the story in a second interview — but they ARE shifting the focus of their investigation towards the possibility that a false police report has been filed.

Speaking of that potential second interview… TMZ is reporting on Wednesday morning that Jussie can “stave off” a grand jury investigation if — and only if — he meets with cops again and can somehow convince them the alleged attack was real.

Chicago cops have reportedly sent a call out to his lawyers warning them that if he doesn’t come in ASAP for a second interview to clear things up, the case will definitely go to the grand jury.

TMZ also reports that Smollett may have hired Mark Geragos, a high-profile defense attorney, as his new counsel. If that’s the case, it’s on Geragos to quickly defend him from what seems to be the increasing likelihood of a grand jury.

Not too many great options here!

What do U think, Perezcious readers?? Is a grand jury inevitable at this point, or will Jussie come forward and re-convince cops of his innocence?

Jussie Smollett is “angered and devastated” by reports that he paid two friends to help him stage his alleged hate crime attack in Chicago.

Over the weekend, reports emerged that law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said that Chicago police believed the Empire star rehearsed the attack with the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested in connection with the attack and also paid them $3,500, promising them an additional $500 when they returned to the U.S. from a trip to Nigeria.

As we previously reported, the brothers—Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo—are friends with Jussie, according to their lawyer, and have appeared as extras on Empire. One can be seen in the background of this screengrab from Season 2.

Police said the brothers are the shadowy figures captured by surveillance cameras the night Smollett says he was attacked. They were released from police custody Friday night (Feb. 15) after reportedly agreeing to cooperate with the investigation.

Chicago police said they were “eager” to re-interview Jussie Smollett in light of the claims he orchestrated his attack and after the brothers reportedly confirmed to them that they were paid for their services and rehearsed the attack with the Empire star.

But Jussie has so far stuck to his story. He was attacked and he had nothing to do with it, and he doesn’t appreciate claims that suggest otherwise.

The 36-year-old’s team of attorneys released the following statement:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. “Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Smollett told police he was attacked by the two masked men in Chicago around 2 a.m. on January 29th while he was walking to a Subway near his apartment. He said the men, who he believed were whit, yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured a chemical believed to be bleach on him, put a rope around his neck and yelled “this is MAGA country!”

The day the Osundairo brothers were arrested, police raided their home and seized bleach, a “black facemask hat,” an Empire script, shoes, electronics, receipts, and other items.

“When the police came, I kept the clothes on. I kept the rope,” Smollett told Good Morning America‘s Robin Roberts in his first (and so far only) interview since the alleged attack. “I mean, it wasn’t like wrapped around, but yeah it was around because I wanted them to see. I wanted them to see what this was.”"

We have many members of the black community and the LGBT community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crime — and we believe that is a lie — certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes.”

Prosecutors decided to postpone the testimony, reports CBS News in Chicago, even as the brothers were waiting just outside the courtroom at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse. Lawyers for the ""Empire"" star contacted the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office but is unclear what was said.

A grand jury hearing would be the first step toward possibly indicting Smollett.

Also on Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case. A spokesperson explained, ""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.""

It has also come to light that in 2007, Jussie Smollett pleaded no contest to giving false information, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. During the arrest, Smollett allegedly gave his brother's name and signed a false name on the promise to appear in court.

As The Blast previously reported, Smollett really wants Mark Geragos to join his team, especially after the legal powerhouse scored a gigantic settlement for Colin Kaepernick in a grievance case against the NFL.

We’re told Smollett is depending on his legal team in Chicago to handle the ongoing investigation into his alleged attack, as well as any other criminal issues that may arise out of that investigation.

However, the actor needs help dealing with the media, so he’s seeking outside counsel with someone who will be able to answer questions from the press and conduct interviews."

Chicago has around 3x the murders of NYC, and a PD less than half the size. People need to understand just how egregious @JussieSmollett taking a dozen detectives off those crimes to waste time on his hoax was. He must be prosecuted. #JussieSmollettHoax — John Cardillo (@johncardillo) February 17, 2019

“Chicago has around 3x the murders of NYC, and a PD less than half the size,” Cardillo said.

Verdict: False

The FBI reported that Chicago had about two times as many murders as New York City in 2017. The city had about a third as many police officers as New York City in 2017.

Fact Check:

Cardillo cited the statistics as part of an argument that Jussie Smollett, an actor on the Fox television show “Empire,” wasted police resources and time by alleging that he was the victim of a racially motivated attack in January that some sources later said was staged. More than a dozen detectives were working on the case, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.

“He had superficial injuries, and while the ‘hate crime’ component was there, it was highly unusual to assign a dozen detectives and several FBI agents,” Cardillo, also a former New York Police Department (NYPD) officer, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.

Chicago does have a higher number of murders each year than New York City, but not as high as Cardillo claimed. There were 292 murders (including non-negligent manslaughter) in New York City in 2017, while Chicago had 2.2 times as many that year at 653, according to figures from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The FBI gathers police data and reports only crimes known to police.

The Sun-Times reported a slightly higher number: 664 slain in Chicago in 2017 by New Year’s Eve.

Chicago surpassed New York City in the number of murders known to law enforcement in 2012 with a sharp spike in 2016, according to the FBI UCR system.

The trend continued in 2018. New York City police data show 295 murders, while Chicago police reported 561 homicides that year.

Cardillo correctly said that Chicago has less than half the police force of New York City. The NYPD had 36,378 officers in 2017, while Chicago had an officer force about a third of that size with 12,383 officers, according to the FBI UCR system. When including civilian workers, Chicago had around a quarter the number of total law enforcement employees: 13,566 compared to 52,079.

Chicago, however, had more police officers per capita: about 456 officers per 100,000 residents compared to New York City’s 422 per 100,000 residents in 2017.

Cardillo issued a follow-up tweet Monday correcting his figures following an inquiry from TheDCNF.

Correcting this tweet with updated numbers. In 2018 Chicago saw about 2x the murders of NYC, and the CPD was about 1/3rd the size of NYPD. Roughly 13,500 sworn in CPD, 38,000 sworn in NYPD. This makes #JussieSmollett’s hoax and waste of resources even more egregious. https://t.co/NBIOa7NcB4 — John Cardillo (@johncardillo) February 18, 2019

“In 2018 Chicago saw about 2x the murders of NYC, and the CPD was about 1/3rd the size of NYPD,” Cardillo said. “This makes #JussieSmollett’s hoax and waste of resources even more egregious.”

While Chicago did have about twice as many murders as New York City, its murder rate, which accounts for population size, is much higher – 24.1 per 100,000 people in 2017, seven times New York City’s rate of 3.4 per 100,000.

The FBI cautions, however, that its reported figures should not be used to rank or evaluate law enforcement agencies by effectiveness due to local differences in economic conditions, population density, demographics, crime reporting practices and other factors.

Williams'],https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Miami-Dade-College-students-ap.jpg,"['campus', 'university', 'students', 'fix', 'written', 'black', 'documents', 'graffiti', 'watchdog', 'crime', '50', 'college', 'hate', 'hoaxes']","The attentive folks at The College Fix, a student-run watchdog group, have pulled together more than 50 hate crime hoaxes perpetrated on U.S. college campuses during the last seven years.

Between 2012 and 2014, The College Fix reported nine such campus hate crime hoaxes, such as that of two black students at Montclair State University who complained of hateful and threatening graffiti on their dorm room doors targeting blacks and women.

One of the messages read, “Black Bitch you will die.” During their investigation, however, police discovered that the students had written the graffiti themselves.

The College Fix reported another 11 hate crime hoaxes in 2015, including the story of a female Muslim student who claimed she was “stalked and threatened by a guy with a gun.” It turned out that she had fabricated the entire incident.

Three “nooses” discovered hanging near the hall where Black Lives Matter had held a meeting at the University of Delaware turned out not to be nooses, but “remnants of paper lanterns” left over from an event.

In 2016, Elon University students were appalled by graffiti saying, “Bye Bye Latinos Hasta La Vista” after the presidential election. It was learned that a Latino student wrote the note.

In December of that year, a female Muslim Baruch College student complained she had been assaulted on a New York subway by “three drunk white men” who were shouting, “Donald Trump!” Police later arrested the woman herself for having made up the story.

In 2017, a group of liberal students had hung posters with the message “Report Illegal Aliens; America is a White Nation” in an effort to incriminate conservatives.

A black Air Force Academy cadet confessed that year to writing “Go home ni**er” on black students’ dorm room doors, while in Kentucky, a black man filed a false police report about N-word graffiti and a threat painted on his car near Kansas State University. Investigators learned the man himself had written the note.

Similarly, a threat on social media targeting black students at a Maryland high school last March turned out to have actually been written by a black student.

For a rundown of the list of campus hate crime hoaxes, see here.

Unsurprisingly, The College Fix was one of the first groups to unearth inconsistencies in the recent Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax, noting that the case “sounds a lot like college race hoaxes.”

Dispatches: Weekly TV news

“High School Musical” is hoping to find a new generation of fans with the reinvented “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Currently filming in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 10-episode series for The Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service, Disney+, picks up 15 years after the original movie aired. The action follows a group of students as they prepare for the opening night of their school’s first-ever production of “High School Musical.”



Amazon Prime Video has announced that the fourth and final season of Emmy Award-Winning series “The Man in the High Castle” will premiere this fall. The show is currently being filmed in Vancouver.



“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.



Contenders: Shows to keep on your radar

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.



In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.



Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.



Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.



Report Card: A look at ratings winners and losers

Winners: “The Cool Kids” has been a steady performer for Fox, increasing its chances of being renewed next season.



Losers: Maybe it still exists in another version of reality but in this one, the science fiction espionage thriller “Counterpart” is no more. The Starz series has been cancelled.

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted” after detectives released two Nigerian brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police later requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Production sources told tmz.com that Smollet's five scenes have been cut in the second to last episode of the show. Smollet was supposed to have nine scenes but now he will have only four scenes. And there will be no proper focus on Smollet in the remaining scenes. The scenes will feature an ensemble cast.

Due to Smollet's case, the script has also undergone multiple revisions. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Last month, Smollet reported to the police that he was attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and physically assaulted him in Chicago. The actor and singer was reportedly in Chicago for a scheduled Saturday concert.

The attackers had poured ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him, and then wrapped a rope around the actor's neck, according to police.

Following an investigation, two brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo were arrested by the police who viewed them as ""potential suspects"", but they were released later due to lack of evidence. It was later reported that Smollet had staged the attack.

Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on Empire, celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Senator Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid the two acquaintances to stage the attack, reported Variety.com.

Smollet's case will now be presented before the grand jury.

Godfrey seems flummoxed by the Jussie Smollett situation, but he's pretty sure the ""Empire"" star is lying ... and it's time for him to start an apology tour.

The comedian was outside the Laugh Factory in Hollywood Tuesday night when he gave us his take on the alleged attack, but possible hoax, involving Jussie ... whom he suggests might have a mental problem.

Godfrey tells us he feels duped -- like so many others -- because Jussie's story tapped into racial sensitivities and took advantage of the divisive climate these days. He also points out certain details of the alleged attack he finds shady ... like how Trump supporters don't watch ""Empire.""

According to Godfrey, it's time for Jussie to start saying sorry to everyone he's hurt -- the gay community, the black community ... and the MAGA fans he threw under the bus. Gotta think Kellyanne Conway would agree.

He was originally charged with carrying a concealed firearm but now, after public outcry, he will be charged with a hate crime.

The Ledger reports, he was “charged with three counts of aggravated assault with prejudice and two firearms counts, Miami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a news release. The charges are brought under a state law allowing enhanced hate-crime penalties when a crime is motivated by prejudice.”

On Jan. 22, Civil rights attorney Lee Merritt said in a series of tweets that concealed weapons charges don’t go far enough.

“Sources tell me Dana Scalione and Mark Bartlett are the racist pair in the video. Mark was arrested yesterday but only charged with carrying a concealed weapon. We’re coming for both of them now. There will be accountability. #MarkBarlett was arrested and released for less than $500. He bonded out on a concealed weapons charge. That’s not going to be enough. State Prosecutor @KathyFndzRundle we are going to need some additional charges including hate crime enhancements,” he stated.

Thankfully, the charges were upgraded.

The entire episode on Jan. 21 was caught on a video and showed the teens on bicycles arguing with a woman on the Brickell Avenue Bridge in Miami. In the heated confrontation, the woman in the video claimed one of the boys ran over her foot with his bike.

Bartlett then approached the teens holding a gun in his hand. “F***ing stupid ni**ers,” he’s heard saying on the video.

Dream Defenders Action reportedly posted the video and said the young men were protesting redevelopment of a public housing complex.

Officers caught Bartlett shortly after he drove away from the scene, a police report said. His gun was on his front passenger seat and loaded when they caught up with him.

Bartlett approached the teens with his gun because he saw that his girlfriend was outnumbered, and he feared for her life, he stated to the news outlet. He also denied threatening the teenagers, underscoring that he never pointed the weapon at anyone.

As for him being a racist, Bartlett said that’s just not true.

“The reason why we use that word, the reason why Chinese people use the word, why Japanese people, European people, the reason why everybody uses that word is because Black people use that word,” he said.

Now, that could be a reason why he will serve serious jail time.

It will be recalled that Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser claimed he assaulted her when both were high school students several decades before. There were no witnesses to anything untoward brought forth by Dr. Christine Ford, nor was there any record of anything happening between the two. In a word, there was no corroboration – only Dr. Ford’s accusation based solely upon 35 year-old recollections.

Yet the charges alone almost succeeded in derailing the Supreme Court nomination of an experienced, supremely well-qualified and respected appellate judge. At the time we were dismayed by how far we have gone as a nation from the notion of “innocent until proven guilty.” All of the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee – most with a decidedly leftist bent – gave Kavanaugh a rough time. Senators Kamala Harris and Corey Booker, both now having declared for the presidency in 2020, were particularly intense and argumentative. And the media followed suit.

That pattern has continued. Last month, television personality Jussie Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed he was attacked by two masked men as he walked to his apartment from a restaurant. He alleged they shouted racial and anti-gay slurs at him and that “this is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign mantra “Make America Great Again” and an effort to identify the attack with support for President Trump.

Harris promptly responded to the allegation this way: “This was an attempted modern-day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Similarly, Booker: “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe…. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our anti-lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime – I urge you to pay attention.”

The media followed suit. Robin Roberts, one of the hosts of ABC’s Good Morning America, interviewed Smollett at length, allowing him to go into the details of the incident. Not once did she use the word “alleged.” Indeed, other national media outlets ran with the narrative that Smollett was definitely attacked as he described, and at the hands of supporters of President Trump.

Of course, it is now being reported that the whole incident is a hoax and never occurred. While the reasons for the new conclusion seems compelling – there are said to be serious inconsistencies in Smollett’s full account – we will have to await the final outcome. But our point is, it is now rather easy to get people thinking a certain way without having to provide any evidence, turning the presumption of evidence on its head.

In their effort to delegitimize Trump, some people seem to be willing to accept pretty much anything as true. This is not to say that Trump has never made some questionable assertions. But the presumption of innocence is vital to our system of government."

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police last month that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago late last month. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

Chicago’s top prosecutor recused herself from the investigation into the attack reported by Empire actor Jussie Smollett shortly after police requested another interview with the actor.

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted” after detectives released two Nigerian brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police later requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Let us get to the bottom of it, and let justice be done.” This would be the same Al Sharpton who spearheaded the Tawana Brawley gang-rape hoax — a fraud that he never faced “accountability” for, but one that rocketed him to political prominence even as it destroyed the lives of the accused. That hoax also became a template for America’s race-bait political hustlers.

TV show “Empire” star Smollett received wall-to-wall Leftmedia coverage after claiming he was attacked by two MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters. Smollett, who is black and homosexual, claims two white men beat him, tied a noose around his neck, and threw bleach in his face while shouting, “This is MAGA country, nigger!” and calling him “Empire faggot!”

The MSM and Democrat notables immediately pounced on the story, without consideration of how unlikely it was that two Trump supporters would roam the streets of Chicago at 2:00 a.m. in sub-freezing weather, with a bottle of bleach and a noose, on the off chance that a random black actor would decide to go out in the middle of the night for a sandwich.

It now appears Smollett orchestrated the attack himself, paying two Nigerian brothers to play the role of his attackers, even scouting the area and rehearsing beforehand. Not only that, but he did so because he was supposedly upset that a racist letter he received didn’t yield more media attention — and the FBI is now investigating whether Smollett even sent the letter to himself. Smollett was not the victim of a hate crime, he perpetrated one.

Now that the hoax has been exposed, prominent Democrats like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who initially mugged for cameras while decrying America’s teeming racism, calling the attack a “modern-day lynching,” are notably silent.

Much like the Covington Catholic School boys story (where white teenaged boys supposedly threatened an elderly Native American man while wearing MAGA hats), this story had the perfect combination of elements to advance the narrative of virulent racism and homophobia in Trump’s America.

Now the boys are suing The Washington Post for libel and seeking $250 million in damages.

A reasonable person might ask why the media immediately validates any story that demonizes President Donald Trump or his supporters, while simultaneously warning us not to rush to judgment when the black, Democrat Lt. Governor of Virginia faces multiple credible accusations of rape. They certainly didn’t extend the same courtesy to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was accused of sexual assault by a woman who could not provide even the tiniest shred of evidence for her claim.

In a moment of unusual honesty, “The View’s” Joy Behar revealed the truth when, in response to Whoopi Goldberg asking why progressive Democrats keep falling for the hoaxes, she said, “Because we’re desperate to get Trump out of office.”

Wilfred Reilly, political science professor at Kentucky State University, is the author of Hate Crime Hoax — How the Left Is Selling a Fake Race War. “Virtually all of the high profile widely-reported hate crimes over the last two years have been hoaxes,” Reilly notes. “A broader motivation for these hoaxes is that the demand for bigots in America greatly exceeds the supply. … We have a very well-funded grievance industry. … The SPLC currently has an active invested endowment of $432 million dollars.”

Indeed, the sheer number of anti-Trump hoaxes in just two years is staggering. Here are a few of the more notable examples:

A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan claimed a man threatened to set her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. Another Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed two white men, one wearing a Trump hat, beat and robbed her, taking her hijab and wallet while yelling racial slurs. Yet another Muslim woman in New York claimed to have been attacked by a group of Trump supporters while bystanders watched idly. Each later admitted fabricating the stories.

In Indiana, a black church was vandalized with spray-painted swastikas and the words “Heil Trump!” and “fag church.” The Washington Post claimed it was the latest in a string of such incidents since Trump’s Election Day victory. It turns out the church’s organist was the culprit.

In Mississippi, the 110-year-old Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church was burned to the ground. The words “Vote Trump” were found on the remaining brick wall. Initially investigated as a racially motivated hate crime, it turns out that, again, the black church’s own organist was the arsonist.

At the Air Force Academy, St. Olaf Academy (MN), Kansas State University, a Missouri high school, two Texas restaurants, and Drake University, among others, “victims” who claimed they received threatening racist or homophobic notes later recanted their stories; they made up everything.

These are just a few of the hundreds of such hoaxes blamed on white Trump supporters. Michelle Malkin lists even more. In each case the media immediately reported the claims as fact. The later corrections or retractions were buried deep in the newspapers or given just seconds of airtime, if the corrections came at all.

In a bitterly ironic twist, this deluge of hoaxes blamed on Trump supporters has actually incited violence against innocent Trump supporters. The Democrats, the media (but we repeat ourselves), and their social-justice-warrior allies take these hoaxes as absolute fact and feel justified in physically attacking Trump supporters (which of course creates a ratings bonanza for the press on both sides of the ledger).

Journalist Andy Ngo, who did a masterful job of cataloguing many of these hoaxes, perfectly captures the danger of what some have called “outrage porn.” He warns, “Jussie Smollett’s hoax is symptomatic of America’s illness. Because of the mainstreaming of academia’s victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable, or even kind. Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted, treated with child gloves, and believed unreservedly. Their ‘lived experience’ gives them infinite wisdom. Those who urge caution are treated as bigots.”

Decent Americans of every race, sex, religion, political leaning, or any other means by which we divide ourselves must be aware of the very real danger of these incidents turning from brushfires into uncontrollable infernos that lay waste to our nation, escalating into a full-blown civil war. Those who preach tolerance must practice it."

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted”after detectives released two Nigerian brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police later requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

Dispatches: Weekly TV news

“High School Musical” is hoping to find a new generation of fans with the reinvented “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Currently filming in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 10-episode series for The Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service, Disney+, picks up 15 years after the original movie aired. The action follows a group of students as they prepare for the opening night of their school’s first-ever production of “High School Musical.”



Amazon Prime Video has announced that the fourth and final season of Emmy Award-Winning series “The Man in the High Castle” will premiere this fall. The show is currently being filmed in Vancouver.



“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.



Contenders: Shows to keep on your radar

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.



In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.



Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.



Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.



Report Card: A look at ratings winners and losers

Winners: “The Cool Kids” has been a steady performer for Fox, increasing its chances of being renewed next season.



Losers: Maybe it still exists in another version of reality but in this one, the science fiction espionage thriller “Counterpart” is no more. The Starz series has been cancelled.

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers met with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack. ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.""

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program. The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday that she is recusing herself from the investigation.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked whom Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have not further comment.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, reported he was attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago.

He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

Last Wednesday, police picked up two brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday.

Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 22

— Smollett receives a racist and homophobic threatening letter at the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed. Police later say that they believe Smollett sent the letter himself.

Jan. 29

Advertisement

— Jussie Smollett tells police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He says he’s working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” Police question the brothers and search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

Feb. 19

— Chicago police investigate tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

— Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided. Foxx later says the reason for the recusal is that she had conversations with a Smollett family member after the incident was reported in late January.

Feb. 20

— Chicago police say Smollett is officially suspected of filing a false police report when he said he was a victim of a racist, homophobic attack in downtown Chicago late last month. Police also say that two brothers who were questioned about the attack were testifying before a grand jury and detectives were presenting evidence to the grand jury.

— Chicago police say the Cook County State’s Attorney has charged Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report that he was attacked by two masked men. Police detectives were contacting Smollett’s attorneys to arrange his surrender for arrest.

Feb. 21

— Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face a felony charge of disorderly conduct, which could bring up to three years in prison.

— Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted publicity. Investigators say they have a $3,500 check that Smollett used to pay the two brothers to help him.

Feb. 22

— Producers of “Empire” say Jussie Smollett’s character will be removed from the final two episodes of this season.

According to police sources and all kinds of media reports, Jussie Smollett (who is black and gay) did lie about being assaulted by two racist, homophobic Donald Trump supporters in the middle of the night on January 29.

The story was preposterous to begin with. In order to believe it, one was forced to buy into the idea MAGA hat-wearing bigots were running around downtown Chicago in subzero weather carrying bleach and wielding a noose in the hopes of running into an openly gay black man like Smollett.

“This is MAGA country!” the face-masked yahoos reportedly yelled as they poured bleach on Smollett’s black skin and tied a noose around his neck. Bruised, humiliated, and still carrying his cell phone and Subway sandwich, Smollett somehow survived.

Nevertheless, due to their own prejudices and bigotry, a number of terrible people in politics, media, and Hollywood chose to believe Smollett’s story; and they ran with it, and now they look ridiculous (including a handful of Democrat presidential candidates) and are being forced to clean up their own appalling role in advancing Smollett’s hate crime.

On top of all this, it appears as though Smollett might have mailed that infamous hate letter (filled with powder that turned out to be harmless) to himself, or he at least had some role in arranging it.

What we do know is that Smollett’s co-conspirators have rolled on him. The two brothers (both black) he hired to stage the attack are singing like Sinatra, and that includes the news of the phony hate mail.

And so there will be a reckoning, experts say, a legal and reputational one that could result in Smollett being tossed in the clink for a few years, followed by his banishment into a career wilderness from which he will never return.

“It’s a very high-profile case,” a former prosecutor told Variety. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

Defense attorney Steve Greenberg believes Smollett could also face obstruction of justice charges, but it’s unlikely he will go to prison.

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this. People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor,” he said.

On the career front, things could be even more unforgiving; we are talking a Lance Armstrong-style expulsion from the rarified world of celebrity.

“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” a PR expert told Variety. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”

Another PR exec told Variety that if Smollett lied his only hope is to fess up immediately and throw himself at the mercy of the legal system and the court of public opinion.

“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.”

On top of everything else, if Smollett is convicted of anything involving the filing of a false police report, he may also have to reimburse the taxpayers the cost of the investigation, which could be a sizable amount of money considering the manpower the police dedicated to the high-profile case.

CBS reports that a grand jury is already deliberating, which could very well mean Smollett is indicted.

As of now, though, Smollett is sticking to his story, which seems to be that the two brothers are lying about being hired by Smollett, which can only mean that, for whatever reason, they disguised themselves as Trump supporters and waited outside his condo all night in subzero weather looking for the opportunity to beat on him.

Smollett has hired two high-powered defense attorneys, but already his career is showing signs of hoax-related stress. His role in Empire has been slashed, including an episode that was supposed to revolve around his character that would have included a showy musical number.

The Lance Armstrong comparison is probably as close as you can come to the Smollett Hoax, but it is still lacking. Armstrong was a liar, a cheat, and a ruthless bully, but the damage he did, which should not be dismissed, was confined to his orbit. Smollett is something altogether different.

Had Smollett pulled off his hoax, had his ginned up hate crime been caught on video as he likely planned, it could have been the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” media-hoax all over again. That hoax resulted in the burning down of the predominantly black, working class city of Ferguson and countless acts of violence and murder against innocent police officers. Smollett’s hoax could have caused riots, violence against innocent Trump supporters, who knows what else.

Because I have needed more than my share forgiveness and second chances, I always lean in that direction for others. We all need a path to redemption. Time and circumstance might change my mind, but as of now I believe Smollett needs to be made an example of. Yes, he deserves all the due process our system allows, but if found guilty, he should be given no leniency and his show business career should be over forever.

Smollett’s path to redemption should happen in an Appalachia soup kitchen or a Heartland drug rehabilitation center. He is a bigot who sought publicity and moral authority by defaming and smearing a whole group of people. If he wants redemption, that path is through them, not an apology tour on Late-Night TV.

The Jussie Smollett case is starting to get weird. According to NBC5 in Chicago: Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the investigation into the alleged attack into ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats will be the acting state's attorney for the matter, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement Tuesday. No further explanation was given as to why Foxx recused herself. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" the spokesperson said in an email. Maybe that's because she really does know the politically active, politically connected Smollett's friends, for sure. Smollett's mom, Janet Smollett, is reportedly good friends with 1960s radical Angela Davis and Davis has mentored the young Jussie throughout much of his life. Davis, a communist, is a political celebrity on the far left, with an image second only to that of Che Guevara. Academic honors are still being showered on her and leftist luminaries always look to have their picture with hers. Rest assured, she's connected with today's Democrats as one of their radicals manqué. I can't see her not being able to get a phone call through to some of them. It's also quite likely that as the case is increasingly exposed as a hoax (get a load of this detail), prosecuting that act wouldn't make any ambitious prosecutor politically popular. And sure enough, Foxx is ambitious and wants to be popular. Most important, her recusal seems to suggest that Foxx is part of the Chicago Democratic Party political machine, and as a notable hip-hop black film-maker has argued, the hoax itself may well extend to them. It certainly would explain a recusal. Foxx, according to this flattering Chicago Tribune profile, is very much a player in Chicago politics, a favorite rising star among the Democrats. She has only been in office for a little more than a year, but Cook County’s top prosecutor Kim Foxx is already attracting admiring attention from Democrats on the national stage. Foxx on Wednesday night was feted by the party’s Washington, D.C., elite at a gala dinner where she received the Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award from Emily’s List, the major political action committee that works to elect pro-choice women nationwide.

The state’s attorney shared a table with Sen. Cory Booker and met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the event, also attended by Democratic gubernatorial nominee J.B. Pritzker. That’s the kind of clout that would be very helpful in a run for higher office. The Chicago cops investigating the claimed hate attack on Smollett have located two Nigerians affiliated with the cast of the Empire show Smollett had been on, and reportedly learned from them that Smollett paid them to stage the attack. The cops have since dismissed them as suspects and now seem to be focusing on Smollett. Not easy if Smollett's friends are your friends and you're all part of the same leftist 'family.' But the argument of Hollywood hip-hop film maker Tariq Nasheed, who also goes by the names 'K-Flex' and 'King Flex,' is also strengthened by recusal. As I noted here a couple days ago, Nasheed's series of tweets raised suspicions that the hoax had a political nexus, quite likely from Democratic politicians, informed by gay special interests promoting their agenda. He said he was tipped off by the fact that shortly before the attack, there was an 'anti-lynching' law on the table sponsored by Democrats Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom are running for president, and at the last minute, some language specifying homophobia was added to the bill. He was suspicious the whole Smollett attack might have been a staged set-up to get the largely irrelevant law passed with Harris and Booker racking up points with voters. After all, when exactly did the last lynching in the U.S. occur, and aren't there murder laws already on the books? Then the phony attack on gay and black actor Smollett happened, and now it seems to have blown up in their faces, exposed as a hoax. Because the fact that it happened in Chicago and not some stereotypical place like Texas or Mississippi is a red flag. That the Democrats inserted last-minute gay language in their lynch law bill is a red flag. That Harris called the whole thing a lynching to match her pre-made bill is a red flag. Now a Chicago official recuses herself? It really looks like this thing doesn't end with the Nigerians. Harris's weird deer-in-the-headlights response to questions about her own tweet declaring Smollett a victim of a modern-day ""lynching"" only adds more fat to the fire of Nasheed's theory. Foxx's weird recusal points raises even more questions about Democratic involvement in the hoax, because the narrative that had been promoted was to smear President Trump's supporters. Who exactly are Foxx's friends, and which ones match Smollett's friends? Why does this person have so many of them in common with Smollett to the point that she dare not prosecute the case? Smollett himself isn't exactly a Chicago guy, so it's obvious these friends in common aren't ""guy(s) in the neighborhood,"" as President Obama used to put it, trying to explain his ties to another rabid 1960s Chicago-based radical, Bill Ayers. Davis isn't, either. There obviously are some unseen new Ayerses involved and they likely aren't just confined to Angela Davis. With Kamala Harris trying to giggle it away and a Democratic local prosecutor heading for the hills, you can bet the hoax is going to extend. Chicago machine at work here? Obviously this looks like a story that would yield any reporter interested in digging deeper some significant pay dirt.

Amazon Prime Video has announced that the fourth and final season of Emmy Award-Winning series “The Man in the High Castle” will premiere this fall. The show is currently being filmed in Vancouver.



“Empire” star Jussie Smollett could be facing serious charges if he falsified a police report concerning his claim that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who allegedly used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s account is now being challenged as Chicago police investigate whether or not he paid two acquaintances to stage the beating.

“The Oscars” (Feb. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ABC) turns 91 this year with the annual Academy Awards broadcast. It will be the first time in 30 years that the show will not have a host but not to worry, there is no shortage of star presenters.



In “The Green Book: Guide to Freedom,” Smithsonian Channel is taking a closer look into the real story of The Negro Motorist Green Book (Feb. 25, 8 p.m. ET/PT). On the heels of the Golden Globe winning film “Green Book,” the documentary tells the story of Victor H. Green’s eponymously-named travel guide that gave African Americans a way to safely tour the country during a time of institutionalized racism. Featuring a wide array of experts, including historians, business owners and people who experienced the phenomenon of “traveling while black” in pre-civil rights America, the film explores the realities African Americans faced on the road.



Sounding a bit like “The Blacklist,” NBC’s new series “The Enemy Within” (Feb. 25, 10 p.m. ET/PT.) stars Jennifer Carpenter (“Dexter”) as disgraced CIA operative Erica Shepherd. Serving a life sentence in a Supermax prison, Shepherd is a notorious traitor who FBI agent Will Keaton (Morris Chestnut) enlists to help find an elusive criminal she has dealt with in the past.



Scott Foley (“Scandal”) brings the charm to “Whiskey Cavalier,” (Feb. 27, 10 p.m. ET/PT, ABC) as FBI agent Will Chase who reluctantly partners with CIA agent Francesca “Frankie” Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan, “The Walking Dead”) in an interagency black-ops taskforce formed to track down global criminals. It’s a fun show that blends love/hate romantic comedy tropes with fast-paced action.

Is it any wonder that American news consumers are at the end of their ropes of patience with the ""mainstream media""?

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett's absurd hate crime claims, few in the ""professional"" journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone's a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone's making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I'm especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I've chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

—Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" claiming she found a ""degrading"" noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried ""systematic racism,"" and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn't add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism — until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted ""conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner."" Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a ""racist display"" of three ""noose-like objects"" hanging from trees. The UD president called it ""deplorable;"" protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the ""nooses"" were metal ""remnants of paper lanterns"" hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

—Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school's library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

—Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the ""noose"" was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who ""may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.""

—Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. ""A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,"" the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the ""noose"" was a ""packaged leather shoelace"" that someone had dropped accidentally.

—Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of ""nooses"" lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the ""latest in a string of hate incidents"" after Trump's election. The African-American museum director called them a ""reminder of America's dark history."" But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

—Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and ""hate signs"" found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett's folly, media sensationalists bluster that there's no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn't take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you've seen one social justice huckster, you've seen 'em all.

In a new “Between the Scenes” clip from The Daily Show, the comedian meditated on the increasingly messy case and all its confusing details. But while Noah agreed that several aspects of Smollett’s assault don’t add up, he also said that he’s not rushing to accuse the Empire actor of lying about being the victim of a hate crime.

“I don’t know what the details of the Jussie Smollett story are going to end up being,” Noah said. “What I do know is right now, the story just doesn’t make sense in the pieces that it’s laid out as. I’m not saying that he is lying; I’m just saying that his story doesn’t seem to line up with what’s happening.”

In late January, Smollett, a star of Empire, was hospitalized following an attack by two men. Initially, police said they were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Now, anonymous sources have told various news outlets that authorities believe Smollett hired the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested as potential suspects, working with them to stage the attack. Smollett has denied doing any such thing.

“Why are two Nigerian guys walking around in Chicago’s freezing weather and then shouting, ‘This is MAGA country!’?” Noah wondered aloud in the clip. “It’s a weird thing to shout as a Nigerian person.”

Still, the comedian admitted he has no idea what will happen next in this case. One thing he does feel sure of? “If I was Trump, this is a home run in my world. Because so many people jumped on board before they even waited to see what it was about. We live in a world where people are too enthusiastic [to jump] at stories that confirm their biases instead of just pausing and going, ‘What do I make of the story?’”

Indeed, right-wing media has already pounced on the way the story was initially covered. But as Noah pointed out, the phenomenon he described also extends to both sides of the aisle, as the political right comes rife with its own biases and conspiracy theories. When news stories appear to confirm our personal biases, Noah said, “That’s when I always think you have to be even more vigilant.”

“I think increasingly since Trump has come into power, people have become increasingly willing to accept any story that confirms anything about a Trump supporter, or Trump, or a white person,” Noah said. “And I always go like, ‘Do not become the thing that you disdain. Do not become the thing that you hate.’ Because then, what are you fighting for?”

On a lighter note, the comedian also had to admit something else: that this whole ordeal “does sound like an Empire plotline.”

The left would expect mere mortals to understand that as opposed to them, the left rises above the rumormongering and misinformation of social media. As with so much else regarding the left, that’s nonsense. It cuts, pastes and amplifies the unsubstantiated ardor of liberal Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at will — if it advances the narrative. See the case of Jussie Smollett, actor/singer in the Fox hip-hop drama “Empire.”

Smollett’s “MAGA country” hate-crime hoax is just the latest example. Coming on the heels of the smears of Covington Catholic High School MAGA hat-wearing teens, we must conclude the left is too blind, or too stupid, or maybe just doesn’t give a hoot. Nothing says “viral” like a black gay celebrity claiming he was beaten by Trumpster thugs. For two weeks, the left went nuts. Celebrities took to the celebrity talk shows, politicians to the political talk shows and the “news” media to the “news” media to denounce racist conservative Trump World. Now the actor’s “modern-day lynching” narrative, as Sen. Cory Booker declared it, has imploded. As we’ve come to expect, the arrogant defenders of the “high-quality news organizations” are once again refusing to take responsibility for the gasoline they tossed on the fire.

See “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter of the so-called “Facts First” network. He claimed, “Ultimately, this is not about the media, or about politicians or activists, or any other people that might have been fooled. It’s about Jussie.”

Translation: It’s all about the fooler … not the fools.

Later, in his email newsletter, Stelter asked: “Was it newsworthy when the police opened an investigation into Smollett’s accusation? Yes. Did high-quality news organizations approach the case with caution? Yes.”

This is pure nonsense, and Stelter knows it. The national media jumped into the allegations like children jump into a mud puddle. Only ABC, CBS and NBC have devoted 157 morning and evening minutes to the Smollett fraud. Some of these stories call the fraud “alleged.” Some didn’t even bother.

Compare. Two years ago in that same city, there was another attack. Four black thugs bound and gagged an innocent, defenseless 18-year-old mentally disabled white man. He was beaten, kicked, made to drink from a toilet bowl and bloodied from cuts to his scalp. The suspects laughed at him and shouted, “F— Trump” and “F— white people.” The entire attack was captured on video — and streamed live on Facebook. They were arrested; he went into the emergency room. “If it bleeds, it leads”? Not on your life, not something like this. The networks gave the story and all its gore a whopping 27 seconds that night.

Smollett’s story collapsed shortly after ABC’s Robin Roberts gave him an embarrassingly supportive interview. Call the show “Good Fawning America.” Roberts did not approach with “caution.” She chose not to use the word “alleged.” It was true because he said so, and she wanted to believe him because she believes this is what Trump supporters do. She asked, “What do you feel people need to hear the most from this story?” Smollett said, “Just the truth.” Her most ridiculous question was this: “If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?”

Oh, he knew the attackers. Very well.

Kudos to Michelle Malkin, who called out the media early for not asking these obvious questions:

How many racist homophobes wander around an upscale neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach and yelling about “MAGA country”?

How many racist homophobes have heard of “Empire” and could recognize Jussie Smollett from his gay character on the show?

Red flags were visible everywhere, including the fact that the Chicago police told Malkin they initially hadn’t heard the “MAGA country” claims. Early claims that Smollett had broken ribs were false.

President Trump, no doubt advised not to mutter “fake news” about the story, called the story “horrible.” But in the end, it underlined why so many conservatives feel the “news” business isn’t defined by the maxim “Facts First.” It’s “Fakes First.”

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx offered few specifics Tuesday when announcing that Foxx was recusing herself from the case, which police said had “shifted” after detectives released two Nigerian brothers who were initially deemed suspects.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said Foxx spokeswoman Tandra Simonton, who wouldn’t specify how Foxx was familiar with anyone in the case. Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett has said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him before beating him up early on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the men then looped a rope around his neck.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said last week that media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives. But on Saturday, police said the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police later requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Smollett told police he was attacked while getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack.

Investigators did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question. And last week, police picked up the two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

The reduced workload means Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox hip-hop soap, won’t have to be on set as much as new details in his reported Chicago assault continue to emerge. Scenes that Smollett had already shot will not be edited out of episodes that have wrapped production, however.

This latest development follows CNN’s report earlier this week that Chicago police now believe Smollett might have paid two brothers to stage an attack on him that he reported last month.

According to TMZ, which first reported the news of changes to Jamal’s remaining arc this year, Smollett had nine scenes and a “big musical number” in this season’s second-to-last episode. Five of those scenes have now been cut, along with the musical number. And for those other four scenes that remain, they have been rewritten to focus more on an ensemble than just Smollett.

“Multiple revisions” have been made to the episode’s script in just the last 24 hours, per TMZ.

“Empire” returns from its winter hiatus on March 13. Production started up again on Tuesday in Chicago.

Representatives for Fox and studio 20th Century Fox declined TheWrap’s request for comment on TMZ’s report. Representatives for “Empire” co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, as well as showrunner Brett Mahoney, did not return our request for comment, and neither did Smollett’s team.

Police are still investigating the reported attack on Smollett. Two brothers, Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo, were detained and released from custody without charges last Friday after the cops said “new evidence” emerged and the investigation’s “trajectory” changed course.

Authorities said this week they hope to re-question Smollett about the case, but his attorneys said Monday the star had “no plans” to meet with them.

Questions have swirled ever since Smollett said on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA,” which stands for “Make America Great Again” and was Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign slogan."

Although they have made a career out of lying to the America people, just the idea that an actor and pop singer lied — which has not been proven and the Chicago Police Department have had to shut down unfounded claims — is the perfect smokescreen for their nonstop corruption. Kellyanne Conway is the last person to use Smollett to deflect.

While talking about former FBI director Andrew McCabe, who recently said Trump is possibly a Russian asset, Conway randomly brought up Smollett, “I’ll tell you, whether it’s Jussie Smollett or Andrew McCabe, the media just loves to imbue credibility onto people if they bear anti-Trump gifts.” Watch the foolishness below:

This from the person who made up “alternative facts” and the “Bowling Green massacre.”

On Feb. 9, while walking to a subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

On Jan. 22, threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

There have been rumors that the attack was a hoax and he worked with two Nigerian men to set up the assault. However, the 36-year-old actor and singer made it clear to Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” that he was not lying, despite mixed reporting from the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department and online rumors, saying, “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video.

As of now, the police want to speak to Jussie. Media Pros 24/7, a firm representing the actor, said as of yesterday, “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

For many who were skeptical, your reservations are being validated left and right. For those who believed him, well, there’s no getting around this: you were wrong and you got suckered. The alleged hate crime against actor Jussie Smollett, who stars on the Fox show “Empire,” sparked another national outcry. Two white men punched him, poured bleach on him, and tied a rope around his neck. They wore red hats and told him, “this is MAGA country,” while hurling racist and homophobic slurs; Smollett is black and gay. Oh yes, blame President Trump. Blame his supporters. America is a racist trashcan, right? No doubt we have issues, but it’s not nearly as pervasive or systemic as the liberal media would have you believe. Case in point, this Smollett non-assault that appears to be a total hoax. And this isn’t the first time that such so-called racist incidents have been exposed as total hoaxes. It’s a lengthy history. And yes, I’m rejoicing over this. Excuse me for popping champagne over the fact that a hate crime didn’t happen. And yes, overjoyed that the liberal media got egg on their face once again with their astonishing ability to jump the gun and get everything totally wrong.

The two white men were actually Nigerian brothers who knew Smollett. One was an extra on “Empire.” The other was the actor’s former personal trainer. They bought the rope used in the attack, were reportedly paid by Smollett to execute this faux hate crime, and even held rehearsals. The two are cooperating with the police. The attack itself is similar to the plot of a playSmollett had auditioned for. It stinks to high heaven. And now, we’re hearing that this likely hoax was perpetrated because a racist letter sent to Smollett was not given enough media attention. Yep, some letter with a white powder, later determined to be aspirin, was sent to Smollett days before this non-hate crime was committed. With these new developments, Chicago Police no longer consider Smollett a victim. They want a new interview with him as well. To put a cherry on top of this, Smollett was involved in writing the racist letter sent to him (via CBS Chicago):

Jussie Smollett Was Involved In Creating Racist Letter, Which Later Led To Attack, Sources.

The two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett attack told police that Smollett was behind creating a racist letter that was sent to the actor on the set of his show, “Empire,” according to two sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. And when that letter did not get a “bigger reaction,” Smollett orchestrated the attack a week later with the two men–Ola and Abel Osundairo, sources said. Also Tuesday, sources said the two brothers were seen on a ride share video camera before being dropped off near the location of the attack. Smollett received a letter containing a white powder Jan. 22. The letter was mailed to Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where the show “Empire” is filmed. The letter prompted a HAZMAT response. CPD says the “white substance” was later determined to be aspirin. The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps. […] Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. […] The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500.

Talk about a slow-moving trainwreck. So, when will Smollett be charged with filing a false police report? Also, what the hell were you thinking man?"

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

Smollett, an actor on “Empire,” pleaded no contest to giving his brother’s name, Jake, to an officer when he was pulled over, and signing a false name on the document where he pledged to appear in court, according to Page Six .

He was charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence, and driving without a license.

Smollett is now suspected of faking a hate crime against himself and paying two people, including one who worked with him on “Empire,” to carry out the attack. The actor, who is gay and black, alleged that the attack was a hate crime.

Smollett, 36, alleged that two men beat, poured bleach on him, and tied a rope around his neck while yelling racist and homophobic slurs. He said they also yelled at him, “This is MAGA country.”

Over the weekend, reports emerged that brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were paid to carry out the attack after a Chicago Police Department spokesman said last week that there was no evidence to back up the claims that Smollett was lying.

—President Barack Obama and Stephen Curry keep it real during ‘My Brother’s Keeper’ event for young men of color—

The woman, who was dining at Mexican restaurant Tampico Mexican Restaurant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, went on a nasty verbal tirade.

On Saturday, the owner Luis Salas was in the middle of talking to his brother-in-law manager Sergio Budar about upcoming restaurant renovations when the woman got offended because they were speaking in Spanish, Yahoo reports.

“I’ve lived in California for 20 years and English is our first language so you need to speak English,” the customer said to Budar. The restaurant’s hostess, Miranda Castillo, got the confrontation on camera.

“Get the f*** out of my country,” the belligerent woman said.

Another man who was with the racist woman and tried to calm her down to no avail.

Budar tried to de-escalate the situation and told her that he’s in fact a U.S. citizen and any problems she has is “in your mind”.

“I don’t have a problem with the way you look, but you’re in America and you need to speak English,” she answered.

So this lady just starts saying this out of nowhere. And she’s at a mexican restaurant…. idk what she was expecting??? pic.twitter.com/7QiZsKAfpk — Miranda?? (@miranndacas) February 16, 2019



Someone who seemed like a friend of the restaurant owners, stepped in and ordered the woman to get out for being racist.

“I am not racist!” she yelled.

Budar trying to calm the woman even told her he would pay for her meal and asked her to leave.

“I got raped by illegal aliens. You can’t speak English and you want me to be nice to you? F******* rapists.”

Off-camera another customer can be heard saying: “White men rape women too. All men do.”

“The woman’s friend was embarrassed,” said Castillo. “He said, ‘I am sorry, I didn’t know this would happen.’”

—Sen. Kamala Harris says she won’t comment on Jussie Smollett investigation until investigation is complete—

The situation was unsettling for Castillo.

“I felt a lot of adrenaline and I’m a very sensitive person, so if I had gotten in the middle of it, I would have started crying,” Castillo told the outlet. “Her levels of anger were insane.”"

Smollett has long displayed a hankering for preacher status. His Twitter stream is replete with counsel about matters of spirit, skepticism, and persistence that sounds a tad self-satisfied from someone in his 30s. His mother associated with the Black Panthers and is friends with the activist Angela Davis, and in interviews Smollett has identified proudly with the activist tradition.

The problem is that amid the complexities of 2019 as opposed to 1969, keeping the Struggle going is more abstract, less dramatic, than it once was. Angela Davis is on T-shirts; it seems less likely that, for example, the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson will be. How do you make as stark and monumental a statement as a King or a Malcolm these days? With a touch too much thirst for glory, and a tad too little inclination for analysis, one might seek to be attacked the way they were.

In John Ford’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, a newspaperman advises, “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” One take on Smollett’s story, if he turns out to have orchestrated it, will be that it was true in essence—a teachable example of the very real phenomenon of hate crimes. For a long time, the enlightened black person was to pretend that O. J. Simpson was framed by the Los Angeles Police Department, out of concern about the way the LAPD actually had treated black people for decades. For similar reasons, even today the idea that Michael Brown in Ferguson died with his hands up, although soundly refuted by all lines of evidence, retains status as almost an “alternative fact” in some quarters.

However, Smollett, in crafting his own “legend”—if that’s what happened—is less channeling Simpson and Brown than Tawana Brawley and Rachel Dolezal.

In 1987, Brawley claimed that six white men had abducted her, raped her, and left her in the woods covered with feces. They had scrawled racial epithets across her torso. That account turned out to be as fictional as it now sounds, but Brawley claimed as late as 1997 that “something happened to me,” a deftly vague statement. However, a key difference between Brawley and Smollett, pointing up the difference between 1987 and 2019, is that while Brawley lied to escape the wrath of her mother’s boyfriend after she ran away from home for four days, Smollett may have lied to look good to the public.

Read: How Americans became so sensitive to harm

Dolezal, white, spent years with a spray tan, “identifying” as black and even heading a local NAACP branch, and had fabricated episodes of racist discrimination against herself. As Bryan Cranston’s dentist character on Seinfeld adopted Judaism for the jokes, Dolezal, one might say, took on blackness for the victimhood. She felt that her existence was more meaningful while she was “playing” an oppressed black person than living as a white person despite all the attendant privileges. Few news events more perfectly illustrated that in our moment, a claim of victimhood from a black person is a form of power. Only in an America much further past the old days than many like to admit could a white person eagerly seek to be a put-upon black person out of a sense that it looked “cool.” A Dolezal would have been unimaginable until roughly the late 1990s."

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Also Wednesday, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor."

Smollett, 36, an actor best known for his role on “Empire,” alleged that he had been attacked on Jan. 29 in downtown Chicago at around 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures by two white men who hurled slurs at him.

Two black men were arrested in mid-February on suspicion of being involved in the attack but were released after reportedly informing detectives that Smollett paid them to stage the attack.

As part of the investigation into what really happened, police confirmed they received a tip from a resident that Smollett and the men, brothers of Nigerian descent, were spotted on the elevator at Smollett’s apartment building on the night of the attack.

LATEST FROM CPD on Jussie Smollett “CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.” — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 19, 2019

In an update, police told CBS that the tip was “unfounded.” Officers came to the conclusion after interviewing the witness and analyzing other evidence.

“CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives,” a police spokesman said.

The dismissal of the case came as the two brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, met with prosecutors on Tuesday, Feb. 19, along with their attorney. Police said they want to interview Smollett again, but he has thus far refused to go to the police or plan an interview date.

A complaint against Smollett from 2007 emerged later on Tuesday showing that the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police, driving under the influence, and driving without a license when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Smollett was sentenced to two years of probation and a choice of a fine or jail time, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office told NBC LA. According to the complaint, Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer.

He also signed a name that was not his own on the promise to appear in court.

According to court records obtained by The Associated Press (AP), Smollett pleaded no contest to giving false information, which was reduced from false impersonation, along with the other two charges.

Records show he completed an alcohol education and treatment program and finished the other terms of the sentence in May 2008.

Also on Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said that she’s recusing herself from the ongoing investigation into the alleged attack.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” a spokeswoman told AP. She declined to answer when asked which people in the case Foxx is familiar with.

According to TMZ and the Chicago Sun-Times, investigators are considering empaneling a grand jury in the case.

A police spokesman told Fox on Monday that it was premature to plan for a grand jury but that if Smollett didn’t voluntarily submit to an interview with police, it could be used to compel him to testify in the case."

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett's attorneys to ""negotiate a reasonable surrender,"" Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

""We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we're hoping he does the same,"" Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett's attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett ""enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.""

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett's account - something police signaled Friday when they announced a ""significant shift in the trajectory"" of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" - before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett ""continues to be a consummate professional on set"" and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio's statement followed reports that Smollett's role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett's potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to ""lock in their testimony.""

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that ""it doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone's guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O'Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett's case, ""I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

Earlier this week, Chicago's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of conversations she had with one of Smollett's family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx ""facilitated a connection"" between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

—Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism — until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The UD president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

ORDER IT NOW

—Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school’s library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

—Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

—Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. “A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,” the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

—Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election. The African-American museum director called them a “reminder of America’s dark history.” But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

—Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot.

Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until it’s completed.

Speaking Monday to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, during her first presidential campaign trip to the state, the U.S. senator from California says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” Police in Chicago say their investigation into the report that the actor was attacked by two men yelling slurs has “shifted” after two brothers were questioned and released. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The Presidents Day holiday weekend brought Harris and other Democratic presidential candidates to New Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020. Also campaigning in the Granite State were Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, campaigned in Iowa as well."

Not only did the Empire actor script his own attack, the two brothers initially arrested in the “attack” Smollett have allegedly told police, he wrote the earlier threatening letter to the show’s producers as well. That may land Smollett a starring role in another production altogether:

The two brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett attack told police that Smollett was behind creating a racist letter that was sent to the actor on the set of his show, “Empire,” according to two sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. And when that letter did not get a “bigger reaction,” Smollett orchestrated the attack a week later with the two men–Ola and Abel Osundairo, sources said. Also Tuesday, sources said the two brothers were seen on a ride share video camera before being dropped off near the location of the attack. … The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps.

As bad as matters have become for Smollett in Chicago, this increases his troubles exponentially. CBS Chicago also reports that the FBI has gotten involved in the investigation, which tends to confirm that investigators at least see this as a significant possibility. A hoax attack itself, if that’s what this was, would have only involved the potential criminal liability of filing a false police report and potential civil action to recoup the cost of the investigation. Sending that letter through the US mail was a federal crime no matter who did it. If Smollett sent it, he could get five years in prison for such a stunt under 18 USC 876:

(c) Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication with or without a name or designating mark subscribed thereto, addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. If such a communication is addressed to a United States judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or an official who is covered by section 1114, the individual shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.

But wait — there’s more! Since the letter contained the crushed aspiring as a hoax chemical/biological attack in itself, that violates 18 US Code 1038 – False Information and Hoaxes. That could add another five years to a potential sentence, although it would likely run concurrently rather than consecutively. Smollett’s next gig could be Club Fed, and for more than a season.

This seems like odd timing, too:

BREAKING: Cook County S.A. Kim Foxx has recused herself from investigation surrounding the Jussie Smollett case. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/CKghZRnmEq — Brad Edwards (@tvbrad) February 19, 2019

Why? Her office released a statement last night:

Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.

That may not mean much if the FBI links the letter back to Smollett. The state won’t be the big stage for an eventual trial under those circumstances. But it’s certainly curious."

Abel and Ola Osundairo previously were reported to have told the police Smollett paid them to stage an attack against the actor on Jan. 29, which he blamed on supporters of President Donald Trump. The brothers were arrested in mid-February but were released after giving detectives information that “changed the trajectory of the investigation,” according to the Chicago Police Department.

Sources with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CBS Chicago that the brothers told police in a follow-up interview on Tuesday that Smollett was behind creating the letter, which featured letters that appeared to be cut out from magazines to form threats against the actor in addition to a crude drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree.

One of the pieces of evidence taken from the brothers’ house last week was a magazine. Investigators also took a book of stamps from the house.

The letter also contained a white powder and prompted a police response on Jan. 22, the day it was received on the set. The white substance was later determined to be aspirin.

The brothers reportedly told police that Smollett was upset that the letter didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” prompting him to orchestrate the fake hate crime attack in Chicago, which has steadily turned into an investigation of Smollett as evidence mounts of a hoax being perpetrated.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS. Other sources corroborated the information.

The FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating whether Smollett played a role in sending the letter, two federal officials told ABC News. The letter is currently being analyzed in an FBI crime lab.

Under Illinois state law, filing a false police report or complaint can lead to an arrest and possible jail time.

Smollett Maintains Innocence

Smollett has maintained his innocence, denying reports that he was involved in planning the attack.

Over the weekend, Smollett’s lawyers said the actor was angry by the reports.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

On Monday, after Chicago police said they wanted to interview Smollett again in light of the investigation-shifting information that they’d received from the brothers, Smollett’s legal team said in a statement sent to Fox, “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today.”

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf,” the team added. It appears that the team has not issued any further statements, including no response to the reports about the actor being involved in creating and sending the letter.

Statement from #Smollett crisis team: “There are no plans for #JussieSmollett to meet w/ Chicago police 2day. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.

California Arrest

A complaint against Smollett from 2007 also emerged on Tuesday. The actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police, driving under the influence, and driving without a license when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence in California that year.

Smollett was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail time, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office told NBC LA. According to the complaint, Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer.

He also signed a name that was not his own on the promise to appear in court.

According to court records obtained by The Associated Press (AP), Smollett pleaded no contest to giving false information, which was reduced from false impersonation, along with the other two charges.

Records show he completed an alcohol education and treatment program and finished the other terms of the sentence in May 2008."

So, Jussie Smollett was lying.

The “Empire” actor claimed that when he was walking home at 2 a.m. in Chicago, in the midst of the polar vortex, he was accosted by two assailants, both of whom shouted anti-gay and anti-black slurs at him. They then attempted to throw a noose around his neck and pour what he thought was bleach on him while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” he says.

None of this is true. Police now believe that Smollett paid two of his friends to stage the entire attack.

Why, exactly, would Smollett do it? He is a successful actor on a hit television show. He’s been continuously working in Hollywood for years, with roles in the 2017 films “Marshall” and “Alien: Covenant.” He’s not exactly a textbook victim.

The answer to this question makes for some uncomfortable lessons.

First, alleged victims sometimes have an incentive to lie. For several years, each time an alleged victim tells an unverified and unverifiable story, we are told that we must believe that victim’s story. Why? Because why would the victim lie? But this is often untrue. Smollett had an incentive to lie: unending media attention, fawning sycophancy from politicians and the potential for even greater Hollywood stardom. If Smollett had gotten away with his hoax, he’d be the face of gay, black suffering in the United States. Few had heard of Smollett before this story. Suddenly, he found himself on “Good Morning America,” telling the world about his own bravery. That’s a lucrative career path.

Second, hoaxers can read the tea leaves. There’s a reason that the most prominent racial and sexual hoaxes have generally flattered the political sensibilities of the political left. Right-wing hoaxes might catch the attention of right-wing sources, but left-wing sources are far more powerful and plentiful. Imagine if a MAGA-hatted young Republican had accused two young black men of assaulting him while shouting, “F-— Trump!” That story might get play on talk radio and Fox News, but it wouldn’t earn one iota of attention from celebrity culture or the mainstream media.

Third, social media makes hoaxes infinitely easier. There are large-scale incentives for jumping on every story before the facts are clear, which is why both Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., both running for president, tweeted their support for Smollett … and then had to backtrack radically, suggesting as the hoax emerged that they had to wait for more facts. Being the first to rip America bears political fruit; waiting for the whole story often earns public castigation for insufficient sensitivity.

All of this means that the hoaxes won’t stop anytime soon. The incentives simply aren’t aligned for hoaxes to end. Media members are too eager to buy into stories that support their preferred narratives; social media is too eager to engage in pile-ons of epic proportions; hoaxes are obviously eager to make a buck or win some fame. Which means that we should all wait next time we hear a story too good to be true.

But we won’t. Nobody knows who the next Jussie Smollett will be. But within a few weeks, we’ll surely know.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

RELATED: Minneapolis Police Chief Can’t Release George Floyd Bodycam + He’s Fighting with Police Union on Reform

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Not long after fake racist charges were leveled against the Catholic Covington high school boys, charges of another hate crime were filed in Chicago. Actor Jussie Smollett, an openly gay, black actor on the Fox series “Empire,” claimed he was attacked after leaving a Subway restaurant on January 29th.

And as surely as night follows day, multiple big media commentators and left-wing politicians rushed to judgment and all jumped to the same conclusion.

They found it totally believable that two white men stalked Smollett, attacked him, threw bleach on him and shouted “This is MAGA country” at 2:00 AM in Chicago when the temperature was minus 9 degrees. There may be two Trump voters in Chicago, but I doubt they know each other.

When asked by “Good Morning America” co-host Robin Roberts why he was singled out for this attack, Smollett answered, “I come really, really hard against [Donald Trump]… and I don’t hold my tongue.""

In the days that followed the alleged attack, surveillance video showed two suspicious looking men. But as the investigation proceeded, there were numerous discrepancies in Smollett’s story, and he was less than forthcoming with the police.

Last week, Smollett’s two ""attackers” were identified. They are not white. They are of Nigerian descent. One of the men had also appeared on “Empire.” They told the Chicago police that they were hired by Smollett to attack him and also sent a fake hate letter to him.

Over the weekend, left-wing pundits and politicians, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, were forced to take down posts that blamed Donald Trump for the attack.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who wants to be president, used Smollett’s allegations to champion legislation making lynching a federal hate crime. Ironically, it seems that the only crime committed here was Smollett’s. Booker is now refusing to comment until “all the information actually comes out.""

That’s good advice, senator. Too bad you didn’t follow it when it mattered most.

While some may be tempted to laugh, this is no laughing matter. At a time of significant racial discord, much of it fueled by the left, Smollett set out to throw gasoline on the fire.

So I join Al Sharpton, who knows a thing or two about hate hoaxes, in calling for justice for Jussie and ""accountability to the maximum.""

The radical left, which is saturated with Trump hatred, is deranged. Sadly, hate hoaxes — extreme forms of left-wing propaganda designed to demonize conservatives — are becoming increasingly common.

Here’s a list of nearly two dozen hate hoaxes perpetrated since Trump’s election.

Trump vs. Socialism

Speaking in Miami, Florida, Monday, President Trump delivered a blistering speech against the tyrannical regime in Venezuela. Trump called on military leaders there to side with the Venezuelan people and President Juan Guaido and to reject Cuban puppet Nicolas Maduro.

Trump also denounced socialism in Venezuela as well as those demanding socialism in the United States. Here are some excerpts of his remarks.

""Not long ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest nation, by far, in South America. But years of socialist rule have brought this once-thriving nation to the brink of ruin. . .

""In other words, the socialists have done in Venezuela all of the same things that socialists, communists, totalitarians have done everywhere that they’ve had a chance to rule. The results have been catastrophic.

""Almost 90 percent of Venezuelans now live in poverty… Crippling shortages of food and medicine plague the country. Socialism has so completely ravaged this great country that even the world’s largest reserves of oil are no longer enough to keep the lights on…

""The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere and, frankly, in many, many places around the world. The days of socialism and communism are numbered not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and in Cuba as well.

""Socialism promises prosperity, but it delivers poverty. Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it delivers division. Socialism promises a better future, but it always returns to the darkest chapters of the past. . .

""Socialism is a sad and discredited ideology rooted in the total ignorance of history and human nature, which is why socialism, eventually, must always give rise to tyranny, which it does. Socialists profess a love of diversity, but they always insist on absolute conformity…

""And to those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country. We are born free and we will stay free, now and forever.”

And speaking of socialists, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders officially declared his candidacy for president in 2020 yesterday.

States Sue For Open Borders

Sixteen states, led by California, filed suit Monday in federal court challenging the constitutionality of President Trump’s national emergency declaration at the southern border.

The states joining the effort are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Virginia.

Believe it or not, the California suit was actually the third legal challenge against the president’s declaration. Two others were filed Friday in Washington, D.C. But everyone, including the president, expected the open borders left would rush to the courts to block Trump’s efforts to secure our border.

This is setting up an interesting dynamic. You may recall that in 2010, the state of Arizona sought to crack down on illegal immigration when the Obama Administration refused to do so. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled against Arizona on the grounds that immigration enforcement was almost exclusively the domain of the federal government.

Now that we finally have an administration willing to enforce our immigration laws, left-wing states are suing to ensure that the borders remain open.

Voters Want Accountability

Last week, I wrote that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe attempted to stage a coup when he conspired with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump. Those are strong words, but I am not the only one who feels that way.

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz agrees. And Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is demanding answers under oath because, as Graham put it, McCabe’s “underlying accusation is beyond stunning.""

It seems many Americans feel the same way.

A new Rasmussen poll finds that 56% of voters believe crimes were likely committed by senior deep state officials, and 51% support the appointment of another special counsel to investigate the FBI and Justice Department."

Is it any wonder that American news consumers are at the end of their ropes of patience with the “mainstream media”?

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

–Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

–Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism — until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

–University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The UD president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

–Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school’s library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

–Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

–Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. “A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,” the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

–Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election. The African-American museum director called them a “reminder of America’s dark history.” But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

–Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn’t take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you’ve seen one social justice huckster, you’ve seen ‘em all.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

The left would expect mere mortals to understand that as opposed to them, the left rises above the rumormongering and misinformation of social media. As with so much else regarding the left, that’s nonsense. It cuts, pastes and amplifies the unsubstantiated ardor of liberal Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at will — if it advances the narrative. See the case of Jussie Smollett, actor/singer in the Fox hip-hop drama “Empire.”

Smollett’s “MAGA country” hate-crime hoax is just the latest example. Coming on the heels of the smears of Covington Catholic High School MAGA hat-wearing teens, we must conclude the left is too blind, or too stupid, or maybe just doesn’t give a hoot. Nothing says “viral” like a black gay celebrity claiming he was beaten by Trumpster thugs. For two weeks, the left went nuts. Celebrities took to the celebrity talk shows, politicians to the political talk shows and the “news” media to the “news” media to denounce racist conservative Trump World. Now the actor’s “modern-day lynching” narrative, as Sen. Cory Booker declared it, has imploded. As we’ve come to expect, the arrogant defenders of the “high-quality news organizations” are once again refusing to take responsibility for the gasoline they tossed on the fire.

See “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter of the so-called “Facts First” network. He claimed, “ultimately, this is not about the media, or about politicians or activists, or any other people that might have been fooled. It’s about Jussie.”

Translation: It’s all about the fooler … not the fools.

Later, in his email newsletter, Stelter asked: “Was it newsworthy when the police opened an investigation into Smollett’s accusation? Yes. Did high-quality news organizations approach the case with caution? Yes.”

This is pure nonsense, and Stelter knows it. The national media jumped into the allegations like children jump into a mud puddle. Only ABC, CBS and NBC have devoted 157 morning and evening minutes to the Smollett fraud. Some of these stories call the fraud “alleged.” Some didn’t even bother.

Compare. Two years ago in that same city, there was another attack. Four black thugs bound and gagged an innocent, defenseless 18-year-old mentally disabled white man. He was beaten, kicked, made to drink from a toilet bowl and bloodied from cuts to his scalp. The suspects laughed at him and shouted, “F-— Trump” and “F-— white people.” The entire attack was captured on video — and streamed live on Facebook. They were arrested; he went into the emergency room. “If it bleeds, it leads”? Not on your life, not something like this. The networks gave the story and all its gore a whopping 27 seconds that night.

Smollett’s story collapsed shortly after ABC’s Robin Roberts gave him an embarrassingly supportive interview. Call the show “Good Fawning America.” Roberts did not approach with “caution.” She chose not to use the word “alleged.” It was true because he said so, and she wanted to believe him because she believes this is what Trump supporters do. She asked, “What do feel people need to hear the most from this story?” Smollett said, “just the truth.” Her most ridiculous question was this: “If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?”

Oh, he knew the attackers. Very well.

Kudos to Michelle Malkin, who called out the media early for not asking these obvious questions:

How many racist homophobes wander around an upscale neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach and yelling about “MAGA country”?

How many racist homophobes have heard of “Empire” and could recognize Jussie Smollett from his gay character on the show?

Red flags were visible everywhere, including the fact that the Chicago police told Malkin they initially hadn’t heard the “MAGA country” claims. Early claims that Smollett had broken ribs were false.

President Trump, no doubt advised not to mutter “fake news” about the story, called the story “horrible.” But in the end, it underlined why so many conservatives feel the “news” business isn’t defined by the maxim “Facts First.” It’s “Fakes First.”

Sanders announced his second campaign this morning in a ten-minute video. Before you drop everything and watch it, take half a moment to appreciate just how much America and the Democratic Party have changed over the past four years.

Pull up Sanders' first presidential announcement speech. It was May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Vermont. Sanders looked a lot different then, but the second thing you will notice, if you watch it is how familiar his words sound. It is spooky.

Virtually, all of the themes in Sanders' announcement speech, his first one, or what in the end got Donald Trump elected president -- the collapse of the middle class, the crushing cost of health care and student loans, the pointlessness of perpetual war in the Middle East, the distorting effects of the Washington lobbyists and donors - the swamp, the dangers of corporate power and the need for better jobs and higher wages for Americans, the generational disaster that is the trade policy -- it is all there, everything but build a wall.

Sanders has often described the 1970s era as socialist and that is basically true. He honeymooned in the Soviet Union. He looks like he combs his hair with a balloon, but if you listen carefully, what Bernie Sanders was really selling in the last campaign was not Marxism, it was economic populism and an awful lot of people agreed with it.

Many of them wound up voting for Donald Trump in the general election. In case you have forgotten, here is what Bernie Sanders said back then:

I am fighting to break up the large banks on Wall Street. (Cheering and applause) But I do want the opportunity to tell them face-to-face what their greed and illegal behavior has done to this country. (Cheering and applause) If Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FULL EPISODE

Well, you can disagree about whether Wall Street and the big banks are really driving America's decline, like all politicians -- Sanders was and is an over-stayer -- but looking back, there was something touchingly old fashioned about the way Bernie Sanders ran that campaign.

Sanders made no appeal at all to interest groups. He explicitly opposed interest groups. He instead talked about national unity and the people left behind. His first announcement speech did not mention the words ""racism"" or ""sexism"" or for that matter, ""abortion"" or ""gun control."" He said nothing about immigration or noncitizens.

Sanders was running for Americans -- all of them -- whether you would agree with him or not.

Needless to say, Sanders quickly found himself at war with Democrats. The modern Democratic Party has no place for the idea of nationhood. It rejects the existence of universal interests and values. Instead of a common American culture, Democrats see only tribes.

Now, Bernie Sanders is pushing 80 and he seems completely bewildered by these changes in attitude.

In the weeks after 2016 election, Sanders told one reporter that Hillary Clinton lost the race because ""It's not good enough to say, 'I am a woman, vote for me.'"" Well, Sanders was right,obviously. But he was way too late.

Modern Democrats are defined by identity politics, that's the idea that the accident of your birth determines what your worth, your value. Some groups are favored, others are blamed and punished. What matters isn't what you do, the choices that you make. What matters is who you are genetically. By the time Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court six months ago, the Democrats had made this entirely explicit. Here are a few examples:

JOHN GARAMENDI, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Women across this nation should be outraged at what these white men senators are doing to this woman.

ELIE MYSTAL, HOST, LEGAL TALK NETWORK: This is all gross strategizing from 11 old white men.

A. SCOTT BOLDEN, ATTORNEY: It is a white man strategy that is politically dumb, in my opinion.

JOY BEHAR, HOST, THE VIEW: These people in Congress right now in the Senate Judiciary Committee, these white man, old, by the way, are not protecting women.

Old, white men. Not a favored group in the modern Democratic Party to put it mildly, and yet Bernie Sanders is undeniably all three of those things. So how do you win the nomination of a party that hates you for qualities that you can't change?

Bernie Sanders is not the only Democrat facing this dilemma, far from it, nor is he the only one to realize that there is only one solution, you have to embrace identity politics. Getting woke is the only option, so Bernie Sanders has done just that. Here is this excerpts from his second presidential announcement video which was released on Tuesday:

“Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and all forms of discrimination.”

So that is the new Bernie Sanders, and he seems a lot smaller than the old version. Instead of saving America from predatory global capitalism, Sanders plans to save us from Donald Trump's racism and sexism.

OK, let's say he does that. What then? Racism and sexism aren't actually the biggest problems that America faces, sorry, not even close, actually. Growing economic stratification and a dying middle class, those are the biggest problems, but nobody in Washington wants to talk about those things and why would they? People in Washington are richer than ever.

Any change of the status quo is a threat to them by definition. It is much better for them to have the population squabble over unresolvable questions of identity. A nation that is arguing about skin color is not asking how a tiny group of people is now flying private while almost everybody else has gotten poorer.

So identity politics is a tactic designed to prevent conversations dangerous to the ruling class, obviously. It is also a way for some of the most privileged people in America to recast themselves as victims.

Cory Booker, for example, Cory Booker went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale. His parents were IBM executives. Booker has spent most of his career in the Senate carrying water for his fellow privileged people, his peers on Wall Street.

Privileged? Yes, Cory Booker defines that word. Now that he's running for president, it will be interesting to hear Cory Booker explain why he has allowed his friends in the finance world to continue to pay half the tax rate that you are probably paying now, but he likely doesn't want to talk about that.

Instead, he will probably spend most of his time talking about racism, including the racism he has personally experienced as a powerless person. -- A powerless person who went to Stanford, Oxford, and Yale and whose parents were IBM executives.

So you can see what is going on here. This is a scam. Identity politics is a scam and it is not so different from the one that Jussie Smollett just pulled.

Smollett a rich actor with a hit TV show. That is fine. We used to call people like that ""pampered,"" but Smollett doesn't want to be thought of as pampered -- and nobody does really -- so here he recast himself as a victim.

The people oppressing him, he told us, were Trump voters. Badly educated thugs from some rural backwater probably, in-breeds who have never read a book. People who do not have Kamala Harris' personal cellphone number. People who probably don't even believe in global warming or like Thai food. Those people. They are the problem and they must be crushed.

Somehow, the left is telling us the weak are now oppressing the strong. That is their claim. The old left would have pushed back against this. They would have felt some sympathy for the people our economy has left behind, but not anymore. The new left reveres Cory Booker and Barack Obama. They are rallying behind Jussie Smollett. Once Smollett's fraud was exposed, they defended him without saying so.

Here’s what Cory Booker said, “Well, the information is still coming out and I am going to withhold until all of the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

And Kamala Harris, “OK, so I will say this about that case. I think that the facts are still unfolding, and once the investigation is concluded, then we can all comment, but I'm not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

So no one can admit that Jussie Smollett is not a victim. He is a rich guy who played the victim and blamed other people. Now, nobody has asked Bernie Sanders about that story. But he would probably say the same thing. He has to say that, it is required now."

We’re told the call has gone out to his lawyers, but cops have not heard back. It’s now complicated by the fact there are rumblings Jussie has a new lawyer — Mark Geragos.

Our sources say cops are waiting to see if Geragos makes contact with them. Our sources say if Jussie refuses to speak with police — which is almost a certainty — the case will go directly to the grand jury.

Even if Jussie speaks to police, unless he pulls a rabbit out of a hat and convinces them the “attack” was real, the case is still going to the grand jury.

CHICAGO - As authorities laid out their case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage a racist, anti-gay attack on himself, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout ""MAGA country"" and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

""I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,"" Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters. ""But unfortunately that particular camera wasn't pointed in that direction.""

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is shot, police said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, turned himself in on charges that he filed a false police report last month when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked men who hurled derogatory remarks and looped a rope around his neck.

The actor ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" police, Johnson said.

""This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve,"" Johnson added.

The attack reverberated well beyond Chicago and swiftly took on political overtones, with liberals calling it a shocking example of Trump-era hate. Republicans seized on the criminal charges as proof that Democrats had rushed to judgment and unfairly disparaged the president's supporters as bigots.

Smollett's legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a ""man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence."" The statement also said Johnson's Thursday afternoon press conference was ""an organized law enforcement spectacle.""

(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green, File)

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,"" the statement read.

Prosecutors released a four-page document that outlined their case against Smollett, who plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

For the alleged hoax, Smollett solicited the help of two muscular brothers. One of them was Abindola ""Abel"" Osundairo, a friend he worked out with and who worked on the show as a stand-in for another character. He also supplied Smollett with the drug ecstasy, prosecutors said.

""He probably knew he needed somebody with bulk,"" Johnson said of Smollett's decision to hire the pair.

A few days before Osundairo and his brother, Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, were scheduled to fly to Nigeria, Smollett sent him a text that prosecutors said set the scheme in motion.

""Might need your help on the low,"" he wrote his friend, according to the document.

During a meeting with the brothers, Smollett told them he wanted the attack to happen Jan. 28 near his apartment in the city's Streeterville neighbourhood, and that he wanted them to get his attention by calling out slurs, prosecutors said. He is accused of instructing them to put the rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell the MAGA remark, an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's slogan during the 2016 campaign.

Smollett then gave one of the brothers $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps that resemble those worn by Trump supporters, according to prosecutors. He drove them to the spot where he wanted the attack to take place, taking time to show them the camera that he said would capture it.

He drove them home, wrote a check to one of the brothers for $3,500 and flew to New York, prosecutors said.

The time of the ""attack"" was pushed back to 2 a.m. Jan 29 because Smollett's return flight was delayed. The brothers ordered an Uber ride to pick them up at their apartment and climbed into the vehicle toting their supplies, including bleach because there was a decision to use that instead of gasoline, according to prosecutors' summary.

Police know much of this, they said, because Chicago has one of the world's most extensive video surveillance systems. Investigators, in effect, pieced together the route the two men took by cab and foot to and from the scene, Johnson said.

The encounter lasted about 45 seconds. The brothers, Johnson said, ""punched him a little bit,"" but the scratches and bruises that Smollett had on his face were ""most likely self-inflicted.""

When police arrived, he told them what happened and pointed out the nearby surveillance camera, prosecutors said at the court hearing.

Smollett also tried to mislead police about the suspects, telling them that the area around one attacker's eyes was white skinned, even though the brothers are black, prosecutors said.

Johnson said Smollett used the one of the most terrifying symbols of racial hatred — a noose — that is synonymous with lynchings.

""I'm offended by what happened and I'm also angry,"" he said.

By the time Smollett appeared on ""Good Morning America"" on Feb. 14, police already had a pretty good idea that he was lying, thanks to dozens of search warrants, subpoenas and extensive analysis of camera and phone records. They also knew the names of the brothers, and the fact that they had flown to Nigeria and were scheduled to return to Chicago on Feb. 13.

The men were arrested and questioned for hours. At hour 47 — one hour before police had to either charge the men or release them — Johnson said the two confessed to what they had done. They were subsequently released without being charged.

Prosecutors charged Smollett late Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct — the charge that is used for filing a false police report. He turned himself in to police Thursday and was jailed until an afternoon court appearance.

Smollett's attorneys asked that the actor be freed on his own recognizance, but Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. rejected that idea. Lyke, who is also black, said he was bothered by the allegations involving the noose.

""The most vile and despicable part of it, if it's true, is the noose,"" he said. ""That symbol conjures up such evil in this country's history.""

The judge set Smollett's bond at $100,000, and the actor soon walked out of jail after posting the necessary $10,000. He declined to comment to reporters.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor's salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on ""Empire"" received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama's renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

The companies that make ""Empire,"" Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, issued a statement Thursday saying that they were ""evaluating the situation"" and ""considering our options.""

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media. Referring to a published account of the attack, Trump said last month that ""it doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

On Thursday, he tweeted to Smollett: ""What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA.""

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had ”shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

CHICAGO - As authorities laid out their case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage a racist, anti-gay attack on himself, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout ""MAGA country"" and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

""I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,"" Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters. ""But unfortunately that particular camera wasn't pointed in that direction.""

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is shot, police said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, turned himself in on charges that he filed a false police report last month when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked men who hurled derogatory remarks and looped a rope around his neck.

The actor ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,"" police, Johnson said.

""This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve,"" Johnson added.

The attack reverberated well beyond Chicago and swiftly took on political overtones, with liberals calling it a shocking example of Trump-era hate. Republicans seized on the criminal charges as proof that Democrats had rushed to judgment and unfairly disparaged the president's supporters as bigots.

Smollett's legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a ""man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence."" The statement also said Johnson's Thursday afternoon press conference was ""an organized law enforcement spectacle.""

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,"" the statement read.

Prosecutors released a four-page document that outlined their case against Smollett, who plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

For the alleged hoax, Smollett solicited the help of two muscular brothers. One of them was Abindola ""Abel"" Osundairo, a friend he worked out with and who worked on the show as a stand-in for another character. He also supplied Smollett with the drug ecstasy, prosecutors said.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx added another bombshell to the ongoing investigation of the “Empire” actor’s claim that he was attacked in a racial and homophobic assault last month in Chicago.

As a grand jury convenes to investigate Smollett’s claims, a spokesperson for Foxx indicated that the recusal was due to “potential questions of impartiality” in the case, FOX 32 Chicago reported. First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats is set to take over the case as acting state’s attorney.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” a spokesperson for Foxx said, according to FOX 32.

Foxx, the first African-American woman to hold the office she was elected to in 2016, gave no further reason for the decision, but it sparked much speculation on Twitter.

I’m told this is why Kim Foxx recused in the Smollett case https://t.co/qEJp6Nz3IM — Jack Posobiec ?? (@JackPosobiec) February 20, 2019

The announcement came as the Chicago Police Department dismissed a tip that Smollett was seen in an elevator in his apartment building the night of the alleged attack along with the two Nigerian brothers who were later arrested and released.

CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives. — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 19, 2019

Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Department, tweeted that the tip was “unfounded.”

Smollett alleged that on Jan. 29 he was attacked by two men who hurled racial and anti-gay slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and also poured a liquid on him while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” The actor’s claims unraveled as police investigations led them to arrest then release two Nigerian brothers who were at first deemed suspects but later considered to have been paid by the actor to stage the attack.

On Tuesday, the two men along with their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, appeared at the Cook County courthouse where they were “ushered in and out of the building in total secrecy,” according to FOX 32. Schmidt had no comment when asked about the case as she reportedly was seen leaving a room marked “Grand Jury.”

The men allegedly did not testify before the grand jury but were “cooperating” in an apparent effort “to build a case against Smollett,” the news outlet reported.

Smollett could face up to three years in prison if he is found guilty of filing a false police report, a felony in Illinois. He could also be facing federal charges if investigators in a separate probe find he had something to do with the hate letter that was sent to him at the “Empire” studios.

In a separate incident, court documents revealed that Smollett was convicted for DUI and providing a police officer with false information in Los Angeles in 2007, according to WLS-TV. With three misdemeanor charges, the actor was sentenced to two years of probation.

Smollett and his attorneys have denied that the alleged attack was staged.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” his attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement last week.

Meanwhile, Foxx’s decision to recuse herself was another plot twist in the ongoing story which left many on social media with more questions than answers.

Jussie Smollett — who is suspected of faking a hate crime against himself — pleaded no contest in 2007 to providing false information to police during a DUI stop in LA, according to a report.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September that year says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake, when he was asked by an officer.

He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court.

Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a license.

Court records show he pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to DUI and driving without a valid license counts.

Smollett, now 36, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a choice of a fine or a jail stint, an LA city attorney’s spokesman told NBC News.

He later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

Multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the current probe told NBC News that the Chicago Police Department has requested the details from their counterparts in Los Angeles.

The old case came to light as authorities investigate whether the “Empire” actor concocted a story about being attacked by racists with a noose and bleach near his apartment in Chicago on Jan. 29.

And the feds are probing whether Smollett was involved in sending a suspicious threat letter to himself a week before the alleged attack."

Recent Article Paints Evangelicals as Evil “White Supremacists”

Where is the relevance between the alleged sins of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary from over 150 years ago to present day evangelism as raised by a recent letter to the editor in a upstate newspaper? There is none, except attempted political linkage in the minds of Trump haters. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in an apology, recently spoke solely for itself in regretting deviating from Biblical Truth over 150 years ago and speaks solely for itself today!

The issue vividly points out the foolishness of listening to self appointed Biblical Teachers and not the Bible! They erred and taught others to err! The views of true evangelicals come from the Word of God not instructors at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary-if they conflict with Biblical teaching: nor, even the Southern Baptist Convention if any doctrinal statement conflicts with the Bible! What the Bible teaches today-it taught then! If the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is ashamed of their past, that is their business-though I can not see how they have any authority today to apologize for the apparently unchanged views of dead people! They certainly can not repent and neither can those they erroneously taught. Any who teach are personally responsible to their maker for their errors-then or now! No one today is responsible for their errors 150 years ago as bad as they were! There is no more real relevance here than a “black face” by a Virginia governor 25 years ago or alleged errors of a Supreme Court Justice 35 years ago. Who each is today is the issue, not what they were accused of decades ago!

The motive of the recent letter writer seems to be an unprovoked and aggressive broad political hack swipe to paint present evangelicals as evil “white supremacists” because they overwhelmingly support President Donald Trump in his secular policies. The writer claims some 80+ percent of evangelicals support President Trump. I would have thought it would be higher! Perhaps the author of that letter has the same political motives, reasoning and credibility as Jussie Smollett in Chicago! Cross accusations now fly! Last year in Chicago there were some 3,000 people shot and hundreds died-men, women, and children! None received the constant Liberal News coverage, views of political hacks, or Hollywood opinions as this simple assault cause!! We know why! We understand the hack political agenda’s from Hollywood and Politicians but the Liberal Media has become an organ to promote a political agenda-not news! Why jump on a simple assault case with no real injuries? The answer is it is not a “news” item but it is polarizing liberal political linkage fodder! Black (racist), Gay (home phobic), Rope (lynching), “MAGA” and Jussie’s hate of Donald Trump:-perfect to stir hate among Democrats for Trump supporters! Perhaps it was a future plot for Empire! The liberal “fake” news does not look for news just political hate linkage with Trump. As far as I know Donald Trump does not teach religion or hate and I have not heard Donald Trump speak against Jesus Christ as many do in this country! Speaking against Jesus Christ is the ultimate sin. Islam pointedly contradicts the Word of God speaking in Jesus Christ! The Koran is false! According to Democrats and liberal media in general, that makes me a bigoted homo Islamaphobic for simply telling the Biblical truth and offending Muslims! There must be some one billion Muslims, sadly, living in darkness! The issue is not skin but truth! Who is Jesus Christ and what did he do ALONE for man! The Bible and Koran dispute each other about Him! No one can be helped unless they are told the truth. To most truth is offensive!

The epithet “White Supremacists” is part of the Democratic Parties’ and Liberal Socialist Media in general, word games! Those who love, practice, and teach sin have always hated those who teach that sin is inherently destructive to individuals (and spiritually separates us from God) and that the destructive qualities of sin should be avoided on earth (evangelicals)! Neither Evangelicals, nor Trump, teach race discrimination or race inferiority or race supremacy! Nor does our guide-the Bible!

Additionally, if you believe people should work for a living and be helped only when they are absolutely unable to help themselves-and such help given by individuals and not given by governments from money (taxes) stolen from people governments don’t like; or, that a woman’s health is not at issue in every coldly calculated murder of an innocent pre-born human baby; or, that homo sexuality is actually destructive to individuals, families and a nation; that a country’s borders should be protected against illegal invasions of masses who want free benefits (do you leave your doors open day and night so folks can enter and get what they feel they need?); that “free love” (adultery-fornication) actually destroys individuals, families and societies; that law breakers should receive the secular penalty for their destructive acts (black or white) against innocents; and, these acts (sins) separate man spiritually from God, you are also homo phobic, Islamaphobic, or other accusing epithets! Democrats have contrary views to evangelicals that they support and advocate-that is their right-but evangelicals have rights too and proudly advocate Jesus Christ as recorded in the Christian Bible! I do not “hate” any one living in the above sins or others. I once stupidly lived a sin controlled life in some of them. My life was once a disgusting mess going in the wrong direction but grace in Jesus Christ changed that! I empathize with them for ignorant sins and hope they come to the truth in Jesus Christ. Sin can be forgiven by God and lives changed! But when people say God is wrong and their “sin” is “not sin”-there is a real problem for them! That is not merely sinful; it is evil to dispute the Word of God. Jesus’ earthly policies are the best for men on earth and His heavenly policy is the ONLY policy (the cross) to reconcile with God! We should pay heed to the teachings of God not the teachings of the Liberal News Media, Democratic Party; or, Islam!"

Malkin's Handy History of Fake Noose

Is it any wonder that American news consumers are at the end of their ropes of patience with the ""mainstream media""?

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett's absurd hate crime claims, few in the ""professional"" journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone's a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone's making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I'm especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I've chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

--Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" claiming she found a ""degrading"" noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried ""systematic racism,"" and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn't add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

--Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism -- until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted ""conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner."" Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

--University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a ""racist display"" of three ""noose-like objects"" hanging from trees. The UD president called it ""deplorable;"" protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the ""nooses"" were metal ""remnants of paper lanterns"" hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

--Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school's library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

--Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the ""noose"" was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who ""may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.""

--Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. ""A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,"" the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the ""noose"" was a ""packaged leather shoelace"" that someone had dropped accidentally.

--Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of ""nooses"" lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the ""latest in a string of hate incidents"" after Trump's election. The African-American museum director called them a ""reminder of America's dark history."" But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

--Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and ""hate signs"" found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett's folly, media sensationalists bluster that there's no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn't take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you've seen one social justice huckster, you've seen 'em all."

Click here for the latest update.

CBS News has learned that a last-minute phone call may have saved ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett from potentially being indicted. Last month, the actor claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack as he walked home in the middle of the night. Two brothers have now told Chicago police Smollett paid them to stage the assault.

A source close to the investigation tells CBS News the brothers were set to appear in front of a grand jury Tuesday. But CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds reports those plans were abruptly scrapped after a ""Hail Mary"" call from Smollett's defense team.

CBS News has learned that Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo were waiting outside the grand jury chambers, just minutes from testifying, when prosecutors got the call from Smollett's lawyers.

It's unclear what the defense said, but the Cook County state's attorney decided to postpone the brothers' testimony, which would have been the first step toward indicting the 36-year-old actor for filing a false police report.

Smollett has repeatedly denied staging the attack.

""I'm pissed off. How do you not believe that? It's the truth!"" he said recently on ""Good Morning America.""

According to a source close to the investigation, after the brothers told police they conspired with Smollett, his lawyers told police he would not do a follow-up interview.

About a dozen search warrants have now been issued, including ones for Smollett's financial and phone records, and detectives are waiting for those records to come back.

The Osundairos told detectives they conspired with Smollett in the fake January 29 attack.

CBS Chicago reports the brothers now also claim Smollett was behind the threatening letter sent to him a week before the alleged assault.

On Tuesday, Smollett's brother and sister posted Instagram messages appearing to criticize media coverage of the case. ""It will make the criminal look like he's the victim and make the victim look like he's the criminal,"" read a quote attributed to Malcolm X.

Two other siblings defended Smollett last week.

Jake Smollett said, ""When one is affected, we are all affected. So it definitely was a time we came together. And we are a strong family.""

Smollett has also denied involvement with the threatening letter.

On Tuesday, in response to reports his scenes in ""Empire"" were being cut, 20th Century Fox and Fox Entertainment said they were standing behind the actor."

2 Separate sources confirm to @tvbrad @SuzanneLeMignot



The brothers told police Jussie Smollett was involved in creating “threatening” letter. @cbschicago — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 19, 2019

The letter, scrawled in red marker, contained letters that appeared to be cut from magazines spelling out a racist and homophobic threat.

In other unconfirmed reports, TMZ says that Smollett has still not spoken with police a second time and has hired attorney Mark Geragos to represent him. If Smollett refuses to speak with police, the case will go to a grand jury, according to TMZ.

On Monday, multiple sources reported that Smollett paid brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage the alleged homophobic and racist attack on him after the aforementioned threatening letter did not receive enough attention. Police have not confirmed those reports.

The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett. One had worked as an extra on the Empire set, and the other was a personal trainer who had worked with the actor. They were reportedly paid $3500 to stage the attack.

The brothers told CBS Chicago: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

CBS Chicago reported: ‘During the search of the brothers’ home last week, a “piece of paper/writing” was also seized. CBS 2 is the only news source with video from inside that house. Police evidence logs exclusively obtained by CBS 2, show investigators took the writing sample, magazine, and a “wallet with stamps.” Chicago police say the FBI is handling the investigation surrounding the letter, because that’s a federal-level concern.

CBS Chicago added: ‘Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500.’

TMZ reported that Smollett and the brothers rehearsed the attack: ‘Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Abel and Ola Osundairo told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor’s apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action. Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to the point he’d be seriously injured. On the night Jussie says he was attacked, the brothers claim they showed up at the scene but were extremely nervous because, just as they played out the scene, a car drove by and they were worried they’d be ID’d.’

TMZ also reported that Smollett’s upcoming scenes in Empirehave been cut.

Chicago police are interested in questioning Smollett again. He has so far refused.

Smollett’s attorneys on Saturday denied he paid the brothers to stage the attack, saying, “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys released a new statement late Sunday: “We are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie Smollett’s lawyers are in contact with the Chicago Police Department. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner that does not include talking to media at this time.”"

Actor Jussie Smollett’s role in TV drama Empire has been slashed in the wake of the news that he staged his alleged homophobic attack. Production sources told tmz.com that Smollett’s five scenes have been cut in the second to last episode of the show.

Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes but now he will have only four scenes. And there will be no proper focus on Smollett in the remaining scenes. They will feature an ensemble cast.

Due to Smollett’s case, the script has also undergone multiple revisions. Last month, Smollett reported to police that he was attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and physically beat him.

Following an investigation, two brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo were arrested by the police who viewed them as “potential suspects”, but they were released later due to lack of evidence. It was later reported that Smollett had staged the attack. Smollett’s case will now be presented before the grand jury."

(Photo: Scott Dudelson, Getty Images for ABA, file)

Chicago – “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

The charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account – something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” – an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” – before fleeing.

Earlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett “continues to be a consummate professional on set” and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

The studio’s statement followed reports that Smollett’s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.

Whispers about Smollett’s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.

Detectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.

The brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.

The day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Referring to a published account of the attack, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that “it doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record – one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Earlier this week, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.

Her office explained Wednesday that Foxx made the decision “out of an abundance of caution” because of conversations she had with one of Smollett’s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx “facilitated a connection” between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.

Foxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.

Two stories you need to know about the 2020 election

The first: Bernie Sanders is running for president again. The 77-year-old independent senator, who ignited a progressive movement with his 2016 campaign, confirmed his candidacy yesterday morning.

His announcement video on Twitter and YouTube revealed what will likely be the core issues of his campaign: single-payer health care, free college tuition, a Green New Deal plan, and his fights against a “corrupt” campaign finance system, a “rigged” economy, and income inequality.

Read Katherine Miller’s story on Sanders’ new run. Here we go again: again.

The second: 2020 campaigns are prioritizing sexual harassment policies in response to #MeToo.

Nine of the top 10 White House hopefuls told us how they are building out their 2020 campaigns and campaign teams while keeping in mind protections against sexual harassment and misconduct.

The Covington Catholic school student who went viral is suing the Washington Post for $250 million

16-year-old Nicholas Sandmann was seen in a viral video, standing face-to-face with a Native American elder, smirking, and saying nothing. He became the face of the story as it ricocheted around the internet.

Now, Sandmann is suing the Post, accusing the news organization of falsely describing him as racist and an instigator of a confrontation.

According to the lawsuit’s claim, the Post failed to verify the context of the video and, as a result, the teen has faced threats, bullying, and damage to his reputation.

Karl Lagerfeld has died at age 85. The fashion legend has been the creative director of Chanel since 1983. Here’s our obituary. Here’s how celebrities are mourning Lagerfeld’s death.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is back at the Supreme Court. The justice attended Tuesday's arguments — the first time she has done so since having surgery for lung cancer in December.

Ariana Grande has matched a feat last achieved by The Beatles. The pop singer is the first artist to claim the top three spots on the Hot 100 since the Fab Four did it in 1964. Grande’s “7 Rings,” “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” and “Thank U, Next” sit at 1, 2 and 3 on the charts respectively.

The future of Jussie Smollett’s character on Empire is unclear as police dispute reports of the alleged attack upon him. Fox had previously vocally supported the actor but now won't comment on a report that Smollett’s character is being cut from upcoming scenes.

Emma Thompson quit a movie after John Lasseter, the Pixar cofounder accused of sexual misconduct, joined. Lasseter was hired as the new head of Skydance Animation. Thompson's exit from Luck comes after the studio’s employees expressed dissatisfaction with Lasseter's hiring.

Trolls are reuploading YouTube kids shows with a clip that encourages self-harm

YouTube has repeatedly come under fire for its inability to manage its content in the last few years, and this certainly won’t help.

Parents are concerned about popular shows on the platform being reuploaded with a spliced-in clip of a man joking about how to cut yourself.

YouTube has had to remove at least two of these videos in the past year after parents discovered them while watching cartoons with their children. Parents say the removal of the videos is not happening nearly fast enough.

A spokesperson for YouTube said the company, which relies on users and automation to flag inappropriate content, “work[s] hard to ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior.”

This bride carried her daughter on her back at her wedding and it’s super sweet

I’m really loving people’s reactions to this story — it’s really connecting with our audience.

When Dalton Mort’s big day came, she knew she wanted her 2-year-old daughter Ellora to play a big role in the wedding.

That’s how it came to be that Dalton carried Ellora strapped to her back as she walked down the aisle. Ellora was, as you can imagine, enthralled with her mother’s hair and decided to play with it a little bit.

Mort even took Ellora down to nurse while the couple exchanged vows. The photos from this day are incredible, you should really have a look. Here’s a sample:"

In general, a tipping point is defined as the “point at which a series of small changes or incidents becomes significant enough to cause a larger, more important change or the critical point in a situation, process, or system beyond which a significant and often unstoppable effect or change takes place.”

In every conflict, there comes a time, usually following a string of heavy losses, when the despair lifts and the outlook brightens and hope returns. It doesn’t mean that the fight is over. In WWII, D-Day was the tipping point, but the Allies still had to endure the Battle of the Bulge. But it does signal the beginning of the end.

Over the last week or so, a series of events have occurred which, if assessed by themselves, might appear meaningless. When considered as a group, however, the synergy created can lead to a meaningful shift.

1. First, disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has stepped into the spotlight. (You really have to wonder why McCabe, who remains under a criminal investigation, believes that now is a good time to publish a book and embark on a media tour.)

He presents himself more as one who is trying to defend himself than as a reasonable, credible leader who acted out of genuine concern for US national security. He still can’t offer any reasons why he opened a criminal investigation of Trump other than he “believed that there might be a threat to national security.” Trump’s firing of Comey is not evidence of obstruction of justice.

In the exchanges below with CNN’s Anderson Cooper and NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, please note my emphasis of words such as “I think, it’s possible, there might be, the President himself might in fact be a threat, in our view, potentially impact, possibly turn off, we thought it might be possible, if you believe that the President might have obstructed justice.”

Cooper asked him if he still believes that the President is a Russian asset. McCabe replied, “I think it’s possible. I think that’s why we started the investigation and I’m anxious to see where Director Mueller concludes that.”

Appearing on NBC with Savanah Guthrie, McCabe was asked if he believed Trump was a threat to national security. He replied:

We had information that led us to believe that there might be a threat to national security. In this case, that the President himself might be in fact be a threat to the United States’ national security. The president, in our view, had gone to extreme measures to potentially impact— negatively impact, possibly turn off— our investigation of Russian meddling into the election, and Russian coordination with his campaign. We thought that it might be possible [that Trump was working for Russia] … you have to ask yourself, if you believe that the President might have obstructed justice for the purpose of ending our investigation into Russia, you have to ask yourself why. Why would any President of the United States not want the FBI to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our election?

He is very careful to avoid any definitive statements about Trump’s wrongdoing because he knows that would come back to bite him. He’s an FBI agent. He knows how to avoid traps.

He then claimed that no one in the ‘Gang of Eight’ objected to their investigation. The ‘Gang of Eight’ at that time included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-NC), then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, then-House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA), Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi D-CA), and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA).

Knowing that members of the ‘Gang of Eight’ are not allowed to discuss what was said in their meetings, he tells NBC’s Savannah Guthrie that everyone was on board. I find it unbelievable that all 8 members agreed with opening the investigation, especially Devin Nunes, who worked tirelessly to expose the deep state.

McCabe: I told Congress what we had done. Guthrie: Did anyone object? McCabe: That’s the important part here, Savannah. No one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds and not based on the facts.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) appeared on Fox News’ Martha MacCallum’s show and said that was not so.

The reason he’s doing it this way is that Devin Nunes and Paul Ryan are not allowed to discuss anything that’s said in a ‘Gang of Eight’ meeting and McCabe knows that. So he can level the accusation and Devin and Paul cannot refute him. There were three investigations into a duly elected president. The Peter Strzok one from July of 2016 and then McCabe started a counterintelligence [probe] and if he’s telling the truth, started a criminal probe into the president of the United States. I listened to Devin and Paul quiz the [Justice Department] and the FBI for hours on multiple occasions about the one counterintelligence investigation, we all knew about it. I find it stunning that they would know about a second one and not say a single solitary word.

McCabe’s media tour, in my opinion, has only diminished the already weak case against President Trump. And it has likely reinforced the perception in voters’ minds that McCabe truly is the liar DOJ IG Michael Horowitz believes him to be.

2. The Hill’s John Solomon and investigative reporter Sara Carter appeared together on Sean Hannity’s show on Tuesday night. Both have followed the Trump/Russian collusion probe closely.

Solomon spoke about a bombshell revelation he will be posting today about a third dossier prepared by Fusion GPS. He said:

We know about the Steele dossier, we know about the Blumenthal dossier that was sent to the State Department and forwarded to the FBI. Tomorrow, I’m gonna report that there was a third dossier put together and given to the Justice Department using Fusion GPS materials and when you hear who wrote it, who gave it to the Justice Department and who knew about it, you’re gonna love this.

He didn’t want to give the story away, but he gave Sean a clue that pointed to Nellie Ohr, wife of Bruce Ohr.

Sara Carter discussed how for over a year now, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency have “impeded” efforts by Republican lawmakers to review the “unmasking” requests of Obama Administration officials. Very little has been reported about the unmasking of over 100 Americans.

Hannity then discussed Victor Davis Hanson’s article (I posted about it here) in which he declared the coup against Trump to be dead. Hannity asked them both if they “believe that things are now closing in on those deep state people that tried to rig a presidential election and undo a duly elected President, breaking the law and doing nefarious and illegal things?”

Solomon: I do believe that the truth is coming out about the small group of people at the top of the Justice Department and the FBI tried to undo what the American voters did and do it in ways that were in violation of the law and the regulations they were supposed to adhere to. Carter: Sean, what we’re seeing is a silent coup and if the Justice Department doesn’t open up an investigation, then it’s a disservice to the American people. (The segment begins at 24:00 in the video below.)

3. Jussie Smollett’s stunt provided a clear example of just how far those on the left are willing to take their hatred of conservatives. Americans have been riveted by the developments in this case. Smollett, as he navigates his way through the legal consequences he will surely face, will be a walking, talking reminder of how extreme the Democratic party has become.

4. William Barr was confirmed by a senate vote of 54-45. (One senator did not vote.) 51 Republicans voted yes and one voted no. Three Democrats voted yes and 41 voted no.

Most reader comments express deep concern that Barr may be part of the deep state and therefore, will not do what’s necessary to clean up the mess and to hold people accountable. I would argue first that, after the damage done to his presidency by Jeff Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from oversight of the collusion investigation, Trump probably was very careful to vet Barr before nominating him. Second, Barr has been critical of the Mueller investigation in the past which is why only three Democrats voted for his confirmation. Third, this has been the most consequential, most destructive scandal in American political history. Does William Barr, after a long and respected career in law enforcement want to be remembered by history for his corruption? He has an opportunity to shine. I don’t believe he will be so quick to squander it because of his good buddy Robert Mueller.

Too much is known about the poisonous actions taken by this group of unelected government officials who have wielded such power. Although Democrats have moved so far to the left and would like nothing better than to see the US become a socialist state, which they, of course, would control, the majority of Americans oppose such a radical transformation. This feels like a pivotal moment in history. Let’s keep up the momentum."

Jussie Smollett might have faked a racist, homophobic assault. That’s cool. I’m cool with that. I’m sure we’re all cool with that, no one’s bothered.

Of course people are bothered. Jesus, how could anyone not be? Look, I’m not going to decide right now if it really was faked because at this point, it won’t even matter. Now that the idea that he faked it has entered the discourse, people who want to believe it was staged are -- no matter the outcome -- going to see it the way they want to and never change their minds. The truth is, whatever happened doesn’t change anything about being LGBTQ in America. I’ll let the folks who care more about celebrity drama deal with Smollett’s problem; I’m more concerned about what people think it means.

One of the first things I saw pertaining to this was some rando who has some severely wounded ego problems to work through regarding the TV actor. Apparently, he thought that he and all straight men deserved some sort of apology if Smollett made it up. Knowing he’s not the only goon who thinks that for some reason, let me just say; We don’t owe you shit. It’s been legal to be gay in this country for only about 15 years. No, really. Let me just remind you that until Lawrence v. Texas, being gay or “committing sodomy” as they put it, was illegal in 14 states and we’ve only been able to legally marry for less than five. Half of America still has no hate crimes legislation for LGBTQ people, and about the same number have no job protections. WE have nothing to apologize for, YOU still owe us an apology for decades of discrimination and violence that is still going on. Hell, you owe us an apology for the fact that just this month, South Dakota advanced a bill to make it illegal for teachers in their schools to even mention transgender people. But you expect us to apologize for reacting emotionally to a report of anti-LGBTQ violence.

In fact, anti-LGBTQ violence has been increasing, so we’re a bit touchy about that subject. In fact, according to a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, at least one LGBTQ person was murdered per week, on average, from a hate-based crime in 2017. My twitter feed just this weekend showed me a group of gay people being harassed and assaulted in Salt Lake City by a drunken club goer, as well as a queer woman who had a full beer can thrown at her from a car, which hit her in the head. You wonder why we’re jumpy and reactionary?

Portland, Ore., a place I have been told repeatedly is this amazing center of left-wing love, tolerance, and progressive politics, has apparently been subject to a rash of anti-LGBTQ violence to the point that community leaders are organizing meetings. Of course, the Portland police say that have no reports of this violence, but when your police department has been alleged to be rather chummy with the Proud Boys and other violent alt-right protestors, the LGBTQ community might not be keen on calling those cops for help.

For a lot of LGBTQ people, violence and discrimination is honestly just another day. Many don’t live in states and cities that have non-discrimination laws. Many don’t have safe cloistered “gayborhoods” they can live and go out to. For most, there are no conveniently timed videos made on phones, or even sympathetic local news outlets. For most, they’re just happy they lived through it and go about their day. Transgender people had to create their own day of remembrance for their victims of violence because most people weren’t even aware they existed in the first place. Hell, I’m transgender and don’t catch wind of all of the stories. For every victim of a hate crime you hear about, there’s no doubt in my mind that there are four more you don’t. Either they don’t report it, or it doesn’t have the sexy appeal that a sensationalized media looks for and so it remains buried in some police blotter to be forgotten about.

Jussie Smollett faking his assault or not is just a distraction. What happens to him and his career as an actor means nothing to me because there’s another 5,000 actors waiting to take his place. If we lived in a fair and just world, instead of focusing on this absurd drama of “did he or didn’t he,” we would be using this to launch a much larger conversation about anti-LGBTQ violence -- instead we’re going to be absorbed into this stupid scandal and miss the big picture. That's the bigger crime here."

The Hosts Try To Make Sense of The Jussie Smollett Case

Adrienne Houghton: I think when we first heard this, I think obviously we were all outraged, it’s terrible, no one should ever be harmed in such a way… right? And so we reacted really big to that. Now there’s this new information. I just don’t want to react again big. And that’s a conscious decision I am choosing to make for myself, it is not being so reactive. Just take a moment try to get all the information… that’s kind of where I’m at with it you know?

[The Real audience applauds]

Jeannie Mai: I hear you.

Adrienne: It’s disappointing, it’s sad and God forbid this is true, it’s awful.

Jeannie: That part, right? If this is true, this is, in my life, the most deplorable violation of our trust that victimizes Black people, gay people, and reinforces the idea that all Trump supporters are white supremacists, which we know is not true. And the crazy thing is Black, queer people are struggling to fight for their lives every single day…

[The Real audience applauds]

Jeannie: …and for this to even… yes…

Adrienne: Terrible.

Jeannie: For this to diminish their stories and make it even harder for their voices to be heard hurts me the most.

[EDIT]

Tamera: With this story, personally, especially knowing someone, my mind is like all over the place, and it’s because his character that I know, doesn’t match the things that are coming out. But the truth is, you know …the truth.

Adrienne: Something’s coming out.

Tamera: Something… something is, is coming out. So… it’s concerning to me, the reports, I’m concerned for him… and this is the thing: the law is the law. Just because we’re celebrities or whatever – you can’t act above the law.

Adrienne: Correct.

Tamera: Eventually, stuff is going to, you know, come out. But I feel like maybe I’m, I’m… not allowing myself to accept certain things because I don’t want it to be true.

Adrienne: Yes.

Jeannie: Of course.

Tamera: Because I know him. And then if it is true, exactly what you’re saying – it don’t look good. That’s, that’s, that’s not a good look.

So, Jussie Smollett was lying.

The “Empire” actor claimed that when he was walking home at 2 a.m. in Chicago, in the midst of the polar vortex, he was accosted by two assailants, both of whom shouted anti-gay and anti-black slurs at him. They then attempted to throw a noose around his neck and pour what he thought was bleach on him while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” he says.

None of this is true. Police now believe that Smollett paid two of his friends to stage the entire attack.

Why, exactly, would Smollett do it? He is a successful actor on a hit television show. He’s been continuously working in Hollywood for years, with roles in the 2017 films “Marshall” and “Alien: Covenant.” He’s not exactly a textbook victim.

The answer to this question makes for some uncomfortable lessons.

First, alleged victims sometimes have an incentive to lie. For several years, each time an alleged victim tells an unverified and unverifiable story, we are told that we must believe that victim’s story. Why? Because why would the victim lie? But this is often untrue. Smollett had an incentive to lie: unending media attention, fawning sycophancy from politicians and the potential for even greater Hollywood stardom. If Smollett had gotten away with his hoax, he’d be the face of gay, black suffering in the United States. Few had heard of Smollett before this story. Suddenly, he found himself on “Good Morning America,” telling the world about his own bravery. That’s a lucrative career path.

Second, hoaxers can read the tea leaves. There’s a reason that the most prominent racial and sexual hoaxes have generally flattered the political sensibilities of the political left. Right-wing hoaxes might catch the attention of right-wing sources, but left-wing sources are far more powerful and plentiful. Imagine if a MAGA-hatted young Republican had accused two young black men of assaulting him while shouting, “F— Trump!” That story might get play on talk radio and Fox News, but it wouldn’t earn one iota of attention from celebrity culture or the mainstream media.

Third, social media makes hoaxes infinitely easier. There are large-scale incentives for jumping on every story before the facts are clear, which is why both Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., both running for president, tweeted their support for Smollett … and then had to backtrack radically, suggesting as the hoax emerged that they had to wait for more facts. Being the first to rip America bears political fruit; waiting for the whole story often earns public castigation for insufficient sensitivity.

All of this means that the hoaxes won’t stop anytime soon. The incentives simply aren’t aligned for hoaxes to end. Media members are too eager to buy into stories that support their preferred narratives; social media is too eager to engage in pile-ons of epic proportions; hoaxers are obviously eager to make a buck or win some fame. Which means that we should all wait next time we hear a story too good to be true.

But we won’t. Nobody knows who the next Jussie Smollett will be. But within a few weeks, we’ll surely know.

Police want to ask Smollett additional questions about the attack he reported on January 29, but as of Tuesday morning, Smollett’s attorneys had not indicated when their client will be available to talk to police. Smollett told authorities that two men attacked him, putting a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

Two brothers, who were arrested and released in connection with the attack, met with police and prosecutors at a Chicago courthouse on Tuesday, Chicago police spokesman Tom Ahern said. The county’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, has recused herself from the investigation, according to a spokeswoman from her office.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” said the spokeswoman, Tandra Simonton.

The men — who attorney Gloria Schmidt identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — were arrested February 13 but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.” The two are no longer suspects at this time, Chicago police have said.

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM, the men said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

On Monday, Anne Kavanaugh with Media Pros 24/7, a firm representing Smollett, released a statement saying in part, “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett charged with providing false information to law enforcement in 2007 misdemeanor case

More than a decade ago, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case, according to Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.

The case stems from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police the wrong name.

Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver license.

He was sentenced to two years of probation and paid a fine, according to Mateljan.

Police looking into whether Smollett paid the brothers

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement and that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama “Empire.”

Letter addressed to Smollett before alleged attack included the word ‘MAGA”

Seven days before the alleged attack, a letter containing white powder was sent to the Chicago set of “Empire,” Chicago police have said. Authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

The image of the letter and envelope, shared with CNN by a person close to Smollett, includes a message apparently cut from magazine clippings, and a stick figure drawing. Smollett told ABC News the drawing was of a “stick figure hanging from a tree which had a gun pointing towards it.” The letter, addressed to Smollett, includes the word “MAGA” on the outside of the envelope in place of the return address.

What happened

According to to Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled “‘Empire’ fa***t” and “‘Empire’ n***er'” while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as “potential suspects” then. But by Friday night they had been released, Guglielmi said.

One of the men has appeared on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Smollett has expressed frustration about not being believed

Smollett gave his first detailed account last week of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in the interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted “this is MAGA country” before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”"

TRUMP WH ‘EXPLORING EVERY LEGAL OPTION’ TO RECLAIM MONEY FROM DEFUNCT CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROJECT: The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is exploring ""every legal option"" to reclaim $2.5 billion in federal funds spent by California on its now-defunct high-speed rail project, and also that it intends to cancel $928 million in federal grants not yet paid for the project to link Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.

The move was a dramatic escalation in the ongoing war of words and policy between California and the White House. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declared during his State of the State address last week that he was shelving plans for the $77 billion rail project that had been championed by environmental groups, admitting that ""as currently planned, [it] would cost too much and take too long.""

A graduate of Northwestern University and Harvard Law School, Rosen previously served as general counsel and senior policy adviser for the White House Office of Management and Budget (2006-2009) and as general counsel at the Department of Transportation (2003-2006), according to his online biography.

COVINGTON HIGH STUDENT'S LEGAL TEAM SUES WASHINGTON POST: Attorneys representing a Kentucky high school student involved in a confrontation that went viral on social media last month announced Tuesday that they were suing the Washington Post for $250 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Kentucky, accuses the Post of practicing ""a modern-day form of McCarthyism"" by targeting Nicholas Sandmann and ""using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles ... to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.""

COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY RECUSES HERSELF FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE: The Cook County state's attorney has recused herself from the investigation surrounding Jussie Smollett, as Chicago police continue to dig into the alleged hate crime attack the actor claims occurred last month.

State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself Tuesday, but it was not immediately clear why. First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats will take over the case as acting state's attorney, Fox News has learned.

A NARRATIVE TO BE PROMOTED – ""A lot of people bought into the Jussie Smollett narrative, which is that Trump supporters are stalking black people all around America seeking to beat them, seeking to harass them, and this was a perfect story.

That creeping — and creepy — leftist relationship with the truth became apparent before Donald Trump was placed in the progressive crosshairs. The unofficial onset of the burgeoning facts-don’t-matter subculture came with the debunking of the infamous “hands up, don’t shoot.” The left asserted that the actual facts of the Michael Brown hoax perpetrated on the unwitting folks of Ferguson, MO, and the rest of the nation were largely irrelevant because, more importantly, it advanced a critical narrative about racist cops and a racist nation.

Narrative uber alles. To hell with the truth or the collateral damage. And Ferguson turned out to be just a dress rehearsal for what happened after the evil Trump was elected president.

Well, with the crumbling, preposterous story of Jussie Smollett — a two-fer since it demonstrated both the racism and homophobia of Trump-supporting scum — it is now beyond time to turn the whole narrative thing around on the left. Only we shall do it with actual facts.

How has the left attempted to fabricate hatred and bigotry among the Trump faithful — and other beneficiaries of white privilege? Let us count the ways. The number of documented hoaxes by the real haters, many of which occurred shortly after the election of President Trump, will astound you.

William Tucker, 58, of southern New Jersey was arrested by Philadelphia police for vandalizing multiple vehicles and homes the day after Trump was elected. In an effort to smear Trump and his supporters, he had written messages like “Trump Rules” and “Black B*tch” on an African-American woman’s car and also allegedly spray-painted Trump’s name next to a Nazi swastika on a storefront window.

As Babson College students Parker Rand-Ricciardi and Edward Tomasso drove through Wellesley College in celebration of Trump’s victory, other students claimed Ricciardi and Tomasso harassed onlookers, spitting and yelling slurs at anti-Trump students. Police found no evidence to support the hate crime claims.

Similarly, a black female student at Villanova University alleged that after Trump’s victory, a group of white men knocked her to the ground as they yelled “Trump.” The woman later dropped the charges and asked campus police and local authorities to shut down their investigations.

Taylor Volk, a student at North Park University in Chicago, said six days after the election that she had received notes and e-mails containing homophobic slurs and Trump references. University President David Parkyn confirmed that the student had fabricated the entire story.

A woman who posted to her Facebook page that she had been sexually assaulted by Trump supporters admitted to making up the story because she was “distraught over the recent election.”

In December 2016, a Muslim student at the University of Michigan faked a hate crime attack, alleging that a white man threatened to light her hijab on fire. The woman managed to escape punishment.

In a similar hate hoax case in the month after Trump’s victory, a New York City Muslim woman claimed that she was attacked by a group of Trump supporters on a subway train, an incident that the New York City Police Department said did not happen. Yasmin Seweid, 18, was charged with filing a fraudulent police report.

In Ann Arbor, MI, that same month, a Muslim student’s claim that she was threatened for wearing her hijab also was discovered to be untrue.

A white man, David Williams of Denton, TX, claimed to have been the victim of a racist hate crime after someone wrote “n*gger lovers” on his garage door. After police opened an arson and hate crime investigation into the incident, Williams admitted he had done the whole thing himself.

In Volusia County, FL, 27-year-old Vincent Palmer perpetrated a similar hoax, ultimately admitting to local police that he wrote a message using racial slurs with “KKK” and “Trump” references and taped to his ex-girlfriend’s car just before throwing a brick through the back window, dousing it in gasoline, and setting it ablaze.

Two students at Williams College in Massachusetts also hoaxed an incident, pouring fake blood on staircases of a building and spelling out “AMKKK KILL” on the walls.

A Muslim student in Lafayette, LA, made up a story that she was robbed and her hijab was pulled from her head by Trump supporters.

In June 2017, three black students at the University of Albany — Alexis Briggs, Asha Burwell, and Ariel Agudio — each received three years of probation and 200 hours of community service after police concluded that they had fabricated a story about a group of white men attacking them on a bus. The women charged that they had been called the n-word and verbally assaulted. The so-called hate crime whipped Black Lives Matter and the Albany campus into a frenzy and kicked off the Twitter hashtag campaign #DefendBlackGirlsUAlbany.

In December 2018, a student at Drake University, Kissie Ram, admitted to sending racist notes to herself and others and arranging white supremacist robocalls in an attempt to stir up race-based outrage. Ram was eventually outed and threatened with expulsion, but not before the school’s president preached, “We still have a lot of work to do to create the welcoming and supportive community we aspire to be ….The forces of hate are mobilized, but they don’t control us or what happens on our campus,” and thousands of Drake students, staff, and alumni rallied against racism on campus.

Two months earlier, a 19-year-old from Long Island, NY, Adwoa Lewis, told detectives that four teenagers confronted her as she drove home, yelling “Trump 2016!” and telling her she did not belong there. Lewis also claimed that she woke up the next morning to find her car’s tires slashed and a note with the words “Go home.” The entire story was made up, and Lewis was charged with making a false written statement.

So here we see a lengthy pattern of anti-Trump hoaxes perpetrated by leftists since the 2016 election. It seems unlikely that these damnable lies were coordinated or orchestrated. But since most of these false stories garnered spectacular headlines, they prove that the left’s belief in narrative over facts represents a clear and present danger to America. For as it was once said, and is especially true in this global internet age, a lie travels around the globe while the truth is putting on its shoes.

In the end remains an obvious question: If leftists must resort to breaking the law with false and scurrilous accusations in order to undergird their narrative, how real can the narrative be?"

Hamilton won eight of the final 11 races as he collected his fifth world crown last year, equalling Juan Manuel Fangio’s haul and moving to within two of Michael Schumacher‘s record.

Rosberg, the last driver to get the better of Hamilton in 2016 before promptly retiring, expects the likes of Sebastian Vettel and new Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to be strong contenders.

But speaking ahead of the Laureus World Sports Awards, the German suspects his old rival, who begins pre-season testing at Barcelona on Monday, will reign supreme once more.

“Lewis is the absolute favourite again because he’s driving incredibly lately and his team does an incredible job,” Rosberg said.

“He’s one of the most successful F1 drivers of all time, one of the most successful sportsmen of all time.

“I think the odds are in his favour then Sebastian is the obvious challenger. But I would also, if I was a betting man, say Leclerc or Verstappen because I think both of them can be a big, big surprise this year.”

There has been some technical tweaks in the off-season, which includes teams having a new front wing design that F1 bosses hope will lead to tighter races.

Rosberg said: “There’s an huge opportunity for things to switch around this year. Maybe suddenly Red Bull is the team to beat, that’s possible.

“It’s really put everything back in time and everybody has to start from scratch again, it’s really exciting because nobody knows where the teams are going to be.”

Rosberg thinks the pressure may be on compatriot Vettel this season after finishing runner-up to Hamilton for a second successive year.

Vettel has been the undisputed main man at Ferrari since switching to the Italian marque four years ago but he has failed to add to the four world titles he won at Red Bull.

A series of uncharacteristic errors undermined his efforts last year and, with highly-rated Leclerc now his team-mate, Rosberg believes his former rival needs to deliver.

Rosberg added: “The Mercedes car was the best car in all those years, except maybe for the last time where it might have been equal.

“In all the years, Sebastian is still one of the best drivers out there, he just had a poor season last year and made a lot of mistakes but the team also made a lot of mistakes.

“It was a joint effort and they all did bad, that can happen, but they need to turn it around this year.

“If Sebastian does a season like last year then Leclerc will end up in front of him at the end of the year. Sebastian needs to nail it this year.”

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

And because of that, we surmise, he is said to be on the verge of becoming Jussie Smollett‘s new criminal defense rep in court.

Some say they saw this move coming when Geragos appeared on CNN on Monday evening and made an interesting case for supporting Smollett, all while painting Chicago Police Department in unfavorable terms. In other words, he threw major shade at the Chi-town police. He suggested the leaks coming from the police were a thinly veiled attempt to skewer the actor.

Here’s more from TMZ:

We realized what was up the second Geragos appeared on Anderson Cooper’s show and made repeated contacts with Geragos trying to find out if he was representing him — it was the only way to read his comments. Geragos did not get back to us.

There are now reports he is close to representing the actor who is now in the crosshairs of the police department.

TMZ broke the story, a grand jury is about to convene to hear evidence as to whether Smollett should be indicted on the felony charge of filing a false police report.

Smollett has vehemently maintained the attack was real.

Getting back to Smollett’s possible problem with the police, his current legal team (Chicago defense attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson), with or without Geragos, are standing arm-in-arm to keep their client from another formal session with the CPD, according to Deadline.

Meanwhile, there’s been no sit-down scheduled despite repeated requests by the Chicago police, the department continues asking lawyers and reps for the actor for a chance to be able to talk to Smollett again. As suspicion and the spotlight of the investigation seems now to be centering on Smollett himself, the CPD want more information about what happened in the early hours of January 29, when two men reportedly attacked the “Empire“ star near his Windy City his apartment.

At this point, based on information obtained from the Osundario brothers and others, the CPD are trying to find out whether the attack might have been pre-planned and with an agenda."

The left would expect mere mortals to understand that as opposed to them, the left rises above the rumormongering and misinformation of social media. As with so much else regarding the left, that's nonsense. It cuts, pastes and amplifies the unsubstantiated ardor of liberal Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at will — if it advances the narrative. See the case of Jussie Smollett, actor/singer in the Fox hip-hop drama ""Empire.""



Smollett's ""MAGA country"" hate-crime hoax is just the latest example. Coming on the heels of the smears of Covington Catholic High School MAGA hat-wearing teens, we must conclude the left is too blind, or too stupid, or maybe just doesn't give a hoot.



Nothing says ""viral"" like a black gay celebrity claiming he was beaten by Trumpster thugs. For two weeks, the left went nuts. Celebrities took to the celebrity talk shows, politicians to the political talk shows and the ""news"" media to the ""news"" media to denounce racist conservative Trump World.

Now the actor's ""modern-day lynching"" narrative, as Sen. Cory Booker declared it, has imploded. As we've come to expect, the arrogant defenders of the ""high-quality news organizations"" are once again refusing to take responsibility for the gasoline they tossed on the fire.



See ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter of the so-called ""Facts First"" network. He claimed, ""ultimately, this is not about the media, or about politicians or activists, or any other people that might have been fooled. It's about Jussie.""



Translation: It's all about the fooler ... not the fools.



Later, in his email newsletter, Stelter asked: ""Was it newsworthy when the police opened an investigation into Smollett's accusation? Yes. Did high-quality news organizations approach the case with caution? Yes.""

This is pure nonsense, and Stelter knows it. The national media jumped into the allegations like children jump into a mud puddle. Only ABC, CBS and NBC have devoted 157 morning and evening minutes to the Smollett fraud. Some of these stories call the fraud ""alleged."" Some didn't even bother.

Compare. Two years ago in that same city, there was another attack. Four black thugs bound and gagged an innocent, defenseless 18-year-old mentally disabled white man. He was beaten, kicked, made to drink from a toilet bowl and bloodied from cuts to his scalp. The suspects laughed at him and shouted, ""F—- Trump"" and ""F—- white people."" The entire attack was captured on video — and streamed live on Facebook. They were arrested; he went into the emergency room. ""If it bleeds, it leads""? Not on your life, not something like this. The networks gave the story and all its gore a whopping 27 seconds that night.



Smollett's story collapsed shortly after ABC's Robin Roberts gave him an embarrassingly supportive interview. Call the show ""Good Fawning America."" Roberts did not approach with ""caution."" She chose not to use the word ""alleged."" It was true because he said so, and she wanted to believe him because she believes this is what Trump supporters do. She asked, ""What do feel people need to hear the most from this story?"" Smollett said, ""just the truth."" Her most ridiculous question was this: ""If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?""

Oh, he knew the attackers. Very well.



Kudos to Michelle Malkin, who called out the media early for not asking these obvious questions:



How many racist homophobes wander around an upscale neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach and yelling about ""MAGA country""?



How many racist homophobes have heard of ""Empire"" and could recognize Jussie Smollett from his gay character on the show?



Red flags were visible everywhere, including the fact that the Chicago police told Malkin they initially hadn't heard the ""MAGA country"" claims. Early claims that Smollett had broken ribs were false.



President Trump, no doubt advised not to mutter ""fake news"" about the story, called the story ""horrible."" But in the end, it underlined why so many conservatives feel the ""news"" business isn't defined by the maxim ""Facts First."" It's ""Fakes First.""

WASHINGTON — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination again, a decision that will test whether he can still generate the progressive energy that fueled his insurgent 2016 campaign.

“Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump,” the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist said in an email to supporters. “Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.”

An enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals such as “Medicare-for-all” and free college tuition, Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton. While she ultimately became the party’s nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.

Flynn pushed to share nuclear tech with Saudis, report says

WASHINGTON — Senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials, according to a new congressional report citing whistleblowers within the Trump administration.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the U.S. technology were transferred without proper safeguards.

The Democratic-led House oversight committee opened an investigation Tuesday into the claims by several unnamed whistleblowers who said they witnessed “abnormal acts” in the White House regarding the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The report raises concerns about whether some in a White House marked by “chaos, dysfunction and backbiting” sought to circumvent national security procedures to push a Saudi deal that could financially benefit close supporters of the president.

The report comes at a time when lawmakers are increasingly uneasy with the close relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia, which has raised alarms even among members of the president’s party in Congress. Trump has made the kingdom a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the Middle East as he tries to further isolate Iran. In the process, he has brushed off criticism over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ role in the war in Yemen.

Police: Tip that Smollett, two brothers together in elevator

CHICAGO — Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

The outcry, as always, was immediate, as is the case in all incidents that cast conservatives in a poor light. The attack was recently exposed as a likely staged incident set up by Smollett himself, who was angry that a racist letter sent to him did not get more exposure. Instead of casting the letter, a real instance of racism, to the forefront, Smollett chose to furnish an elaborate hoax that fooled the identity politics watchdogs of the media.

Smollett’s mistake was crafting the hoax to fit the left’s narrative too perfectly. A pair of white men in Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats and ski masks beating a black man and leaving him with a noose around his neck? Too good to be true. Some knew immediately that something was suspicious. Rational thinkers decided to wait for all the facts to present themselves. Police had no suspects and Jussie did not want to talk to police. It was good enough for the media, though, who rallied in support of Smollett just as they did for Nathan Phillips, the Native American from the Covington Catholic incident. Despite the media’s conclusions, the investigative work of Chicago police revealed that Smollett paid two Nigerian men to carry out the attack. Such desperation can only be found in today’s political climate. A justifiably disgruntled Smollett wanted retribution for a wrong. However, instead of bringing to light a very real racist letter, he decided to create a spectacle, jeopardizing the credibility of any future high-profile hate crime claims.

In the process of perpetuating his lie, Smollett interviewed with Robin Roberts. During the session, he masterfully concocted some tears and self-pity. When asked why he was targeted, he cited his willingness to harshly criticize President Trump. This was the point at which everyone should have discovered that this was all a play to further an agenda. An appeal to the emotions of a nation stirred up by every single claim, every single unsubstantiated report. Jussie was dealt an excellent hand, but his heavy-handedness, unwillingness to cooperate with police and the far-too-convenient story made him the current face of everything wrong with outrage culture.

This is not the first incident where the media immediately assumed that the perpetrator of a hate crime was a white Trump supporter. In early November, after the horrific anti-Semitic shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, a different synagogue was vandalized in New York with despicable phrases like “Jews better be ready” and “Die Jew rats, we are here.” The media initially jumped onto this act of cowardice and blamed white conservatives, per usual. After evidence was finally collected, the perpetrator turned out to be a young African American man who worked on the Obama campaign. He was even profiled at one point by the NYT for his help in the 2008 election. The initial claims of angry MAGA hats attacking the Jewish community could not have been further from the truth.

Parallel to the issue of manufactured hate is the left’s refusal to acknowledge actual anti-Semites, such as Democratic leaders Louis Farrakhan and Ilhan Omar. Farrakhan, hailed as a great figurehead and spiritual leader in the African American community, is very open about his anti-Jewish sentiments and has claimed, “The powerful Jews are my enemy,” and “White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through.” Farrakhan’s continued relevance despite the hatred in his heart and words is astounding. Ilhan Omar’s recent comments have cast a shadow on her tenure in office, originally hailed as a great win for diversity. Sadly, it appears that Omar does not hold the same love of inclusion as most Americans. While she did “apologize” for implying that the government was being controlled by so-called “Jewish money,” her comments immediately following her apology doubled down on her original statement. It is incredibly disappointing to see that anti-Semitism on the left is either ignored or repaired with a half-hearted apology, while those on the right are accused of violent, fictional hate crimes.

While the public knows that the accountability of the media (on both sides) has been questionable, the handling of the Jussie Smollett hoax is particularly disturbing. Hate crimes should never be used as a spark to create more hate for the perpetrators, but should instead be seen as a call to help the oppressed. If the U.S. hopes to see a future without racism, people will need to set aside their prejudices. On top of this, they must stop their search for oppression that simply is not there. Only then will unity be possible.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked the audience to let her address ""the elephant in the room"" before she went any further.

The crowd waited for her to continue...Was it about her record as a prosecutor and attorney general? Was it about her position on climate change or health care? Was it about the Jussie Smollett case, which she’d been asked about by a reporter earlier in the day?

""I intend to compete in New Hampshire,"" she said at the Monday event. ""I intend to spend time here. I intend to shake every hand that I possibly can. I want to talk with you, I want to listen to you, I want to be challenged by you.""

It was one of several times Harris made the point during her visit. ""I plan on doing well here,"" she said in her opening remarks at a Politics and Eggs breakfast at St. Anselm College on Tuesday.

From the outside, it might have seemed too obvious to mention: Why would a presidential candidate be there if not to campaign?

But in a state that can be prickly about defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and whose voters like to see their candidates up close and often, Harris was aware she may have some skeptics. After all, it wasn't just her first campaign stop in New Hampshire — it was her first visit to the state.

The freshman Democrat's path to her party's nomination runs more through South Carolina, where black women are a potentially decisive voting bloc, and California, where her home-state advantage could help her earn a trove of delegates days later.

""People in New Hampshire were worried when she got in the race that she'd focus on Iowa and South Carolina and skip New Hampshire or give it token attention,"" Chris Galdieri, an associate professor at St. Anselm College, told NBC News.

Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha

Harris faces tough competition headlined by 2016 New Hampshire primary winner Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and fellow New Englander Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., among others, but writing off the state would be a risk for Harris. Prior candidates who planned on using later contests to jump start their runs have sometimes fizzled out with weak performances in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""From her perspective, she doesn't need to win, but she does need to do well,"" Galdieri said.

So far, so good. If Harris was suffering from hurt feelings among voters who expected her to be there sooner, there wasn't any evidence at her events.

In Portsmouth, a line of hundreds of people stretched around the block in the freezing snow to attend her town hall. Harris stopped by the crowd outside before the event and at an indoor spillover area to thank them for coming and to apologize that the venue had unfortunately reached its capacity at 1,500 people.

""There's certainly a level of excitement (around her visit),"" said Raymond Buckley, the state Democratic Party chairman. ""Very few New Hampshire Democrats have actually met her.""

Addressing the audience, Harris hit her campaign themes of ""truth and justice,"" telling the crowd it was time to face facts and confront issues like inequality and racism. She drew big applause declaring her support for Medicare For All and for the Green New Deal. She told one person in attendance that she'd support a proposal to rename Columbus Day ""Indigenous Peoples' Day.""

Harris also put a heavy emphasis on criminal justice reform, an area where her prosecutorial background has been a double-edged sword.

""We have failed to put the resources into our public education system and instead we are putting tons of money into a system of mass incarceration,"" she said in Portsmouth. The next day she called the war on drugs ""an abject failure.""

Several voters at her event volunteered that they saw her law-and-order experience as a positive, with some citing her lawyerly questioning of Trump officials and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as a key part of their support. But they had also heard rumblings of criticism surrounding her record from the left, which has raised concerns that Harris was too cautious about backing progressive reforms on issues like sentencing, the death penalty and police brutality.

Marques Milbourne, 35, called Harris ""by far the best candidate"" and his top choice for president as he and his wife waited outside. But he wanted to learn more about her record on crime, some of which, Milbourne said, ""sounds concerning"" based on his conversations with friends.

""I like her law enforcement aspect,"" Rose Downes, 52, said after her town hall while wearing a ""Kamala Harris for President 2020"" shirt. ""I know it's not PC to say.""

What may distinguish Harris the most so far is her upbeat tone. Rivals like Warren and Sanders have taken a more adversarial approach, casting their campaigns as a crusade against wealthy elites who have manipulated government and rigged the system to boost profits at the expense of the working-and middle-class.

Harris, while not ignoring these ideas, has emphasized a more warm-and-fuzzy togetherness rather than a call to arms.

""We are an aspirational nation,"" she said. ""We've not quite met those ideals, we know that, but our nature is to fight to achieve them and we cannot lose that aspirational nature of who we are, because that is part of our strength.""

At St. Anselm, she said she disagreed with the notion that ""people who have worked hard and gained success should be vilified.""

""I don't believe that, I applaud that, that's pursuit of the American Dream,"" she said, even as she added that not everyone has equal opportunity under the present system.

Harris did not mention President Donald Trump often, but did throw some punches over the recent government shutdown and she called the wall one of his ""vanity projects.""

""You talk with the people who take an oath to protect our border and they will tell you that trafficking that is happening of drugs and guns coming into our country, it's happening at ports of entry,"" she said. ""We don't need a multibillion-dollar wall. That wall ain't gonna stop them."""

I never heard of Jussie Smollett or even the Fox TV show “Empire” until the alleged hate crime was reported to the police and the media by the actor himself.

By now most everyone knows what was reported, Smollett told authorities he was attacked early Jan. 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.”

There are now reports that Smollett may have paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month. Those two men were Nigerian brothers, one of whom he knew and appeared on his TV show, Empire. The brothers are reporting they were paid $3,500 to stage the attack.

I knew as soon as I read this story the first time it was a hoax. The liberal media wanted so badly to believe it was true so they could further divide and push their agenda.

Donald Trump once said, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity!” It’s somewhat ironic that Jussie is following in the footsteps of his nemesis and adversary and seeming to be using him more as a mentor.

So much for Michelle Obama’s statement of “When they go low, we go high.”

This is how a failing actor who is written off a TV show gains international attention.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett and that, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people that he is OK and thanking them for their support. He says he is working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California , opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” They question them about the case. Police also search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he says.

Feb. 19

— Chicago police say they’re investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

The announcement came shortly after Chicago police said he was now considered a “suspect” in their criminal investigation.

Jussie Smollett should know that as many as a dozen Chicago detectives have been working his case when they might otherwise have been working murders such as last summer's killing of 21-year-old Oceanea Jones.

That homicide remains unsolved. The murdered woman's mother regularly calls the lone detective who is presently handling the case.

“I called last week,” the mother, Kenyatta Jones, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “Same thing. They still don't have anybody in custody.”

Back on the night of July 30, four young men approached Oceanea as she walked with her boyfriend.They may have mistakenly decided the boyfriend was a member of a rival gang. Jones ran and was shot in the back as she cried out a single word.

“No!”

Over the months since then, the mother has been making fortnightly trips by city bus to her daughter's grave at Oak Wood Cemetery. There, she repeats a promise.

“I tell her I’m going to get justice for her,” Kenyatta Jones says. “I tell her, ‘Mamma ain’t going to stop working this case.’”

The mother described what appears to be the manpower devoted to solving the killing.

“One detective.”

And she figures that the detective must already be overburdened with other cases.

“I think it's too much to do,” the mother said. “Every time there’s a murder, they’re out at the scene.”

She cannot help but take particular note of news reports regarding the resources the Chicago PD has been dedicating to the Smollett investigation.

“There are so many unsolved murders in Chicago,” she said.

But she understands this is how a police department is liable to respond when a celebrity claims to have been a victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

“It’s what everybody is talking about,” she said.

A hate letter laced with white powder that proved to be ground-up Tylenol did not generate much attention. But the assault that Smollett says followed it sure did.

And the detectives were faced with a huge amount of work. They had to canvass the area for witnesses. They had to locate every possible surveillance camera in the area and view the footage. They then had to track down two figures captured on video and identify them as brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

The men proved to have departed for their native Nigeria, and the detectives had to be at the airport to detain them when they returned. The detectives then had to question the two until they were satisfied the men had not committed an actual assault.

On top of that, the detectives had to obtain and execute search warrants. They also set to work tracing the rope Smollett said had been placed around his neck. They succeeded in tracing it to an Ace Hardware store.

Of course, the detectives had to brief their supervisors and prepare reports, documenting each step they made. That included chasing down the many tips invariably prompted by a high-profile case.

On Tuesday, a tip came in that Smollett had been seen in his apartment building elevator with the Osundairo brothers. Detectives had to go out and view even more video before they concluded that the tipster was mistaken.

Other detectives were busy nailing down a case made considerably more difficult and detective-intensive as it looked ever less like what it was initially reported to be.

“Lot of little tedious things,” a law enforcement official told The Daily Beast.

The official added, “You kind of have to take everything at face value with a hate crime. A particularly hateful hate crime at that.”

Also on Monday came a report that Smollett had hired a third lawyer, Mark Garagos. The police will likely wait a few more days for Smollett and his legal team to decide whether to come in voluntarily and offer an explanation of the discrepancies between his initial account and what the detectives have since determined.

Even if the police decide Smollett made a false report, he is likely to be charged with a relatively minor offense. The only serious trouble may come if the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspectors decide he sent the hate letter, which might constitute a terroristic hoax.

But from the police point of view, there is no pressing need to rush out and arrest him.

“It's not like he killed somebody,” the law enforcement official said.

If Smollett did file a false report, however, what he also did was cause as many as a dozen detectives to be diverted from seeking out people who actually killed somebody. This at a time when the Chicago police report they are making real progress in reducing the violence that earned the city the nickname Chiraq.

Meanwhile, Kenyatta Jones reports that she informed the detective on her daughter’s case that she has decided she cannot just sit and wait for answers.

“I told [the detective] I’ve been doing my own little investigating myself,” the mother said.

She added, “I’m doing OK. I’m getting a couple of names.”

She hopes to determine exactly why those four young men went after Oceanea and her boyfriend.

“Nobody I know why,” the mother said.

She is determined not to stop until she has fulfilled the promise of justice that she repeated when making her latest fortnightly visit to her daughter's grave.

That was on Thursday. A winter storm had passed through, and she cleared the snow from the headstone. She left some of it by the grave itself.

“I kept a little snow around her,” the mother said. “She liked snow. She liked to make snowballs.”"

Chicago police now believe he paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on January 29 in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

Investigators are also probing whether he penned a letter sent to the studio where Empire was filmed a week before the attack which contained a death threat.

The letter was addressed to Smollett and had 'MAGA' written across the front, and inside contained cut-out magazine text which reads 'you will die black f*g'.

The letter also contained a white powder that turned out to be crushed aspirin, and a drawing of a man with a gun pointed at his head.

It has been speculated that Smollett planned the assault when the letter failed to get the attention he was seeking.

Smollett has vehemently denied claims he fabricated the attack through his lawyers.

A swarm of celebrity and political figures - including the likes of Cardi B and Nany Pelosi - have been forced to walk back their initial condemnation of the attack after the police counter-narrative emerged.

Meanwhile McCabe appeared on CNN Tuesday night where Anderson Cooper posed the question: 'Do you still believe the President could be a Russian asset?'

Conway also set her sights on Andrew McCabe after he told CNN that 'it's possible' Trump was acting as an asset for Russia, saying 'he lies under oath so he sure as hell lies when he's not'

McCabe, who served as acting FBI director after Trump sacked James Comey, has used his book tour to attack the President over his links to Russia

McCabe replied: 'I think it's possible. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where (special counsel Robert) Mueller concludes that.'

He added: 'This President is undermining the role of law enforcement, undermining the role of our intelligence infrastructure and negatively impacting the men and women of the FBI, and across the intelligence agencies, (and their) ability to protect this country on a daily basis.'

Earlier on Tuesday, McCabe said that federal law enforcement thought it was possible Donald Trump was working on behalf of Russia when the Bureau opened its counterintelligence investigation into him in 2016.

'We had information that led us to believe that there might be a threat to national security – in this case that the president himself might, in fact, be a threat to the United States national security,' he said in a 'Today' show interview.

As his explosive memoir went on sale, McCabe declared that 'we thought it might be possible' that Trump was directly working on behalf of Russia during the early days of his administration.

McCabe was fired last year by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who cited his 'lack of candor' during an internal investigation into media leaks about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails."

‘His Hat and His Teeth’

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont begins his campaign for president with a few advantages: Having run in 2016, he already has widespread name recognition and a broad base of supporters and donors. Meanwhile, comics looking to make fun of him also have a head start.

Sanders announced on Tuesday that he was running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and the late-night TV hosts were ready with a familiar litany of Sanders tropes. Jimmy Fallon told jokes about his age, his disdain for the wealthy and the volume of his voice."

For nine days, with a nationwide search underway, she made tearful pleas on television for their safe return. “I wanna say to my babies,” she sobbed with her distraught husband by her side, “your mama loves you so much.” Finally her story unraveled and she confessed to intentionally sending her Mazda into a nearby lake with her two young sons strapped inside.

Apart from the unconscionable drowning of her own helpless children, Susan Smith’s story contained a racial dimension that tore at the nation’s social fabric: her false accusation that a black man had victimized a young white mother and murdered her innocent babies. It was an ugly but shrewd lie that exploited bigotry for sympathy in order to conceal her own evil.

On January 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett, a 36-year-old, gay black actor on the Fox drama series Empire, told police he had been assaulted outside his apartment building at 2 a.m. on a snowy Chicago night by two men in ski masks who identified him as the Empire actor, hurled racial and anti-gay slurs at him, draped a makeshift noose around his neck, and tossed some bleach on him before disappearing. TMZ reported that sources claimed the attackers had boasted to Smollett, “This is MAGA country”; he confirmed this in a follow-up interview with the police.

The story instantly made big news, but anyone not consumed by hatred for President Trump and his supporters immediately suspected a hoax because Smollett’s narrative lacked any credibility whatsoever. A pair of Trump supporters were walking the icy streets of Chicago at 2 a.m. with a noose and bleach (which inexplicably did not freeze in the literally sub-zero weather) when they recognized a little-known (to anyone but Empire fans) actor from a TV show no white supremacist would watch, assaulted him without causing any more physical damage than a scratch on his cheek but managed to get a noose around his neck, and then made sure to announce that “This is MAGA country”? Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Chicago is “Make America Great Again” country? Who knew?

But Democrat politicians and celebrities predictably leapt to Smollett’s defense and denounced the Trump-inspired white supremacism that clearly was the culprit. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both 2020 presidential hopefuls who have taken the art of grandstanding to a stratospheric level, described the attack as a modern-day lynching. Booker wasted no time pushing Congress to pass the federal Anti-Lynching Bill he and Harris co-sponsored (because apparently our porous border isn’t a national emergency, but lynching is).

Rep. Maxine Waters took a quick break from chanting “Impeach Trump!” to blame him for “emboldening” racists. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the incident undeniably a racist, homophobic attack that reflected “what is happening to our country.” Her Congressional colleague Rashida Tlaib tweeted hyperbolically that “the lies of the right wing is [sic] killing and hurting our people.” Yet another 2020 Democrat hopeful, Joe Biden, pontificated that “racism and homophobia have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another noted pontificator, called the attack an “affront to our humanity.”*

The Progressive media, also predictably, rushed to judgment as well because that’s what they do when they see an opportunity to demonize Trump and/or his supporters (recall the hysterics over the Covington Catholic high school students?). ABC’s Good Morning America granted Smollett the kind of lengthy sit-down interview usually reserved for presidents (more on that below). Joshua Rivera at GQ, ostensibly a men’s style magazine but actually a leftist propaganda rag, race-baited that “Whiteness in 21st century America has an endgame,” and that Smollett’s attack proved “racist homophobes are stalking the streets of your city, who want you to know that they could lynch you if they really wanted to, and maybe get away with it too.”

Kevin Fallon, a senior entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast, tweeted, “People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that ‘faggot’ from Empire. Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.” In light of new developments, it looks like Fallon is the one who needs to take a hard look in the mirror – but he won’t. Neither will Rivera or ABC or anyone else who wasted no time slamming white conservatives.

Hollywood leftists, of course, had to chime in because they’re all virtue-signaling posturers who live in walled estates and travel with armed bodyguards. Jussie’s co-star Grace Byers wrote that “hatred, inequality, racism and discrimination continue to course through our country’s veins.” Actor Nico Tortorella said the “red hat is the white hood. No ifs ands or buts. If you wear it, you attacked Jussie.” Another purported entertainer who is light-years away from being a household name, Billy Eichner, tweeted, “I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell.” The insufferable, anti-Christian bigot/actress Ellen Page declared tearfully on Stephen Colbert’s late night talk show that Vice President Mike Pence was somehow to blame. And on and on. Too many celebrities-in-their-own-minds to count.

Smollett, who is also a singer, put on a show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles only a few nights after the incident, where he greeted the crowd by saying he felt compelled to perform because he refused to “let the m*th*rf*ck*ers win.” So brave. The crowd roared in support.

He went on to participate in a (seemingly) emotional Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts, who asked why he thought he was targeted. Smollett replied, “I come really, really hard against 45 [President Trump]. I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.” Except when it comes to telling the truth, apparently. He also expressed frustration at not being believed. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” he told Roberts. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Production sources told tmz.com that Smollet's five scenes have been cut in the second to last episode of the show.

Smollet was supposed to have nine scenes but now he will have only four scenes. And there will be no proper focus on Smollet in the remaining scenes. The scenes will feature an ensemble cast.

Due to Smollet's case, the script has also undergone multiple revisions.

Last month, Smollet reported to police that he was attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and physically beat him.

Following an investigation, two brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo were arrested by the police who viewed them as ""potential suspects"", but they were released later due to lack of evidence. It was later reported that Smollet had staged the attack.

Smollet's case will now be presented before the grand jury.

The ball is in Jussie Smollett's court, and we're told the ONLY way he can stave off a grand jury investigation is to meet with cops and somehow convince them the ""attack"" was real.

As we reported, police ""urgently"" want a follow-up interview with Jussie ... this comes after Ola and Abel Osundairo told police they staged the so-called attack at Jussie's behest and even got paid for doing so.

We're told the call has gone out to his lawyers, but cops have not heard back. It's now complicated by the fact there are rumblings Jussie has a new lawyer -- Mark Geragos.

Our sources say cops are waiting to see if Geragos makes contact with them. Our sources say if Jussie refuses to speak with police -- which is almost a certainty -- the case will go directly to the grand jury.

Even if Jussie speaks to police, unless he pulls a rabbit out of a hat and convinces them the ""attack"" was real, the case is still going to the grand jury.

Our law enforcement sources say the grand jury will decide whether to indict Jussie on the felony crime of filing a false police report."

After Noah noted that police seized several items involved in the attack from the home of two former suspects, one of whom was Smollett's trainer on a music video, and that policemen are now investigating whether Smollett was involved, Young-White told the audience, ""I'm not surprised but I'm disappointed.""

He added, ""This story has been weird for me, Trevor. As a gay person, I'm used to speaking on gay issues. As a black person, I'm used to speaking on black issues.

He joked that he belonged to a third community ""devastated"" by the turn in reports on the attack: the actor community. He added that he looks like Smollett, which Noah pushed back against. ""To white people I do,"" Young-White said. ""And hopefully, to anyone who's casting the Jussie Smollett Lifetime movie.""

Young-White added that the plot to the alleged attack was Lifetime-like, given that it hinged on Trump supporters who watch Empire and a death threat made out of magazine clippings. ""That's so dated, you know? Everyone knows if you're sending a death threat, you send that shit on Twitter,"" Young-White joked.

On Tuesday, Chicago police confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that they were investigating a tip that Smollett had been seen with the two former suspects hours before the alleged assault. Later that day Chicago PD chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi said the tip was ""unfounded,"" tweeting: ""CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.""

On Tuesday (Feb. 19), Chicago police confirmed they received a new tip in the ongoing investigation on the attack of Jussie Smollett. The Chicago Sun-Times reported police indicated Smollett may have been spotted in his building’s elevator with the two alleged attackers, brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo. Authorities have now told reporters that the tip is “unfounded.”

CPD: The 2 brothers who were previously considered suspects in the Jussie Smollett case met with police and prosecutors at 26th/Cal today, though did not testify before a grand jury. Also, the tip that Smollett was seen with them the day of the reported attack was deemed bogus. — Sam Charles (@samjcharles) February 19, 2019

See the original story below.

Chicago police now believe the actor staged his own attack.

Chicago police are following up on a tip that Jussie Smollett was seen in an elevator with the two men previously arrested in connection with the attack that happened against the actor last month.

READ: Report: Chicago Police Claim Jussie Smollett Staged His Own Attack

According to a report from the Chicago Sun-Times, the tipster — presumed to be a resident or visitor in Smollett’s apartment building — said they saw the three men together the same night that the actor reported being attacked. The validity of the tip has yet to be confirmed, with investigators planning on interviewing the person Tuesday.

Police had previously disputed that the attack against Smollett was a hoax but now believe he staged it after speaking with two brothers that claim Smollett hired them for the attack.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were brought in on Wednesday as the lead suspects in the incident. After a round of interviewing and the threat of being charged with battery, the Osundairo brothers claimed that Smollet hired them to participate in the staged attack, paying them $4,000 for their assistance. They went on to paint a drastically differed picture of the incident, claiming to have bought the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a local hardware store and the red imitation MAGA hats at a beauty supply. They even rehearsed the attack a few days prior.

As a result of the scandal, his role in Empire as Jamal Lyon has reportedly been reduced.

Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to last episode but five of those scenes, as well as the musical number, have been cut. The episode is currently being shot.

The report continues: “As for the remaining 4 scenes…we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.”

The “Empire” actor claimed that when he was walking home at 2 a.m. in Chicago, in the midst of the polar vortex, he was accosted by two assailants, both of whom shouted anti-gay and anti-black slurs at him.

They then attempted to throw a noose around his neck and pour what he thought was bleach on him while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” he says.

None of this is true. Police now think that Smollett paid two of his friends to stage the entire attack.

Why, exactly, would Smollett do it? He is a successful actor on a hit television show. He’s been continuously working in Hollywood for years, with roles in the 2017 films “Marshall” and “Alien: Covenant.”

He’s not exactly a textbook victim.

The answer to this question makes for some uncomfortable lessons.

First, alleged victims sometimes have an incentive to lie. For several years, each time an alleged victim tells an unverified and unverifiable story, we are told that we must believe that victim’s story. Why? Because, why would the victim lie? But this is often untrue.

Smollett had an incentive to lie: unending media attention, fawning sycophancy from politicians, and the potential for even greater Hollywood stardom.

If Smollett had gotten away with his hoax, he’d be the face of gay, black suffering in the United States.

Few had heard of Smollett before this story. Suddenly, he found himself on “Good Morning America,” telling the world about his own bravery. That’s a lucrative career path.

Second, hoaxers can read the tea leaves. There’s a reason that the most prominent racial and sexual hoaxes have generally flattered the political sensibilities of the political left. Right-wing hoaxes might catch the attention of right-wing sources, but left-wing sources are far more powerful and plentiful.

Imagine if a MAGA-hatted young Republican had accused two young black men of assaulting him while shouting, “F— Trump!” That story might get play on talk radio and Fox News, but it wouldn’t earn one iota of attention from celebrity culture or the mainstream media.

Third, social media make hoaxes infinitely easier. There are large-scale incentives for jumping on every story before the facts are clear, which is why Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., both running for president, tweeted their support for Smollett … and then had to backtrack radically, suggesting as the hoax emerged that they had to wait for more facts.

Being the first to rip America bears political fruit; waiting for the whole story often earns public castigation for insufficient sensitivity.

All of this means that the hoaxes won’t stop anytime soon. The incentives simply aren’t aligned for hoaxes to end. Media members are too eager to buy into stories that support their preferred narratives; social media are too eager to engage in pile-ons of epic proportions; hoaxers are obviously eager to make a buck or win some fame.

That means that we should all wait next time we hear a story too good to be true.

But we won’t. Nobody knows who the next Jussie Smollett will be. But within a few weeks, we’ll surely know.

Smollett says he was attacked by two individuals on January 29. The openly gay actor claims the attackers made racist and homophobic comments, beat him up, poured a chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

The FBI is working with the US Postal Service to look into whether ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was involved in a threatening letter he recieved on January 22, sources told ABC News.

A letter containing racist and homophobic threats and a white powder that was determined to be aspirin was addressed to Smollett at the Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Two federal officials told ABC News they are looking into whether Smollett played a role in the sending of that letter. INSIDER contacted both the FBI and USPS for confirmation and did not hear back prior to publication.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two individuals on January 29. The openly gay actor claims that the attackers made racist and homophobic comments, beat him up, poured a chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

There was no security footage of the attack, but cameras did catch two individuals near the location of the alleged attack.

Last Wednesday, the Chicago Police Department took two brothers, who have been identified by news organizations as Olabinjo Osundario and Abimbola Osundairo, into custody. The Osundario brothers were questioned, but not charged and were released on Friday. According to CNN, they are cooperating with the investigation.

On Thursday, February 14, officials with the Chicago Police Department said they didn't have reason to believe Smollett orchestrated the attack.

However, by Friday afternoon the department said that the investigation had ""shifted,"" and on Saturday, two law-enforcement sources told CNN that CPD believed Smollett may have staged the attack and paid the two brothers.

In a statement to INSIDER on Tuesday, the CPD confirmed that information from the persons questioned had changed its trajectory, and the department hopes to speak to Smollett's attorneys for another interview.

On Saturday, Smollett's attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement to CNN in response to reports that he staged the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement to CNN read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

INSIDER contacted Smollett's representative and his legal team for comment. We will update as necessary.

Smollett was reportedly cut from some ""Empire"" scenes this week while the investigation continues."

Tuesday night, he brought in reinforcements.

Jaboukie Young-White, the 24-year-old comedian who came on board as a correspondent on the show last October, was able to speak to this story from a distinct perspective. Like Smollett, he is both black and gay.

“This story has been weird for me, Trevor,” he began. “As a gay person, I’m used to speaking on gay issues. As a black person, I’m used to speaking on black issues. But I’m not used to them intercepting.” The only other scenario he could imagine is if RuPaul robbed a bank.

“And I’m also part of a third community that’s been devastated by this: the actor community, Trevor,” he said. “Because of Jussie, everyone will think actors are liars now, because that’s our job, which is true. But on top of that, I look like him.” When Noah protested, he added, “To white people, I do.”

As for why Smollett would apparently stage an attack on himself, Young-White said, “If he wanted to raise awareness for LGBTQ rights, he should have just donated money. If he wanted attention, he should have just leaked his nudes. And if he wanted to hang out with two guys at 2 a.m., Grindr is right there.”

And when Noah asked if this will harm “real victims” of hate crimes, the correspondent said, “Not really. Because that would have required people to care about queer people—specifically queer black people, in the first place.” He cited the very real “gay and trans panic defense,” which allows defendants in 47 states across the country to get lighter sentences if they claim their victim was trying to hit on them.

“In 47 states, including New York, someone could beat a gay person like me to death,” he explained, “and then go, ‘Well, I don’t know, he wanted to suck my dick.’ And you know what, maybe I did. But that’s still not a good reason. I mean, imagine if women could use that defense, there would be no men left. None!”

“Honestly, Trevor, I think this is a teaching moment for us all and personally I’ve learned one really valuable lesson, which is that actors should not write their own projects!” Young-White concluded. “I mean, this thing had way too many plot holes. He totally miscast the villains. Two Nigerian Trump supporters? Like, you can’t just cast black people as racist white people. This isn’t Hamilton!”"

Stargazers across the United States were treated to a stunning 'super snow moon' on Tuesday night.

The name for the February supermoon comes from the fact that it often coincides with heavy snowfall around this time of year, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.

The lunar marvel was a two-day event that started on February 18 and was the largest and brightest full moon of 2019 due to the almost exact overlap of the moon's perigee - its closest point to Earth - and when it is at its fullest in the 28-day lunar cycle.

The point of true perigee is only six hours away from perfectly coinciding with the fullest version of the moon, meaning it appears up to 14 per cent larger and 30 per cent brighter than normal.

After setting on Tuesday morning from its debut Monday night, the snow super moon became viewable again on Tuesday night at the time of moon rise in each state across the US, which was first at 5.33pm Eastern in Providence, Rhode Island and last at 7.50pm Hawaiian-Aleutian Standard Time in Alaska.

It was officially full at 10.53am Eastern, but the sun was above the horizon for most, meaning the fleeting moment was missed.

'The February 2019 supermoon is special because it will be the largest full moon gracing our night skies until 2026,' said Emily Drabek-Maunder, astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich.

'This is because the moment the Moon is at its fullest phase is closer to the time the Moon is at perigee. Tonight, the Moon may seem brighter and will be up to 14 per cent larger than when the Moon is at apogee, or furthest away from Earth in its orbit.'

The supermoon rose first in the US at 5.33pm Eastern in Providence, Rhode Island, followed by 5.46pm Eastern in New York, 5.43pm Central in Lutsen, Minnesota, 5.46pm Pacific in Las Vegas, 6.02pm Pacific in Los Angeles, and last at 7.50pm Hawaiian-Aleutian in Amatignak Island, Alaska.

It's the second of three supermoons to light up the skies this year, following the Super Blood Wolf Moon that took place on January 21 and preceding yet another on March 21.

The spectacular lunar display is known as the 'snow moon' because it often appears along with heavy snowfall around this time of year, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.

The moon was 221,734 miles from Earth, according to EarthSky, when it hit its perigee - the closest point to Earth in its orbit.

Those looking to photograph the phenomenon will be best served shortly after moonrise - when the moon is close to the horizon and remnant light from the sun remains to illuminate the foreground.

A supermoon is a phenomena that occurs when the moon's orbit is closest to Earth making it appear full, bright, and larger than life.

'When a full moon appears at perigee [its closest point to Earth] it is slightly brighter and larger than a regular full moon—and that's where we get a ""supermoon,'""' NASA explains on their website.

It appeared especially large just as it rose above the horizon thanks to 'moon illusion,' which is a phenomenon where the brain thinks the moon is bigger than it really is given the moon's location.

Although this moon was closer to earth than the last, it was not be as colorful as the 'Super Blood Wolf Moon' eclipse that wowed the skies in January.

SAN DIEGO – I have a confession. I filed this column late – about 20 years late. My brother, a Los Angeles-based marketing specialist who came out as gay two decades ago, often urges me to write more about the LGBTQ community. I’m missing a big story, he says.

But, I tell him, I need a news peg. Now, suddenly, I have my pick. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the uprising in New York’s Greenwich Village in June 1969 credited with sparking the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. It also seems we’re living through an LGBTQ moment.

• Last week, Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” addressed doubts about his claim that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. Smollett says that two men yelled slurs, hit him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” In an emotional interview Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” the actor called “ridiculous” the idea that he would lie about such a thing, as some have alleged.

Since the interview aired, police have interviewed two brothers from Nigeria who say Smollett hired them to stage the attack. Smollett and his attorneys vehemently deny that. Stay tuned.

• A few days after the alleged assault on Smollett, during an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” actress Ellen Page launched her own attack. Page, who is married to a woman, took aim at Vice President Mike Pence. Page said Pence tried to ban same-sex marriage when he was Indiana governor, and said the vice president believes in conversion therapy. She accused Pence of “hating” LGBTQ people and wanting “to cause suffering.” She blamed the vice president for the alleged attack on Smollett and other assaults against LGBTQ folks. “This needs to (expletive) stop!” Page said to rousing applause.

• Then Page slammed actor Chris Pratt after the star of “Guardians of the Galaxy” – during an appearance of his own on Colbert’s show – discussed his church. In a tweet, Page called Pratt’s house of faith – Hillsong Church – “infamously anti-LGBTQ.” According to Variety, in 2015, church executives drew criticism for calling homosexuality a sin. Pratt rejected Page’s accusation and fired back on Instagram, saying that “nothing could be further from the truth.” His church, he claims, “opens their doors to absolutely everyone … regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender.”

• In Texas, a gay couple was brutally beaten Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime committed by four men who have since been arrested. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were holding hands as they left a gay club in downtown Austin when they heard a man shout a homophobic slur. More obscenities followed, as the man motioned for the others to join him. One of the men punched Perry to the ground, and Deehring was also attacked when he tried to defend Perry, according to the report. … Deehring suffered cuts and a minor concussion while Perry had a major concussion, internal bleeding and a broken nose.

• Finally, just this past week, in San Diego, in what authorities are calling a hate crime, a gunman opened fire in the Hillcrest neighborhood, which is considered the epicenter of the city’s LGBTQ community. Armed with a high-powered AR-15 rifle, Stefano Parker allegedly shot 19 rounds through the window of restaurant after posting an anti-LGBTQ comment on Facebook. There were nine people in the establishment, but no one was hurt. Parker was charged with nine counts of attempted murder.

Just curious. What decade is this? I’m asking for friends and family. The conventional thinking is – with millions of dollars in AIDS funding, the Supreme Court striking down laws banning gay marriage, and scores of LGBTQ characters and storylines on film and television – all battles have been fought and won.

Not even close. Members of that community say they fear a rollback of hard-earned rights, privileges and protections, and that they’ll force the issue in the 2020 presidential election. This is the conversation America needs to have. …"

Smollett, 36, a gay African American actor who appears on TV drama Empire, told police he was attacked on January 29 by two masked men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett, the men struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an unknown chemical substance before fleeing.

But the actor now appears to be under investigation himself, amid claims he staged the incident because he feared he was about to be written out of the popular television show.

Police say the focus of their investigation has shifted after they received new information about the attack from the alleged assailants.

Police detained two Nigerian brothers, identified as Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo last week, who were recognised from surveillance footage taken in the area of the alleged assault.

One of the brothers had appeared as an extra on Empire and the other was Smollett’s personal trainer.

Detectives released the brothers last week without charges citing new evidence that had emerged while they were being questioned.

Chicago police spokesperson, Anthony Guglielm, said the force had contacted Smollett’s lawyer to request another interview with the actor.

Last night, a spokesperson for Smollett said there were no plans for the actor to meet with Chicago detectives for a follow-up interview but his lawyers would keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.

TV station CBS 2 News reported that sources connected to the investigation believe Smollett paid the two men $3,500 (R49,600) to stage the attack, directing them to buy the rope used in the incident and rehearsing it with them days before.

CNN reported that police sources believed the attack had been coordinated.

It said records found in the brothers’ home showed they had purchased the rope at a store in Chicago.

The actor’s representatives have strongly refuted the claims, saying Smollett felt victimised by suggestions he played a role in the assault on him.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which broadcasts Empire, backed the actor, insisting he is a core character and dismissing claims he was to be written off."

The rapper went live on Instagram on Monday (per Uproxx and accused Smollett of “f**k[ing] up Black History Month” with his allegedly staged attack.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f**k his name is,” Cardi said. “I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro. Damn.”

She did note that she is keeping an open mind, saying, “Until he says out his mouth that it was fake and this sh*t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him. Because somebody I was talking to said police in Chicago are racists, so they might try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro, you f**ked up for real.”

She’s not wrong, assuming he’s done what he is being accused of. Smollett is conceivably facing a possible felony indictment on charges of filing a false police report."

It would be recalled we reported earlier that the case took a new twist after evidence suggested that Smollett may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack.

Reacting to this development, Noah stated that there are portions of Jussie Smollet's narration which look fishy. He asked,

""Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch 'Empire'?""

Noah went on,

""I've heard of hate-watching but that shit would be next-level. That's like a member of the Klan buying tickets to 'Fiddler on the Roof.'""

Sharing a picture of the Nigerian brothers who look ripped, Noah continued,

""I'm not gonna lie, that's the one part of the story that actually makes sense to me because if I was paying these two to beat me up, I would want to practice too. How many abs does this guy on the left have? It looks like he stole a couple of abs from the other guy. So in the public eye, this story has moved from a hate crime against a popular TV actor to a giant hoax by a popular TV actor, but Smollett still insists there was 'no collusion.'""

Further reacting to an interview on ""Good Morning America"" show which saw Smollet burst into tears while narrating the ordeal, Noah said he deserves an Oscar if the whole case turns out he was lying.

""Either this guy's telling the truth, or he deserves an Emmy for that interview because if all of that is just a performance, I don't care what he's lying about, you can't cancel him. He's just too good to not be on TV.""

It would be recalled Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B also slammed Smollett when she said he ruined Black History Month if it turns out he is lying about the attack."

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

This version of the story corrects the 4th paragraph to say that last week police said reports the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed. Corrects earlier version saying that police had declined to comment on whether it was a hoax.

Ego, publicity at stake when stars and TV critics meet

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Jerrod Carmichael, lamenting what he called the “terrible” state of TV comedy, asked his audience if they’d seen some of it. Staring back at the comedian was a hotel ballroom filled with journalists whose job it is to cover television.

“I think they see all of it,” helpfully offered Ramy Youssef, his fellow producer and star of their new Hulu sitcom.

“Poor y’all,” Carmichael said, a sympathetic coda to a semiannual event in which broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming platforms parade the shows and stars they hope will get attention from the 250 members of the Television Critics Association and, in turn, viewers.

The group, TCA for short, has been meeting twice a year, winter and summer, since it was founded in 1978. TV producers, actors and sometimes executives trek to a hotel — or more accurately, limo there, and mostly within upscale L.A.-adjacent areas — to answer questions about their shows and mingle with reporters at cocktail parties for more questions.

The stars are easy to spot: they’re well-dressed. Reporters, not so much, but they have the upper hand and a microphone during the Q&A sessions that are the core of the roughly two-week-long event. Adherence to the journalistic maxim of “no cheering in the press box” means celebrities face the unnerving sound of silence as they step out on an ad hoc stage.

‘Empire’ actor charged with making false police report

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said prosecutors charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring one to three years in prison and force the actor to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

Authorities were trying to get in touch with Smollett’s attorneys to “negotiate a reasonable surrender,” Guglielmi said. That could involve the actor, who is black and gay, turning himself in to a Chicago police station.

Police did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.

“We are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we’re hoping he does the same,” Guglielmi said.

Democrats’ resolution against Trump emergency coming Friday

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats will file a resolution Friday aimed at blocking the national emergency declaration that President Donald Trump has issued to help finance his wall along the Southwest border, teeing up a clash over billions of dollars, immigration policy and the Constitution’s separation of powers.

Though the effort seems almost certain to ultimately fall short — perhaps to a Trump veto — the votes will let Democrats take a defiant stance against Trump that is sure to please liberal voters. They will also put some Republicans from swing districts and states in a difficult spot.

Formally introducing the measure sets up a vote by the full House likely by mid-March, perhaps as soon as next week, because of a timeline spelled out by law. Initial passage by the Democratic-run House seems assured.

The measure would then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval. The law that spells out the rules for emergency declarations seems to require the Senate to address the issue too, but there’s never been a congressional effort to block one and some procedural uncertainties remain.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., seemed to predict approval, telling colleagues in a letter that her chamber will “move swiftly” to pass it and “the resolution will be referred to the Senate and then sent to the President’s desk.”

Feds: Coast Guard lieutenant compiled hit list of lawmakers

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Coast Guard lieutenant who was arrested last week is a “domestic terrorist” who drafted an email discussing biological attacks and had what appeared to be a hit list that included prominent Democrats and media figures, prosecutors said in court papers.

Christopher Paul Hasson is due to appear Thursday in federal court in Maryland after his arrest on gun and drug offenses, but prosecutors say those charges are the “proverbial tip of the iceberg.”

“The defendant is a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct,” prosecutors wrote in court papers .

Hasson, who works at the Coast Guard’s headquarters in Washington, has espoused extremist views for years, according to prosecutors. Court papers detail a June 2017 draft email in which Hasson wrote that he was “dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth,” and pondering how he might be able to acquire anthrax and toxins to create botulism or a deadly influenza.

In the same email, Hasson described an “interesting idea” that included “biological attacks followed by attack on food supply” as well as a bombing and sniper attacks, according to court documents filed by prosecutors.

US: Alabama woman who joined Islamic State is not a citizen

WASHINGTON (AP) — An Alabama woman who joined the Islamic State group in Syria won’t be allowed to return to the United States with her toddler son because she is not an American citizen, the U.S. said Wednesday. Her lawyer is challenging that claim.

In a brief statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave no details as to how the administration made their determination.

“Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States,” he said. “She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport nor any visa to travel to the United States.”

But Hassan Shibly, a lawyer for the woman, insisted Muthana was born in the United States and had a valid passport before she joined the Islamic State in 2014. He says she has renounced the terrorist group and wants to come home to protect her 18-month-old son regardless of the legal consequences.

“She’s an American. Americans break the law,” said Shibly, a lawyer with the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “When people break the law, we have a legal system to handle those kinds of situations to hold people accountable, and that’s all she’s asking for.”

Fire in old part of Bangladesh’s capital kills at least 69

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A devastating fire raced through buildings in an old part of Bangladesh’s capital and killed at least 69 people, officials and witnesses said Thursday.

About 50 other people were injured and the fire in Dhaka was mostly under control after more than nine hours of frantic efforts by firefighters.

The Chawkbazar area where the fire was burning is crammed with buildings separated by narrow alleys. The neighborhood is a mix of residential and commercial, with buildings that commonly have shops, restaurants or warehouses on the ground floors.

The blaze started late Wednesday night in one building but quickly spread to others, fire department Director General Brig. Gen. Ali Ahmed said.

The death toll rose to 69, with many of the victims trapped inside the buildings, said Mahfuz Riben, a control room official of the Fire Service and Civil Defense in Dhaka.

Climate threat doubter is leading effort to advise Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is exploring the idea of forming a special committee to look at climate change and security risks, with the effort being coordinated by a 79-year-old physicist who rejects mainstream climate science.

A “discussion paper” obtained by The Associated Press asks federal officials from an array of government agencies to weigh in on a proposed executive order that President Donald Trump would sign establishing the “Presidential Committee on Climate Security.”

A memo to those federal officials asks them to direct any questions to William Happer, a member of Trump’s National Security Council and a well-known critic of mainstream climate science findings.

“Happer would be a fringe figure even for climate skeptics,” said retired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. David Titley, now a professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University.

Several climate scientists agreed with Titley, including Georgia Tech’s Kim Cobb, who said Happer’s “false, unscientific notions about climate change represent a danger to the American people.”

Authorities announce Houston officer case review, FBI probe

HOUSTON (AP) — Prosecutors will review more than 1,400 criminal cases that involved a Houston officer who the police chief has accused of lying in an affidavit justifying a drug raid on a home in which officers shot and killed two residents, authorities said Wednesday.

The FBI also announced that it is opening an investigation to determine whether any civil rights were violated as a result of the raid and shooting last month.

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference that he welcomed the FBI investigation “in the spirit of transparency.”

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said her office’s review will look at cases spanning decades that involved Officer Gerald Goines, a 30-year department veteran. Twenty-seven of those cases are active.

“Although the criminal investigation of Officer Goines is ongoing, we have an immediate ethical obligation to notify defendants and their lawyers in Goines’ other cases to give them an opportunity to independently review any potential defenses,” Ogg said in a statement.

Lawyers for El Chapo concerned by juror misconduct claims

NEW YORK (AP) — El Chapo’s lawyers raised concerns of potential juror misconduct and were reviewing their options Wednesday after a member of the jury at the Mexican drug lord’s trial told a news website that several jurors looked at media coverage of the case.

The juror told VICE News that at least five members of the jury at Joaquin Guzman’s trial followed news reports and Twitter feeds about the case, against a judge’s orders, and were aware of potentially prejudicial material that jurors weren’t supposed to see.

Guzman, 61, was convicted Feb. 12 on drug and conspiracy charges that could put him behind bars for the rest of his life. Jurors deliberated for six days after three months of testimony. He is set to be sentenced in June.

Guzman’s lawyer, Eduardo Balarezo, said the issues of potential juror misconduct raised in the VICE article “are deeply concerning and distressing.”

“The juror’s allegations of the jury’s repeated and widespread disregard and contempt for the Court’s instructions, if true, make it clear that Joaquin did not get a fair trial,” Balarezo said in a statement. “We will review all available options before deciding on a course of action.”

Samsung folding phone is different – but also almost $2,000

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Samsung unveiled a highly anticipated smartphone with a foldable screen in an attempt to break the innovation funk that has beset the smartphone market.

But it’s far from clear that consumers will embrace a device that retails for almost $2,000, or that it will provide the creative catalyst the smartphone market needs.

The Galaxy Fold, announced Wednesday in San Francisco, will sell for $1,980 when it is released April 26.

Consumers willing to pay that hefty price will get a device that can unfold like a wallet. It can work like a traditional smartphone with a 4.6 inch screen or morph into something more like a mini-tablet with a 7.3 inch screen.

When fully unfolded, the device will be able to simultaneously run three different apps on the screen. The Galaxy Fold will also boast six cameras: three in the back, two on the inside and one on the front.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK-THE LATEST

The Latest: Smollett’s lawyers vow ‘aggressive defense’

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say they will mount an “aggressive defense” of the “Empire” actor after he was charged with making a false report that he was attacked in Chicago last month.

Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson say in a statement: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence… “

It did not say where Smollett is and when he might turn himself in to police.

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting an attack on Jan. 29. The charge is a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of 1-3 years, but he could also receive probation.

TRUMP-BORDER SECURITY

House Dems readying bill to block Trump’s border emergency

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats plan to file a resolution as soon as Friday that’s aimed at blocking President Donald Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the Southwest border.

That could set up a vote by the full House by mid-March. The clash is over a declaration that Trump is using to try spending billions of dollars beyond what Congress has authorized to start building border barriers.

Passage by the Democratic-run House seems likely. The measure would then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval.

Trump has promised a veto, which would be difficult for Congress to override.

The plan was described by officials at three progressive groups who heard of them from congressional aides but were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly.

COAST GUARD LIEUTENANT-HIT LIST

Feds: Coast Guard lieutenant compiled hit list of lawmakers

WASHINGTON (AP) — Prosecutors say a Coast Guard lieutenant is a “domestic terrorist” who wrote about biological attacks and had a hit list that included prominent Democrats and media figures.

Christopher Paul Hasson is due in court on Thursday in Maryland. He was arrested on gun and drug charges last week.

Prosecutors say Hasson espoused extremist views for years. Court papers detail a June 2017 draft email in which Hasson described an “interesting idea” that included “biological attacks followed by attack on food supply.”

Federal agents found 15 firearms and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition when Hasson was arrested. Prosecutors say he also had compiled a list of prominent congressional Democrats, activists, journalists and media commentators.

Hasson’s attorney declined to comment on Wednesday. His arrest was first noted by researchers from George Washington University.

ISLAMIC STATE BRIDE-THE LATEST

The Latest: Lawyer says woman who joined IS a US citizen

WASHINGTON (AP) — The lawyer for an Alabama woman denied return to the U.S. after joining the Islamic State group in Syria says he has evidence she’s an American citizen.

U.S. officials contend that Hoda Muthana isn’t a citizen and has no legal basis to travel to the U.S.

President Donald Trump says he decided to deny her return and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agrees with that decision. Pompeo says Muthana isn’t a citizen and doesn’t have a valid passport.

Her lawyer, Hassan Shibly, released a copy of her birth certificate and a letter from a U.S. official indicating her father was no longer a diplomat when she was born in 1994. Shibly says Muthana had a valid U.S. passport before she joined the militant group in 2014.

BANGLADESH-FIRE

Fire in old part of Bangladesh’s capital kills at least 45

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A devastating fire has raced through at least five buildings in an old part of Bangladesh’s capital and killed at least 45 people.

About 50 other people have been injured and the fire in Dhaka is not yet under control.

The fire department’s Director General Brig. Gen. Ali Ahmed said early Thursday the blaze broke out in the Chawkbazar area Wednesday night in one building but quickly spread.

Ali said by early Thursday rescuers recovered at least 45 bodies as they were trying to get the blaze under control.

Some floors of the destroyed buildings had chemicals and plastic in storage.

HOUSTON OFFICERS SHOT

Officials announce Houston officer’s case review, FBI probe

HOUSTON (AP) — Prosecutors say they will review more than 1,400 criminal cases that involved a Houston officer who the police chief says lied in an affidavit justifying a drug raid on a home in which officers shot and killed two residents.

EL CHAPO-PROSECUTION

El Chapo’s lawyers concerned by juror misconduct allegations

NEW YORK (AP) — El Chapo’s lawyers are raising concerns of potential juror misconduct after a member of the jury told a news website that several jurors viewed media coverage of the Mexican drug lord’s trial against a judge’s orders.

VICE News published an interview Wednesday with a juror who said at least five other members at Joaquin Guzman’s trial had followed news coverage of the proceedings, including potentially prejudicial material made public before deliberations.

Defense attorney Eduardo Balarezo said the issues raised in the article “are deeply concerning and distressing” and, if true, “make it clear that Joaquin did not get a fair trial.”

Balarezo’s statement didn’t make clear whether Guzman’s lawyers would seek a new trial.

Guzman was convicted Feb. 12 on charges that could put him behind bars for decades.

Prosecutors declined comment.

SAMSUNG-NEW PHONES

Samsung poised to unveil new phones in bid to revive sales

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Samsung is expected to show off its latest smartphones Wednesday, the latest effort by a phone maker to come up with new features compelling enough to end a sales slump.

The new models expected in San Francisco will commemorate the 10th anniversary of Samsung’s first smartphone.

Samsung is also expected to provide a glimpse at a highly anticipated smartphone with a foldable screen.

Apple touted the iPhone’s 10th-anniversary edition as a breakthrough when it was released in late 2017. But the iPhone X didn’t sell as well as analysts hoped, partly because it carried a $1,000 price tag.

Smartphones made in recent years also haven’t made dramatic improvements from earlier models. The lull in innovation has given consumers little incentive to dump their current devices and buy something new.

PEOPLE-KHLOE KARDASHIAN

Khloe Kardashian bestie Malika Haqq fierce on cheating front

NEW YORK (AP) — Who’s the best wing woman on the planet? That would be Malika Haqq.

The Khloe Kardashian bestie has taken to social media amid rumors that Tristan Thompson has cheated again, this time reportedly making out at a Los Angeles house party last weekend with Jordyn Woods.

The 21-year-old Woods is Kardashian sister Kylie Jenner’s oldest and dearest friend who may or may not still live in Jenner’s mansion after Tuesday’s bombshell reports by the celebrity sites TMZ and Hollywood Unlocked, among others.

On Instagram, Haqq commented “STRONG FACTS” after the house-party session broke. Kardashian herself, or at least Kardashian’s verified Instagram account, posted a string of eight gossipy speaking head emojis soon after on the same thread, but actual Khloe has yet to comment.

On January 22, a letter containing racist and homophobic threats and a white powder that was determined to be aspirin was addressed to Smollett at the Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Smollett says he was attacked by two individuals on January 29. The openly gay actor claims the attackers made racist and homophobic comments, beat him up, poured a chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

In a statement to INSIDER, the Chicago Police Department confirmed that information from the persons questioned had changed their trajectory, and the department hopes to speak to Smollett's attorneys for another interview.

The FBI is working with the US Postal Service to look into whether ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was involved in a threatening letter he recieved on January 22, sources told ABC News.

A letter containing racist and homophobic threats and a white powder that was determined to be aspirin was addressed to Smollett at the Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where ""Empire"" is filmed.

Two federal officials told ABC News they are looking into whether Smollett played a role in the sending of that letter. INSIDER contacted both the FBI and USPS for confirmation and did not hear back prior to publication.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two individuals on January 29. The openly gay actor claims that the attackers made racist and homophobic comments, beat him up, poured a chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

There was no security footage of the attack, but cameras did catch two individuals near the location of the alleged attack.

Last Wednesday, the Chicago Police Department took two brothers, who have been identified by news organizations as Olabinjo Osundario and Abimbola Osundairo, into custody. The Osundario brothers were questioned, but not charged and were released on Friday. According to CNN, they are cooperating with the investigation.

On Thursday, February 14, officials with the Chicago Police Department said they didn't have reason to believe Smollett orchestrated the attack.

However, by Friday afternoon the department said that the investigation had ""shifted,"" and on Saturday, two law-enforcement sources told CNN that CPD believed Smollett may have staged the attack and paid the two brothers.

In a statement to INSIDER on Tuesday, the CPD confirmed that information from the persons questioned had changed its trajectory, and the department hopes to speak to Smollett's attorneys for another interview.

On Saturday, Smollett's attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement to CNN in response to reports that he staged the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement to CNN read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

INSIDER contacted Smollett's representative and his legal team for comment. We will update as necessary.

Smollett was reportedly cut from some ""Empire"" scenes this week while the investigation continues."

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit=""Fox"" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-filename=""190109-the-masked-singer-rabbit.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2019/01/10"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit="""" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-filename=""181218-the-masked-singer.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2018/12/19"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

The outlet says that in addition, the four scenes he is in are no longer focusing on him and are ensemble scenes. Smollett is now only working Friday and perhaps Thursday instead of every day this week and will not be rehearsing. The script for the episode has undergone several changes over the last day or so.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he intends to nominate Jeffrey Rosen, a longtime litigator and deputy transportation secretary, to replace Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general.

In his current post, the 60-year-old Rosen serves as the Transportation Department’s chief operating officer and is in charge of implementing the department’s safety and technological priorities. He rejoined DOT in 2017 after previously serving as general counsel from 2003 to 2006.

From 2006 until 2009, Rosen was the general counsel and a senior policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget. He also worked as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

Rosen held a variety of positions, including senior partner, at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, the same law firm as the new attorney general, William Barr. Rosen spent nearly 30 years at Kirkland & Ellis in a variety of management roles, including acting as the co-head of the firm’s Washington office, he told senators at his confirmation hearing in March 2017.

“His years of outstanding legal and management experience make him an excellent choice to succeed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has served the Department of Justice over many years with dedication and distinction,” Barr said in a statement.

APNewsBreak: Feds share watchlist with 1,400 private groups

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — The federal government has acknowledged that it shares its terrorist watchlist with more than 1,400 private entities, including hospitals and universities, prompting concerns from civil libertarians that those mistakenly placed on the list could face a wide variety of hassles in their daily lives.

The government’s admission that it shares the list so broadly comes after years of insistence that the list is generally not shared with the private sector.

Gadeir Abbas, a lawyer with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has filed a constitutional challenge to the government’s use of the watchlist, called the government’s admission shocking.

“We’ve always suspected there was private-sector dissemination of the terror watchlist, but we had no idea the breadth of the dissemination would be so large,” Abbas said.

The watchlist is supposed to include only those who are known or suspected terrorists but contains hundreds of thousands of names. The government’s no-fly list is culled from a small subset of the watchlist.

Trump wants California to pay back billions for bullet train

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it plans to cancel $929 million awarded to California’s high-speed rail project and wants the state to return an additional $2.5 billion that it has already spent.

The U.S. Department of Transportation announcement follows through on President Donald Trump’s threats to claw back $3.5 billion that the federal government gave to California to build a bullet train between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed a fight to keep the money and said the move was in response to California again suing the administration , this time over Trump’s emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

“This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won’t sit idly by,” Newsom said in a statement. “This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it.”

It’s the latest spat between the White House and California. Trump earlier in the day linked the emergency declaration lawsuit to the train, noting that California filed the challenge on behalf of 16 states.

Deadly crackdown stokes fear among protesters in Venezuela

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Jhonny Godoy had taken to Twitter to proclaim his opposition to President Nicolas Maduro, posting a video that showed him running through the streets waving the national flag as protests erupted across Venezuela’s capital.

Two days later, his family said, rifle-wielding special police agents wearing black masks stormed into their home in the Caracas slum of La Vega, pulled him outside and shot him to death.

The slaying of the 29-year-old was part of a crackdown that has spread fear among young protesters in poor neighbourhoods of Venezuela, where a history of steadfast loyalty to Maduro has begun to crack amid hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. At least 43 people have been killed in the round of protests that began last month, when Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled congress, declared himself interim president of the crisis-wracked country.

Human rights groups say some of those deaths appear to be targeted slayings by the National Police Action Force, or FAES, an elite commando unit created in 2017 for anti-gang operations. Rights groups say it is now acting against disaffected youths living in the slums.

“Maduro seeks to sow fear,” said Rafael Uzcategui, co-ordinator of the respected rights group Venezuelan Education-Action Program on Human Rights, known as PROVEA. More than 700 opponents of Maduro have been arrested during the latest push by Venezuela’s opposition to oust the socialist leader, according to PROVEA and a crime monitoring group, Observatory of Social Conflict.

Police dismiss tip Smollett, 2 brothers together in elevator

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

Flynn pushed to share nuclear tech with Saudis, report says

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials, according to a new congressional report citing whistleblowers within the Trump administration.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the U.S. technology were transferred without proper safeguards.

The Democratic-led House oversight committee opened an investigation Tuesday into the claims by several unnamed whistleblowers who said they witnessed “abnormal acts” in the White House regarding the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The report raises concerns about whether some in a White House marked by “chaos, dysfunction and backbiting” sought to circumvent national security procedures to push a Saudi deal that could financially benefit close supporters of the president.

The report comes at a time when lawmakers are increasingly uneasy with the close relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia, which has raised alarms even among members of the president’s party in Congress. President Donald Trump has made the kingdom a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the Middle East as he tries to further isolate Iran. In the process, he has brushed off criticism over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ role in the war in Yemen.

Mexico closes temporary migrant shelter near US border

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Officials in the northern Mexico border state of Coahuila said Tuesday they have closed a shelter in the border city of Piedras Negras where about 1,600 Central American migrants had been confined during the past two weeks.

Many of the migrants have been bused to neighbouring states, leading to complaints that Coahuila was dumping migrants on other cities to clear out the camp at an empty factory building.

Armando Cabada, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, to the west, said Monday that he might file a complaint against Coahuila officials. “They are offering them free transportation to bring them here. That kind of thing is not fair,” Cabada said.

Jose Borrego, a Coahuila state spokesman, confirmed that the shelter in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, was closed Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled.

The shelter’s population had been steadily falling since last week as migrants who had obtained humanitarian visas were given bus rides to other cities where they would have a better chance of finding work.

Man pleads guilty in rape, murder of Pennsylvania teen

DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty on Tuesday in the rape, murder and dismemberment of a 14-year-old girl, and the victim’s adoptive mother has agreed to plead guilty and serve a life sentence.

Jacob Sullivan, 46, pleaded guilty to all charges in the 2016 death of Grace Packer. A jury outside Philadelphia will determine a sentence of either life in prison or death.

Grace’s adoptive mother, Sara Packer, 44, is expected to testify against Sullivan during the penalty phase of his trial. Packer has agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, according to her attorney, Keith Williams.

Sullivan was Sara’s boyfriend.

Prosecutors have said that Sara Packer, a former foster parent and county adoptions supervisor, watched Sullivan act out a rape-murder fantasy they shared.

Legal hurdles would look familiar in any new R. Kelly case

CHICAGO (AP) — Prosecutors will have to clear a series of high legal hurdles if they intend to charge R. Kelly and convict him, even if there’s video evidence.

One case illustrates the difficulties: The R&B star’s own 2008 trial at which he was acquitted. At the heart of that child pornography trial was a VHS recording that prosecutors said showed Kelly, in his 30s at the time, having sex with a girl as young as 13 sometime between 1998 and 2000.

Speculation that Kelly, now 52, could face new charges arose after attorney Michael Avenatti said he recently gave prosecutors a VHS tape of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, although it’s not clear when it allegedly was recorded.

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx hasn’t commented about whether a grand jury has convened to consider charges against Kelly. But Foxx may feel emboldened to bring new charges in the #MeToo era, said one legal scholar.

“Because they couldn’t get the conviction in 2008, the state’s attorney’s office may feel justice wasn’t done and they may want to take another stab at it,” said DePaul University College of Law professor Monu Bedi, who teaches criminal law and procedure and has followed the Kelly case closely.

Kim or Trump? Hanoi barber offers leaders’ hairdos for free

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At a barbershop tucked away in a small Hanoi alley, Le Phuc Hai patiently waits for his hair dye to bleach his natural black into the colour of the president of the United States.

On a chair next to him, 9-year-old To Gia Huy emerges as a spitting image of a miniature Kim Jong Un.

“Many people say that I look like Kim Jong Un, especially when I have this hairstyle,” said Huy, who was nicknamed “Un” for his likeness to the North Korean leader.

He was unable to hide his excitement that Kim is coming to the Vietnamese capital next week for his second summit with President Donald Trump, and hopes for a chance to see him in person.

As the summit frenzy shakes Hanoi, hairdresser Le Tuan Duong has joined in, offering free Trump or Kim hairstyles to about a dozen customers.

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit=""Fox"" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-filename=""190109-the-masked-singer-rabbit.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2019/01/10"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit="""" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-filename=""181218-the-masked-singer.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2018/12/19"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

Simon'],https://static.pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/user-content/12/files/2019/02/Unknown-2.sized-770x415xc.jpeg,"['effort', 'including', 'isnt', 'iran', 'rights', 'man', 'ambassador', 'criminalization', 'post', 'worldwide', 'trump', 'homosexuality', 'ric', 'grenell', 'germany', 'spearheads', 'end']","[UPDATE AT END]

One of the fascinating, though disturbing, aspects of our mega-hypocritical culture (the word hypocrisy is no longer sufficient), augmented by an equally mega-biased media, is that you have to look extremely closely to understand what is actually happening—for example, who is really supporting human rights and who is not.

Obama, as most will recall, wasn’t particularly concerned with applying such a concept to the Iran deal. He was even less interested in supporting the democracy demonstrators in that country in their fight for freedom during which many were jailed, injured, tortured and/or killed—one of the more shameful moments in American history.

But along comes the putatively racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, transphobic, ageist, ableist (have I missed anything?) Donald Trump and the reverse is true. First, he nominates Ric Grenell—an extraordinary man I have known for roughly a decade, who makes no attempt whatsoever to hide his gayness—to the most important ambassadorial post in Europe: Germany. Then Mr. Grenell proceeds to do many things ambassadors don’t normally do, including pressuring major German companies like Volkswagen to comply with U.S. sanctions on the mullahs. He isn’t always popular with his hosts, ruffling feathers in the sclerotic EU as well—the European record on human rights not being exceptionally attractive—but he is getting results.

He has now outdone himself. Via Benjamin Weinthal:

A Jerusalem Post report on the Iranian regime’s public hanging of a man based on an anti-gay law led to the Trump administration’s announcement on Tuesday to end the criminalization of homosexuality across the world. The US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the administration’s most high-profile openly gay official, told the Post on Tuesday that “71 countries criminalize homosexuality and eight will put you to death for being gay. The Trump Administration is launching a new push with our European allies to end this human rights outrage.” Grenell is spearheading the international effort to stop the persecution of the LGBT community in countries that impose criminal penalties, including the death penalty, on homosexuals.

In other words, Grenell is out to save lives—a lot of them. As noted, Iran is not the only country that hangs gays. (You can see plenty of gruesome photos of this on the internet if you haven’t already.) Saudi Arabia, Yemen (Pelosi’s favorite), Qatar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the UAE also impose capital punishment on same-sex relations. I don’t know the fate of gays from the other sixty-some of the 71 countries, but I imagine it isn’t pretty.

Ironically, in the era of the pathetic Jussie Smollett (a man few of us had heard of before this week), not to mention posturing from the jejune Cory Booker, etc., it is the Trump administration that is actually doing something concrete for gays, something that neither Obama nor Clinton (nor any of the growing number of current Democratic candidates, for that matter) even mentioned, let alone attempted.

See what I mean about finding a new word for hypocrisy?

Anyway, my friend Ric (I am proud to say that), who was on multiple occasions over a number of years the communications director for several of our UN ambassadors (including Bolton), is being floated to replace Nikki Haley now that Heather Nauert has taken herself out of the running. I am of two minds about this. At this juncture, it may be that ambassador to powerful Germany is a more important position than ambassador to the basically ineffectual UN. Germany is the troublemaker still making deals with Iran and Russia. (I’m confused. Isn’t Trump supposed to be Putin’s lackey? Oh, wait.) For the sake of all of us, it might be better to keep Grenell in Europe.

But whatever the case, Ric Grenell is one of the few public servants I know of with the guts and moral fiber we so desperately need, and almost never have, in key leadership positions. Dare I say—well, I guess I already did in the headline—that he should be considered somewhere down the line for our first openly gay president?

UPDATE: I notice in the comments some think I am playing identity politics, which I normally abhor. I take their point to some extent, but, to be clear, I would support Ric Grenell for high office whatever his sexual preference, based on his character and policies, which are ultimately what interest me. In a sense, I was trying to “trigger” the left by playing their identity politics back to them, because it is so hypocritical. If that point wasn’t clear, I apologize. As for those who condemn homosexuality in general, I have nothing to say but that I adamantly disagree.

Roger L. Simon—co-founder and CEO Emeritus of PJ Media—is a prize-winning novelist and an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter. He is also, regrettably, white and cisgendered, which means he may be basically finished. He is desperately trying to finish his last novel before this is so."

Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats is taking over the case.

""Shortly after the incident occurred in late January, State’s Attorney Foxx had conversations with a family member of Jussie Smollett about the incident and their concerns, and facilitated a connection to the Chicago Police Department who were investigating the incident,"" a statement from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office read. ""Based on those prior conversations and out of an abundance of caution, last week State’s Attorney Foxx decided to remove herself from the decision making in this matter and delegated it to her First Assistant Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.”

On Tuesday, the two brothers from Nigeria and their lawyer went before prosecutors and police at the Cook County courthouse. The brothers and their attorney were ushered in and out of the building in total secrecy – treatment rarely granted by prosecutors and usually reserved for celebrities like the time Oprah Winfrey went there for jury duty.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt was seen walking out of a room marked “Grand Jury” and when asked about her clients, she said she simply had no comment.

Police tell FOX 32 the brothers did not testify before a grand jury. Police also say the brothers are cooperating as it appears they are trying to build a case against Smollett.

Meanwhile, federal investigators are still investigating the hate letter that was sent to Smollett at the “Empire” studios. That is a separate investigation from the one conducted by Chicago police. If the feds find that Smollett did send that letter to himself and can prove it, he could also be facing federal charges separate from the case that Chicago PD is building.

Foxx recusing herself comes on the same day CPD investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Former Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez took shots at her successor's recusal Wednesday, writing on her public Facebook page: ""Maybe I should have just recused myself from the difficult cases that came across my desk when I was State's Attorney. I was under the impression that when the voters elected me and I took my oath of office it meant I had to do my job."""

Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed a fight to keep the money and said the move was in response to California again suing the administration , this time over Trump’s emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

“This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won’t sit idly by,” Newsom said in a statement. “This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it.”

It’s the latest spat between the White House and California. Trump earlier in the day linked the emergency declaration lawsuit to the train, noting that California filed the challenge on behalf of 16 states.

Deadly crackdown stokes fear among protesters in Venezuela

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Jhonny Godoy had taken to Twitter to proclaim his opposition to President Nicolas Maduro, posting a video that showed him running through the streets waving the national flag as protests erupted across Venezuela’s capital.

Two days later, his family said, rifle-wielding special police agents wearing black masks stormed into their home in the Caracas slum of La Vega, pulled him outside and shot him to death.

The slaying of the 29-year-old was part of a crackdown that has spread fear among young protesters in poor neighbourhoods of Venezuela, where a history of steadfast loyalty to Maduro has begun to crack amid hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. At least 43 people have been killed in the round of protests that began last month, when Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled congress, declared himself interim president of the crisis-wracked country.

Human rights groups say some of those deaths appear to be targeted slayings by the National Police Action Force, or FAES, an elite commando unit created in 2017 for anti-gang operations. Rights groups say it is now acting against disaffected youths living in the slums.

“Maduro seeks to sow fear,” said Rafael Uzcategui, co-ordinator of the respected rights group Venezuelan Education-Action Program on Human Rights, known as PROVEA. More than 700 opponents of Maduro have been arrested during the latest push by Venezuela’s opposition to oust the socialist leader, according to PROVEA and a crime monitoring group, Observatory of Social Conflict.

Police dismiss tip Smollett, 2 brothers together in elevator

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

Flynn pushed to share nuclear tech with Saudis, report says

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials, according to a new congressional report citing whistleblowers within the Trump administration.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the U.S. technology were transferred without proper safeguards.

The Democratic-led House oversight committee opened an investigation Tuesday into the claims by several unnamed whistleblowers who said they witnessed “abnormal acts” in the White House regarding the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The report raises concerns about whether some in a White House marked by “chaos, dysfunction and backbiting” sought to circumvent national security procedures to push a Saudi deal that could financially benefit close supporters of the president.

The report comes at a time when lawmakers are increasingly uneasy with the close relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia, which has raised alarms even among members of the president’s party in Congress. President Donald Trump has made the kingdom a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the Middle East as he tries to further isolate Iran. In the process, he has brushed off criticism over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ role in the war in Yemen.

Mexico closes temporary migrant shelter near US border

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Officials in the northern Mexico border state of Coahuila said Tuesday they have closed a shelter in the border city of Piedras Negras where about 1,600 Central American migrants had been confined during the past two weeks.

Many of the migrants have been bused to neighbouring states, leading to complaints that Coahuila was dumping migrants on other cities to clear out the camp at an empty factory building.

Armando Cabada, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, to the west, said Monday that he might file a complaint against Coahuila officials. “They are offering them free transportation to bring them here. That kind of thing is not fair,” Cabada said.

Jose Borrego, a Coahuila state spokesman, confirmed that the shelter in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, was closed Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled.

The shelter’s population had been steadily falling since last week as migrants who had obtained humanitarian visas were given bus rides to other cities where they would have a better chance of finding work.

Man pleads guilty in rape, murder of Pennsylvania teen

DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty on Tuesday in the rape, murder and dismemberment of a 14-year-old girl, and the victim’s adoptive mother has agreed to plead guilty and serve a life sentence.

Jacob Sullivan, 46, pleaded guilty to all charges in the 2016 death of Grace Packer. A jury outside Philadelphia will determine a sentence of either life in prison or death.

Grace’s adoptive mother, Sara Packer, 44, is expected to testify against Sullivan during the penalty phase of his trial. Packer has agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, according to her attorney, Keith Williams.

Sullivan was Sara’s boyfriend.

Prosecutors have said that Sara Packer, a former foster parent and county adoptions supervisor, watched Sullivan act out a rape-murder fantasy they shared.

Legal hurdles would look familiar in any new R. Kelly case

CHICAGO (AP) — Prosecutors will have to clear a series of high legal hurdles if they intend to charge R. Kelly and convict him, even if there’s video evidence.

One case illustrates the difficulties: The R&B star’s own 2008 trial at which he was acquitted. At the heart of that child pornography trial was a VHS recording that prosecutors said showed Kelly, in his 30s at the time, having sex with a girl as young as 13 sometime between 1998 and 2000.

Speculation that Kelly, now 52, could face new charges arose after attorney Michael Avenatti said he recently gave prosecutors a VHS tape of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, although it’s not clear when it allegedly was recorded.

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx hasn’t commented about whether a grand jury has convened to consider charges against Kelly. But Foxx may feel emboldened to bring new charges in the #MeToo era, said one legal scholar.

“Because they couldn’t get the conviction in 2008, the state’s attorney’s office may feel justice wasn’t done and they may want to take another stab at it,” said DePaul University College of Law professor Monu Bedi, who teaches criminal law and procedure and has followed the Kelly case closely.

Kim or Trump? Hanoi barber offers leaders’ hairdos for free

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At a barbershop tucked away in a small Hanoi alley, Le Phuc Hai patiently waits for his hair dye to bleach his natural black into the colour of the president of the United States.

On a chair next to him, 9-year-old To Gia Huy emerges as a spitting image of a miniature Kim Jong Un.

“Many people say that I look like Kim Jong Un, especially when I have this hairstyle,” said Huy, who was nicknamed “Un” for his likeness to the North Korean leader.

He was unable to hide his excitement that Kim is coming to the Vietnamese capital next week for his second summit with President Donald Trump, and hopes for a chance to see him in person.

As the summit frenzy shakes Hanoi, hairdresser Le Tuan Duong has joined in, offering free Trump or Kim hairstyles to about a dozen customers.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he intends to nominate Jeffrey Rosen, a longtime litigator and deputy transportation secretary, to replace Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general.

APNewsBreak: Feds share watchlist with 1,400 private groups

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — The federal government has acknowledged that it shares its terrorist watchlist with more than 1,400 private entities, including hospitals and universities, prompting concerns from civil libertarians that those mistakenly placed on the list could face a wide variety of hassles in their daily lives.

The government’s admission that it shares the list so broadly comes after years of insistence that the list is generally not shared with the private sector.

Gadeir Abbas, a lawyer with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has filed a constitutional challenge to the government’s use of the watchlist, called the government’s admission shocking.

“We’ve always suspected there was private-sector dissemination of the terror watchlist, but we had no idea the breadth of the dissemination would be so large,” Abbas said.

The watchlist is supposed to include only those who are known or suspected terrorists but contains hundreds of thousands of names. The government’s no-fly list is culled from a small subset of the watchlist.

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit=""Fox"" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer"" data-image-filename=""190109-the-masked-singer-rabbit.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2019/01/10"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit="""" data-image-alt-text=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon"" data-image-filename=""181218-the-masked-singer.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2018/12/19"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1380"" data-image-width=""2070"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""">

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

Gadeir Abbas, a lawyer with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has filed a constitutional challenge to the government’s use of the watchlist, called the government’s admission shocking.

“We’ve always suspected there was private-sector dissemination of the terror watchlist, but we had no idea the breadth of the dissemination would be so large,” Abbas said.

The watchlist is supposed to include only those who are known or suspected terrorists but contains hundreds of thousands of names. The government’s no-fly list is culled from a small subset of the watchlist.

Trump wants California to pay back billions for bullet train

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it plans to cancel $929 million awarded to California’s high-speed rail project and wants the state to return an additional $2.5 billion that it has already spent.

The U.S. Department of Transportation announcement follows through on President Donald Trump’s threats to claw back $3.5 billion that the federal government gave to California to build a bullet train between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed a fight to keep the money and said the move was in response to California again suing the administration , this time over Trump’s emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

“This is clear political retribution by President Trump, and we won’t sit idly by,” Newsom said in a statement. “This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it.”

It’s the latest spat between the White House and California. Trump earlier in the day linked the emergency declaration lawsuit to the train, noting that California filed the challenge on behalf of 16 states.

Deadly crackdown stokes fear among protesters in Venezuela

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Jhonny Godoy had taken to Twitter to proclaim his opposition to President Nicolas Maduro, posting a video that showed him running through the streets waving the national flag as protests erupted across Venezuela’s capital.

Two days later, his family said, rifle-wielding special police agents wearing black masks stormed into their home in the Caracas slum of La Vega, pulled him outside and shot him to death.

The slaying of the 29-year-old was part of a crackdown that has spread fear among young protesters in poor neighbourhoods of Venezuela, where a history of steadfast loyalty to Maduro has begun to crack amid hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. At least 43 people have been killed in the round of protests that began last month, when Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled congress, declared himself interim president of the crisis-wracked country.

Human rights groups say some of those deaths appear to be targeted slayings by the National Police Action Force, or FAES, an elite commando unit created in 2017 for anti-gang operations. Rights groups say it is now acting against disaffected youths living in the slums.

“Maduro seeks to sow fear,” said Rafael Uzcategui, co-ordinator of the respected rights group Venezuelan Education-Action Program on Human Rights, known as PROVEA. More than 700 opponents of Maduro have been arrested during the latest push by Venezuela’s opposition to oust the socialist leader, according to PROVEA and a crime monitoring group, Observatory of Social Conflict.

Police dismiss tip Smollett, 2 brothers together in elevator

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

Flynn pushed to share nuclear tech with Saudis, report says

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials, according to a new congressional report citing whistleblowers within the Trump administration.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the U.S. technology were transferred without proper safeguards.

The Democratic-led House oversight committee opened an investigation Tuesday into the claims by several unnamed whistleblowers who said they witnessed “abnormal acts” in the White House regarding the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The report raises concerns about whether some in a White House marked by “chaos, dysfunction and backbiting” sought to circumvent national security procedures to push a Saudi deal that could financially benefit close supporters of the president.

The report comes at a time when lawmakers are increasingly uneasy with the close relationship between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia, which has raised alarms even among members of the president’s party in Congress. President Donald Trump has made the kingdom a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the Middle East as he tries to further isolate Iran. In the process, he has brushed off criticism over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ role in the war in Yemen.

Mexico closes temporary migrant shelter near US border

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Officials in the northern Mexico border state of Coahuila said Tuesday they have closed a shelter in the border city of Piedras Negras where about 1,600 Central American migrants had been confined during the past two weeks.

Many of the migrants have been bused to neighbouring states, leading to complaints that Coahuila was dumping migrants on other cities to clear out the camp at an empty factory building.

Armando Cabada, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, to the west, said Monday that he might file a complaint against Coahuila officials. “They are offering them free transportation to bring them here. That kind of thing is not fair,” Cabada said.

Jose Borrego, a Coahuila state spokesman, confirmed that the shelter in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, was closed Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled.

The shelter’s population had been steadily falling since last week as migrants who had obtained humanitarian visas were given bus rides to other cities where they would have a better chance of finding work.

Man pleads guilty in rape, murder of Pennsylvania teen

DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty on Tuesday in the rape, murder and dismemberment of a 14-year-old girl, and the victim’s adoptive mother has agreed to plead guilty and serve a life sentence.

Jacob Sullivan, 46, pleaded guilty to all charges in the 2016 death of Grace Packer. A jury outside Philadelphia will determine a sentence of either life in prison or death.

Grace’s adoptive mother, Sara Packer, 44, is expected to testify against Sullivan during the penalty phase of his trial. Packer has agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, according to her attorney, Keith Williams.

Sullivan was Sara’s boyfriend.

Prosecutors have said that Sara Packer, a former foster parent and county adoptions supervisor, watched Sullivan act out a rape-murder fantasy they shared.

Legal hurdles would look familiar in any new R. Kelly case

CHICAGO (AP) — Prosecutors will have to clear a series of high legal hurdles if they intend to charge R. Kelly and convict him, even if there’s video evidence.

One case illustrates the difficulties: The R&B star’s own 2008 trial at which he was acquitted. At the heart of that child pornography trial was a VHS recording that prosecutors said showed Kelly, in his 30s at the time, having sex with a girl as young as 13 sometime between 1998 and 2000.

Speculation that Kelly, now 52, could face new charges arose after attorney Michael Avenatti said he recently gave prosecutors a VHS tape of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, although it’s not clear when it allegedly was recorded.

The office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx hasn’t commented about whether a grand jury has convened to consider charges against Kelly. But Foxx may feel emboldened to bring new charges in the #MeToo era, said one legal scholar.

“Because they couldn’t get the conviction in 2008, the state’s attorney’s office may feel justice wasn’t done and they may want to take another stab at it,” said DePaul University College of Law professor Monu Bedi, who teaches criminal law and procedure and has followed the Kelly case closely.

Kim or Trump? Hanoi barber offers leaders’ hairdos for free

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At a barbershop tucked away in a small Hanoi alley, Le Phuc Hai patiently waits for his hair dye to bleach his natural black into the colour of the president of the United States.

On a chair next to him, 9-year-old To Gia Huy emerges as a spitting image of a miniature Kim Jong Un.

“Many people say that I look like Kim Jong Un, especially when I have this hairstyle,” said Huy, who was nicknamed “Un” for his likeness to the North Korean leader.

He was unable to hide his excitement that Kim is coming to the Vietnamese capital next week for his second summit with President Donald Trump, and hopes for a chance to see him in person.

As the summit frenzy shakes Hanoi, hairdresser Le Tuan Duong has joined in, offering free Trump or Kim hairstyles to about a dozen customers.

He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts.

It would be recalled we reported earlier that the case took a new twist after evidence suggested that Smollett may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack.

Reacting to this development, Noah stated that there are portions of Jussie Smollet’s narration which look fishy. He asked,

“Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch ‘Empire’?”

Noah went on,

“I’ve heard of hate-watching but that shit would be next-level. That’s like a member of the Klan buying tickets to ‘Fiddler on the Roof.’”

Sharing a picture of the Nigerian brothers who look ripped, Noah continued,

“I’m not gonna lie, that’s the one part of the story that actually makes sense to me because if I was paying these two to beat me up, I would want to practice too. How many abs does this guy on the left have? It looks like he stole a couple of abs from the other guy. So in the public eye, this story has moved from a hate crime against a popular TV actor to a giant hoax by a popular TV actor, but Smollett still insists there was ‘no collusion.’”

Further reacting to an interview on “Good Morning America” show which saw Smollet burst into tears while narrating the ordeal, Noah said he deserves an Oscar if the whole case turns out he was lying.

“Either this guy’s telling the truth, or he deserves an Emmy for that interview because if all of that is just a performance, I don’t care what he’s lying about, you can’t cancel him. He’s just too good to not be on TV.”

It would be recalled Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B also slammed Smollett when she said he ruined Black History Month if it turns out he is lying about the attack."

As with so much else regarding the left, that's nonsense. They cut, paste, and amplify the unsubstantiated ardor of liberal Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram at will -- if it advances the narrative. See the case of Jussie Smollett, actor/singer in the Fox hip-hop drama Empire.

Smollett's “MAGA country” hate-crime hoax is just the latest example and coming on the heels of the smears of the Covington Catholic MAGA-hat teens, we must conclude they're too blind, or too stupid, or maybe they just don't give a hoot. Nothing says “viral” like a black, gay celebrity claiming he was beaten by Trumpster thugs. For two weeks, the left went nuts. Celebrities took to the celebrity talk shows, politicians to the political talk shows and the ""news"" media to the ""news"" media to denounce racist conservative Trump World. Two weeks later, the actor’s “modern-day lynching” narrative has imploded. As we've come to expect, the arrogant defenders of the “high-quality news organizations” are once again refusing to take responsibility for the gasoline they tossed on the fire.

See CNN Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter of the so-called “Facts First” network. Stelter claimed “ultimately, this is not about the media, or about politicians or activists, or other people that might have been fooled. It is about Jussie.”

Translation: It’s all about the fooler....not the fools.

Later, in his e-mail newsletter, Stelter asked: “Was it newsworthy when the Chicago police opened an investigation into Smollett's accusation? Yes. Did high-quality news organizations approach the case with caution? Yes.”

This is pure nonsense and Stelter knows it. The national media jumped into the allegations like children jump into a mud puddle. Just ABC, CBS, and NBC devoted157 morning and evening minutes to the Smollett fraud. Some of these stories “alleged.” Some didn't bother even that.

Compare. Two years ago in that same city there was another attack. Four black thugs bound and gagged an innocent, defenseless mentally disabled 18-year-old white man. He was beaten, kicked, made to drink from a toilet bowl, and bloodied from cuts to his scalp. The suspects laughed at him and shouted “f--- Trump” and “f--- white people.” They were arrested; he went into the emergency room. The entire attack was captured on video -- and streamed live on Facebook. ""If it bleeds it leads""? Not on your life, not something like this. The networks gave the story, and all its graphic gore a whopping 27 seconds that night.

Smollett’s story collapsed shortly after an embarrassingly supportive interview with ABC’s Robin Roberts. Call the show Good Fawning America. Roberts did not approach with “caution.” She chose not to use the word “alleged.” It was true because he said so and she wanted to believe him because she believes this is what Trump supporters do. She began with “What do people need to hear the most, about this story?” Smollett said “Just the truth.” Her most ridiculous question was this: “If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?”

Oh, he knew the attackers. Very well.

Kudos to Michelle Malkin, who called out the media early for not asking these obvious questions:

1. How many racist homophobes wander around an upscale neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country?”

2. How many racist homophobes have ever heard of Empire and could recognize Jussie Smollett from his gay character on the show?

Red flags were visible everywhere, including the fact that the Chicago police told Malkin they initially hadn’t heard the “MAGA country” claims. Early claims that Smollett had broken ribs were false.

President Trump, no doubt advised not to mutter “Fake News” about the story, called the story “horrible.” But in the end, it underlined why so many conservatives feel the “news” business seems isn’t defined by the maxim “Facts First.” It’s “Fakes First.”"

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett's absurd hate crime claims, few in the ""professional"" journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone's a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone's making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I'm especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I've chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

TRENDING: Principal gets booted after posting comments critical of Black Lives Matter

– Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" claiming she found a ""degrading"" noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried ""systematic racism"" and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn't add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

– Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism – until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted ""conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner."" Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

– University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a ""racist display"" of three ""noose-like objects"" hanging from trees. The UD president called it ""deplorable""; protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the ""nooses"" were metal ""remnants of paper lanterns"" hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

– Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school's library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

– Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the ""noose"" was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who ""may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.""

– Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. ""A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,"" the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the ""noose"" was a ""packaged leather shoelace"" that someone had dropped accidentally.

– Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of ""nooses"" lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the ""latest in a string of hate incidents"" after Trump's election. The African-American museum director called them a ""reminder of America's dark history."" But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

– Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and ""hate signs"" found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett's folly, media sensationalists bluster that there's no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn't take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you've seen one social justice huckster, you've seen 'em all."

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman.

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking.

The 36-year-old star of TV drama ""Empire"" told police on January 29 that two masked men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck on the streets of downtown Chicago.

Public figures including Emma Watson, Katy Perry, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden led an outpouring of sympathy for Smollett, with Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker decrying ""an attempted modern-day lynching.""

President Donald Trump commented that the alleged attack was ""horrible.""

Now police say they want to speak to the actor again after two ""potential suspects"" were released without charge, with US media outlets reporting that the attack may have been staged.

Smollett, who has hired a prominent criminal defense attorney, said his assailants used racial and homophobic slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" -- a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But Chicago TV station WBBM reported that the suspects claimed Smollett hired them to stage the attack, because he was unhappy that a threatening letter he had earlier received had not gotten enough attention.

Chicago Police spokeswoman Jessica Rocco told AFP detectives had received a tip that the suspects were seen with Smollett in the elevator of his apartment building on the night of the incident.

Police are working to confirm the tip, said Rocco, who would not reveal whether there was video evidence.

""We do not have any further details at this time,"" Rocco told AFP.

The suspects were identified as brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who had ties to Smollett, according to US media.

The probe could be handed to a grand jury this week, according to the celebrity news website TMZ, which reported Tuesday that the actor's role on ""Empire"" has been curtailed.

Fox declined to comment."

It's a story of today's progressive identity politics and how it elevates group victimhood to the highest of virtues.

In the early morning of Jan. 29, actor Jussie Smollett of the Fox series “Empire” claimed that he was ambushed outside a restaurant in Chicago. According to the police, Smollett claimed “two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him. The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

Smollett also said that his attackers knew who he was. He later confirmed accounts that his attackers had identified him personally and shouted, “This is MAGA Country,"" a reference to President Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

From the beginning, the story was difficult to believe. Obviously, Chicago is not ""MAGA Country."" Even in ""MAGA Country,"" one seldom finds roving bands of Trumpers carrying nooses and randomly assaulting people late at night for what appears to be political intimidation. The odds also seem small that redneck MAGA people anywhere in the country watch ""Empire"" and know the personal lives of the actors.

As of this writing, Smollett’s story seems to have unraveled. Prosecutors are reportedly investigating whether he filed a false police report. The two “attackers,” both reportedly Smollett’s acquaintances, have told police that he paid them to help stage the incident. He was allegedly unhappy that a threatening letter sent to his studio hadn’t gotten more attention.

But this isn’t just about Smollett’s need for attention. This apparent hoax, the latest of dozens of fake hate crimes alleged against Trump supporters in the Trump era, has an ideological root as well. It comes from the same playbook as the lies leveled last month against the now-famous students of Covington Catholic.

At the heart of both deceptions is a postmodern belief system whose central tenet is that one’s racial and social identity supersede truth and reality. According to this intersectional system of thinking, the distinction between not only good and evil but also between fact and fiction is determined not based on choices made and moral reasoning, nor on evidence and facts, but rather on one’s position in a grand hierarchy of historical victimhood.

In short, if your ancestors might have been oppressed, then you have stored up treasure in heaven, even though it happened before you were born. If your ancestors might have been oppressors, then you are stained with original sin, a sin you did not directly commit, the stain of which no baptism or penance can ever wash away. (Well, maybe not if you’re a powerful Democratic officeholder .)

In the case of the Covington students — white, all boys, Christian, marching against abortion, and some wearing red Trump hats they had just purchased from D.C. vendors — the assumption of their guilt was, naturally, automatic. The first question about their conduct led to an immediate and national swarm of defamation, online bullying, and violent threats. And the defamation and bullying (which could happen to your kids, dear reader) continued even after all the facts were widely known and they had been exonerated.

According to intersectional thinking, all of this bullying and lying are justified. If you happen to come from a background adjudged as historically privileged, then by default your conduct is considered blameworthy upon accusation, and your opinions or accounts less valuable.

That is the one side of the coin. It was on the other side that Smollett was trying to imprint his own image with his apparent deception. Being both black and gay, and thinking himself a great deal cleverer than he is, he expected people to believe his implausible story without tracking down the facts.

Those who wanted to believe him did so, just as they had initially believed dozens of hoaxers in every part of America. But the story appears to be false. And Trump’s supporters, thus maligned by an influential celebrity, are as right to be joyful in their vindication as any other class of person falsely blamed for something none of them did.

Unfortunately for all the hoaxers, defamers, online bullies, and postmodern thinkers of the modern Left, courts of law do not buy into intersectional theory, nor can they as long as law and justice remain as live concepts. They look at facts, and they do not care about the backgrounds of those who attest to them.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Smollett paid two acquaintances to stage a fake attack against him. A civil court may soon decide whether multiple rich celebrities and deep-pocketed news organizations showed negligence when they defamed a group of ordinary Kentucky high schoolers.

In these and all other cases, let justice be done based on facts and evidence, for the law is no respecter of persons."

Mr. Smollett is in the custody of detectives, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said

The Empire player was taken into custody a few hours after he was charged with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that could bring 1 to 3.5 years in state prison.

A charge of disorderly conduct has been approved against “Empire” gay activist black actor Jussie Smollett, according to an e-Mail from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

Filing a false police report is disorderly conduct, according to Illinois Criminal Code.

Disorderly conduct is a class 4 felony, the State’s Attorney Office says.

A bail hearing is scheduled for 1:30p CST Thursday.

Jussie Smollett faces prison, career ruin if he lied about attack. Grand Jury to hear testimony of the ‘2 Brothers’, they are standing by,

The Jussie Smollett, 36 anni, mystery moved into a Chicago courthouse Tuesday, as the 2 brothers who said the actor paid them to stage an attack on him were talking to prosecutors.

The brothers spent the afternoon at the Cook County courthouse, where a grand jury was deliberating. It is a possible sign of increasing legal peril for the openly gay black activists actor who says he was assaulted in the street weeks ago.

It was not immediately clear if they had actually testified yet, but they are expected to. That could lead to an indictment of 36-year old Smollett.

Police said the 2 brothers said during interrogation last week that Mr. Smollett paid for them to fake an attack. While initially the 2 were considered possible suspects, their cooperation has led the investigation in the direction of Mr. Smollett himself as the perp.

Source: Brothers say Jussie Smollett paid them to participate in alleged attack.



Jussie Smollett

Mr. Smollett said he was beaten in an unprovoked attack by 2 men yelling homophobic and racist slurs. He said they doused him with a chemical, draped a noose around his neck and yelled “this is MAGA country,” all as he was walking from a restaurant at 2:00a in 10 degree weather.

Mr. Smollett’s legal team said Tuesday, “we are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner.”

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police today in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment today.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said today that she is recusing herself from the investigation.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have not further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

Monster

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him -- a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox.

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama Empire, ignited a furore on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged January 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was “angered and devastated” by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defence lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

Empire debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

On the latest episode of The Masked Singer, Rumer Willis was revealed as the Lion and Joey Fatone was unmasked as the Rabbit — just as we had predicted. Which means take these best guesses at the finalists very seriously — but enjoy our stabs at worst guesses too because why not have a little fun?

Just three if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown, Tommy Chong, Rumer Willis and Joey Fatone all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Peacock, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Monster

The Masked Singer, with Nick Cannon

The hints: A soulful singer from the South, Monster has said he was once at the top of his game and the game turned on him — a sure sign this is someone who's been off the A-list for a minute. He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete — perhaps a golfer or a boxer — especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

Bee

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated — all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys — seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips — but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

Peacock

The Masked Singer Photo: Fox



The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" — a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on Fox."

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

He's made a few allusions to sharing his ""true"" voice with the world, and thrown in some references to perhaps being an athlete -- perhaps a golfer or a boxer -- especially when he said he was going to come out swinging.

Best guesses: Gucci Mane and Lil Jon.

Worst guesses: Mike Tyson, Tommy Davidson and Diddy. Monster can actually sing, which rules out Mike Tyson's distinctive pitch and Tommy Davidson's nasally whine too. Diddy is a non-starter since he's not only from New York, but would never voluntarily rob the world of a chance to see his face.

Donnie Wahlberg Claims He Doesn't Know if He's on The Masked Singer

It's probably: T-Pain, the singer-rapper who rose to great heights in the early aughts but has fallen out of favor in the rap and R&B world. He's from Tallahassee, and his onetime reliance on Auto-Tune as part of his schtick gives his note about showing his real voice context. Nobody's really heard him sing any other way, Monster seems to be saying, even if his voice is unmistakable. Also, T-Pain was famously involved in a pretty bad accident in a golf cart once, so he very well could be the golf aficionado no one knew.

The hints: She's got 10 Grammys, collected during her long career she said goes back to the 1950s. In her segment where she had to bring out an item to tease her identity, she showed bakeware.

Best guesses: Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle have been floated -- all of them reasonable stabs.

Worst guesses: It's not Diana Ross as Robin Thicke once said. Diana's hair won't even fit in that costume let alone her big diva aura.

It's probably: Gladys Knight. She not only has a combined 10 Grammys -- seven as a solo artist and three more with the Pips -- but she is the only other singer alive who could sound as good as Bee does that's been around since the 1950s and is known for cooking. (Though closed, Gladys Knight's Chicken & Waffles was once an institution in Atlanta.) While Patti LaBelle also sounds good and cooks, her unmatched voice sounds much different than Knight's.

The hints: He says he's been in the game a minute, making his stage debut at age 5. He's been seen playing with a deck of cards, twirling the inside of his cape to reveal a rainbow-colored flag and playing piano, so he's absolutely a showman. One of his biggest clues thus far was his admission that it's probably been a while since ""your mom had posters of me on her bedroom wall"" -- a breadcrumb heightened by the admission that he's done a magic act in the past.

Best guesses: Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Donny Osmond.

Worst guesses: Elton John, who is loading a gun full of sequins to shoot at those who suggest he'd do this.

It's probably: Donny Osmond. A child star, pianist and one-time winner of Dancing with the Stars, Osmond is the preeminent showman on the reality circuit, and Peacock's fine moves on the floor square up with the performer's wide-ranging talents.

Just five if-you-say-so-lebrities remain on The Masked Singer, the reality competition that made TV history by being the first of its kind to be both more bizarre and more enjoyable than the real-life news cycle. With LaToya Jackson, Ricki Lake, Tori Spelling, Margaret Cho, Terry Bradshaw, Antonio Brown and Tommy Chong all sent back to their pre-existing levels of recognizability, The Masked Singer still has Rabbit, Peacock, Lion, Monster and Bee putting on those gorgeous getups every week to stump the viewing public in the only TV-related puzzle almost as as gripping as whatever the hell is happening with Jussie Smollett. Who could be behind the masks? Let's dive in.

Rabbit

The hints: Rabbit has said he's been on stage a lot but was never alone, and when judges straight-up asked him if he was in a boy band, Rabbit said he's in a band -- a not-at-all subtle dodge that pretty much confirms he's a boy bander. Rabbit has made a few references to 'N Sync, and recently admitted that he has 17 tattoos, which seems like a cruel thing to do to a rabbit, but OK.

Best guesses: Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, and Donnie Wahlberg.

Worst guesses: Justin Timberlake. Justin's voice is instantly recognizable, his smooth moves are unmistakable and, based on the the caliber of talent revealed so far, it's safe to bet Justin didn't make himself available for this if asked.

It's probably: Joey Fatone. Rabbit's nods to 'N Sync make it certain he's one of the once spikey-haired musicians. Rabbit's admission that ""he loves to sink his teeth into a big, fat Italian ice"" has to be a tip to his role in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films and his Italian roots.

Lion

The hints: Like Rabbit, Lion has teased that she's been henceforth known in relation to others more so than for her solo work, but as opposed to being in a group, she's teased that she's Hollywood nobility and there are lots of women in her pride. Lion is one of the best singers in the bunch, with a full-throttle voice, but her revelation that she's showing her true self for the first time suggests she's not a professional, full-time belter.

Best guesses: A member of Fifth Harmony, Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child.

Worst guesses: Lady Gaga. Come on now, be serious.

It's probably: Rumer Willis. As the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, she's absolutely a Hollywood O.G., and since she has four sisters, that makes her comment about the women in her sphere resonant. To boot, she's a Leo, has (or at least used to have) a lion tattoo, and she's been on Empire, where she hung around with the Lyon pride. Case closed.

The “Empire” actor will now be investigated by the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

According ABC News, the two federal agencies are investigating whether Smollett wrote the threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set on Jan. 22, seven days before the alleged attack.

The letter featured an awkward drawing of a man hanging from a tree with a gun pointed at him. It also featured the words, “You will die black f-g,” and MAGA (Make Great America Great). There was a powdered substance discovered that was reportedly aspirin.

Smollett initially told police that he was attacked in Chicago by two White men who wore Make America Great Again hats and yelled racial and homophobic slurs on Jan. 29. During the attack, Smollett said the men poured a chemical substance on him and tied a rope around his neck. When he arrived at the hospital, the rope was still around his neck.

Police questioned two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, on Feb. 15. Police learned that the brothers purchased the rope from an Ace Hardware store in the Chicago area. CBS reports that the brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. After the attack, they returned to Nigeria.

Following the interrogation, the brothers, who both appeared as extras on “Empire,” were released from police custody.

Smollett could face charges of filing a false report if it is proven that he lied about the entire incident."

8:25 p.m.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

4:50 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says two brothers who were arrested and later released from custody in connection with the attack reported by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have met with police and prosecutors at the courthouse.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the meeting happened Tuesday in Chicago. He also said that officers have determined a tip that the two men may have been in an elevator with Smollett last month was not credible. He said video evidence helped them make that determination.

Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

The Jussie Smollett “hate crime” saga appears to be reaching its pitiful denouement. Chicago Police are now requesting a follow-up interview with the Empire actor, following the confession of Smollett’s alleged accomplices. A pair of Nigerian brothers, at least one of whom has known ties to the so-called “victim” and his television show, have reportedly told authorities that Smollett paid them to stage an attack. Officials confronted the pair with evidence of their purchase of rope and red baseball caps, prompting them to point the finger back at Smollett, claiming that he even requested a dry run-style “rehearsal” of the phony assault. Smollett’s camp released an indignant statement insisting that he’s still a victim, stating that he had no idea his attackers were known to him. Shortly thereafter, Smollett parted ways with his lawyer and obtained a new legal team.

We’ve been following this case closely, and it is now apparent to me how the final chapter of all this is going to play out.

Sooner or later, Smollett will be charged by either the Chicago PD or possible even the U.S. Dept. of Justice, related to the mailed threat letter that hasn’t been widely reported by the media yet. There’s no question in my mind that law enforcement authorities already have sufficient evidence to charge Smollett. It’s only a matter of time before it happens.

Once Smollett is charged, he will almost certainly try to play the “sympathy race card” by publicly confessing to staging the whole thing. Importantly, this public confession will be paired with a tripling down on self-victimization: Smollett, I predict, will blame Trump for “making me do it.”

Listen to my full podcast for more details:

Prediction: Smollett will blame Trump, saying, “Look what you made me do!”

See, Jussie Smollett is like millions of other indoctrinated young adults in America today: They’ve all been trained how to be expert victims. In college, they learn victimhood and “social justice” victimization. Then they all watched Colin Kaepernick play the victim as an NFL quarterback and reportedly receive a multi-million dollar payout.

Victimology is now the specialty of the deranged, delusional Left. These are people who don’t know how to create economic abundance, run a business in a sustainable way or produce anything of value for society. Instead, they become experts in victimhood, and they play the victim card to its fullest.

Victimhood is the currency of the lunatic Left. The more someone can make themselves look like a victim, the more they are celebrated and praised as a courageous hero of society. Just look at the media circus surrounding Smollett’s staged “hate crimes.” It made him an instant celebrity among the gullible Left, and especially among the Hollywood lunatics who don’t even remember how to fact check anything before running with their desperate narratives.

That’s why I predict Smollett will blame Trump for making him fake his own hate crime. Yes, you read that correctly: It’s all going to be Trump’s fault, you see.

If Trump wasn’t such a mean racist, the narrative will explain, Smollett wouldn’t have had to fake the hate crime in the first place. It’s Trump’s fault, and besides, we’ll be told, the intention of Smollett was good, since he’s only trying to expose the MAGA hat-wearing hatred that everybody on the Left is convinced exists everywhere anyway.

It’s the Rolling Stone defense: Yes, the Rolling Stone faked a whole series of articles about campus rape, but since they did it to “expose” the campus rape that they claim was happening anyway, it’s all good. To the fact-challenged Left Cult, it never matters whether any facts are present to support their assertions or beliefs… all the matters is that the right stories are being told, regardless of whether they’re really true.

Remember “Hands up, don’t shoot?” Never happened. Complete fiction.

Remember Elizabeth Warren claiming to be a “woman of color?” Total fiction, and it turns out to be such an embarrassment that even she renounced her own claim and apologized to Native Americans.

Remember the media frenzy surrounding the accusations against the Duke University LaCrosse team members in 2006? The entire thing was a hoax, yet nearly every left-wing media outlet had pronounced the white boys guilty without any evidence whatsoever.

As it turns out, nearly all the so-called “hate crimes” in America are actually staged hoaxes. Here’s a list of 17 campus hate crimes that were hoaxed in 2017 alone. There are hundreds more across 2018 and 2019 (so far).

The only real hate crimes in America are the ones that deranged Leftists fabricate to “keep the hate alive”

In fact, it turns out there are hardly any real hate crimes in America aside from the very real (and very violent) attacks on Trump supporters. Antifa’s violence is real, in other words. But all the supposed white supremacy violence against black people on the streets of America is almost entirely fiction.

Think about it: America has become a country with such great opportunities for people of color that they actually have to hire black people to pretend to be white people to stage a hate crime hoax. If racism were really so rampant and so real, they wouldn’t have to hire anybody at all, because the attacks would be frequent and organic."

If Smollett, who is black and gay, did indeed hire two men to “attack” him in the early hours of the morning in Chicago, claiming later that he was assaulted by Trump-supporting rednecks, newsrooms should be asking: What is it that compels left-wing activists to engage in this sort of deceitful and dangerously dishonest behavior? Newsrooms should also be asking whether America has foolishly put a premium on victimhood, incentivizing unscrupulous reward-seekers to allege all sorts of fantastic tales of personal suffering and abuse.

On Monday, as the actor’s claim that he was assaulted in Chicago by men who shouted “This is MAGA country!” continued to fall apart, the Associated Press wasn’t particularly interested in answering any of these questions. It was interested more in absolving those who had immediately believed Smollett’s absurd story, while also throwing a critical eye at those who were skeptical from the start.

In other words, the AP ran cover for Smollet’s like-minded liberal allies, while also leveling the well-worn and tired “conservatives pounce” cliche against the Right.

The AP reported in an article titled, “ New reports in Jussie Smollett case leave some baffled, others outraged” [emphasis added]:



The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.



But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.



[…]



Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.



First, referring to D'Souza and Lahren as “conservative” is a disservice to the word “conservative.” Let’s just say “carnival barker” and call it even.

Second, actors, musicians, politicians, and even members of the news media all cited the Smollett story as evidence of the Right's toxic effect on society, claiming that Trump and company are emboldening others to inflict pain and abuse on minority communities. Actress Ellen Page went so far as to blame Mike Pence for the alleged assault, claiming during an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" that the vice president’s Christian faith encourages things such as the so-called attack on Smollett. For a while there, the Smollett story was used as a broader indictment against all conservatives, as the actor’s allies were quick to claim that Trump and his cohort are monsters who've emboldened other monsters to behave monstrously.

But now that the story has all but fallen apart, and it appears there was no hate crime committed that evening, the AP is really going with “conservative pundits … have gleefully seized on the moment""?

Could it be conservatives are not so much “seizing on the moment” as they’re merely feeling vindicated for having rightly questioned a false story that had been weaponized against them from the moment it was first reported?

Point out inconsistencies in a left-wing activist’s unbelievable allegation? You will be accused of pouncing. Question why media coverage is more critical of the skeptics than the unbelievable allegation? You will be accused of pouncing. Claim vindication after the unbelievable allegation falls apart? You will be accused of pouncing.

From my standpoint, it seems like it doesn’t really matter what the story is or what’s being alleged. If conservatives have a reaction of any sort, no matter what it is they’re responding to, some newsroom will frame the story as if they are exploiting the moment, trying its best to downplay the actual story to which they are reacting."

The media house says this was confirmed by well-placed sources which say that Smollett’s scenes in episodes of the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series are being slashed for production on Empire this week.

And this comes amid reports that he paid the two Nigerian brothers to orchestrate his own attack. The actor was invited for a chat with the Chicago Police Department, but he didn’t show up.

The actor reportedly had a lot of dramatic stints and musical performances in the upcoming season. And now, Deadline adds that there are no plans right to make any changes to the remaining episodes of the fifth season.

Empire returns for the remainder of its fifth season on March 13.

As things heat up concerning the investigation into the assault made on Empire star Jussie Smollett, FOX has decided to lessen the actor’s appearance on the show’s second half of its fifth season.

Empire is currently in production as it gears up for its return on March 13th. The Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson-led hit show reportedly removed some scenes of Smollett as Chicago PD delves deeper into the actor’s case, who is now inclined to believe that Smollett did, in fact, stage the attack.

Deadline reports that the show underwent significant rewrites to reduce Smollett’s appearance and performances in the next episodes. Despite this, plans to make major changes on the show are not yet on the table. FOX did not comment on the matter.

Despite the overflow of support from the network and Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney, the decision to cut Smollett from Empire comes after Chicago PD identified brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo as persons of interest in the case. Both men were extras in the show, and one of whom was Smollett’s personal trainer.

Smollett’s case is becoming a divided issue at the moment, as multiple reports point out that the actor-singer hired his personal trainer to perform the assault. Chicago PD previously refuted claims that Smollett staged the attack. But in light of recent developments, the department has plausible reasons to believe so. Smollett also refused to talk to the Chicago PD following the allegations. Detectives wanted to know more about the actor’s side of the story, as they have previously met with the Osundairo brothers about the incident. Smollett has also lawyered up since it’s being reported that he could face criminal charges if the assertions prove to be true.

Smollett was assaulted on January 29 by two masked men who then tied a noose around him and screamed, “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene. It has been described as a racial and homophobic hate crime. The actor’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement saying, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”"

Fake hate crimes are hate crimes. If hate crime laws are merely instruments of totalitarian political power, rather than sound legal principles applicable to Americans of every color and creed, then it is long past time to get rid of them.

Smollett’s offense went far beyond wasting the police department’s time with a false report, as if that wasn’t bad enough in crime-ridden Chicago. If that is the only charge he faces, he is likely to walk out of the courtroom without paying much of a penalty at all. The law is not exactly coming down on him like a ton of bricks, as he is apparently still free to blow off investigators when they request follow-up interviews.

A federal hate crimes prosecution would make it clear Smollett deliberately targeted a group of Americans with the intention of inciting hatred against them. This cannot be considered acceptable from anyone, no matter how many boxes they can cover on the intersectional victimhood bingo card, and regardless of the skin color or political affiliations of the targets.

It is time to formally acknowledge that left-wing hate hoaxes are one of the most prevalent and dangerous hate crimes in America right now. They’re exceptionally dangerous because they instantly benefit from the combined power of credulous news media and celebrities.

We’re all supposed to be very concerned about information warfare, disinformation, and “meddling” in our politics and society. Hate-crime hoaxes are prime examples of all of those things, and they are far more influential than Russia buying $1000 of Facebook ads or whatever.

No farm-raised Russian troll could dream of whipping up the kind of saturation media coverage Smollett was given. His wildly improbable allegations were treated as hard cold facts by mainstream media outlets that suddenly forgot everything their style books say about using the word “alleged.”

Information warfare specialists can only dream of having their toxic viral memes repeated as enthusiastically as the mainstream media spread the Smollett story. Hostile powers must regard hate hoaxes as dreams come true. This is exactly the kind of anger and chaos they wish to spread among the American people. This is precisely the kind of mutilation they wish to inflict on our politics.

Election meddlers could enjoy nothing more than watching virtually the entire Democratic presidential field for 2020 pick up a hoax without hesitation and use it as a cudgel against the huge number of Americans they despise.

We are supposed to be concerned about the social environment that makes various pathological behaviors more common. Very well: let’s talk about the social environment that makes so many people think nothing of reporting false hate crimes.

Criminal behavior is usually influenced by risk-reward calculations. At the moment, people see little risk in reporting false hate crimes, but they perceive enormous rewards – instant celebrity, the righteous rush of secular sainthood, and possibly financial benefits.

The moral barrier against engaging in this kind of slander has grown very rickety. Hoaxers don’t feel like they’re doing anything wrong because they have imbibed the left-wing concept of Deeper Truth. Sure, maybe Smollett made up his story of a MAGA lynch mob, but his apologists will say they are a real threat lurking all over the place and he performed a public service by “raising awareness” of the problem.

Smollett’s story broke only a few days after the media stuffed the Covington Catholic hoax down the Memory Hole, capping off their disgusting malpractice with a spate of editorials about how the Covington boys were still somehow wrong or problematic even though activist Nathan Phillips fabricated his tale of a menacing MAGA-hatted mob.

Some media leftists managed to slip jabs at the Covington kids into the middle of their soliloquies about the press doing a less than stellar job of covering the story:

4) Yes, this applies in the Covington case. This will please nobody because I still believe the teenagers were disrespectful, but my tweets were lacking in grace. As a Catholic I felt duty bound to speak up and hold them accountable, but that really isn't my job. — Kirsten Powers (@KirstenPowers) February 18, 2019

The Deeper Truth narrative about smirking red-hat Catholic school pro-lifer hatred still bubbles along even though the media had to admit it was utterly hoodwinked by a left-wing activist it did not bother to investigate in even the most cursory fashion.

Why wouldn’t other hoaxers expect similar “fake but accurate” defenses when their phony hate crime reports fall apart? They know they will be given virtually limitless credit for good intentions. The worst media action line they have to fear is: “Okay, maybe everyone involved was wrong and we can all learn something from this teachable moment.” With a little luck, they will be able to argue they were forced into faking a hate crime by the terrible climate of fear President Donald Trump has created.

We can take a step toward fixing that by throwing the book at Jussie Smollett if he’s found guilty of faking a hate crime, which absolutely must be considered as much of a hate crime as the incident he faked. Otherwise, we are reinforcing all of the awful forces that inspire people to invent phony hate crimes, including the poisonous totalitarian idea that some groups are incapable of hatred, while others deserve to be hated, so slandering them is not a serious offense."

When the news broke in the past several days about Jussie Smollett supposedly being attacked by two masked men in Chicago yelling racial and anti-gay slurs, Sharpton immediately voiced support for the gay black actor: “We’re with you, Jussie.”

However, after it was revealed that Smollett and the two other black men had perpetrated a hoax, the MSNBC host responded that the persons involved “ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

That was quite a different tune from an earlier edition of PoliticsNation when he declared: “We can’t make people love each other, but we can sure hold them accountable if they harm each other.”

But on Sunday’s episode, Sharpton attempted to sound much more rational: “Lawyers for Smollett remain adamant that their client was a victim of a hate crime centering on his race and sexual orientation amid some reports that Smollett may have colluded with two former persons of interest to stage the alleged attack.”

He then noted:

I, among many others, when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific, and that we should come with all that we can come with -- in law enforcement -- to find out what happened. And the guilty should suffer the maximum. I still maintain that. And if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.

Of course, Sharpton defended people on the political left against accusations that they might be involved in the incident.

“But let's not act like this is some left-wing hoax that some are saying on social media,” he asserted. “President Trump called this horrible, and he is certainly not a left-winger.”

In addition, “many across the spectrum -- because of Smollett’s history as an actor and an activist -- stood and said this needs to be looked into. None of us talked directly with him. We were alarmed at what was reported.”

Nevertheless, the host did single out one person for criticism: the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who “started tweeting yesterday: ‘Well, they just did this to discredit those that wear MAGA hats.’”

In response, Sharpton growled: ”Jussie Smollett went on Good Morning America, Don Jr., and said: ‘It never happened.’ He doesn’t know how that got out. So people like me that were told that were being misled.”

“Let us get to the bottom of it and let justice be done no matter who is right or wrong,” he added. “We cannot not get to the truth here.”

That’s an interesting claim coming from someone who burst onto the national stage in the late 1980s as the spokesman for Tawana Brawley, a black teenager who asserted that she had been raped by four white men in Wappingers Falls, New York, and then left wrapped in a feces-covered plastic bag with racial slurs written on her body.

However, after an extensive investigation filled with twists and turns, a grand jury found the allegations to be an elaborate hoax.

Sharpton and his fellow liberals in the “mainstream media” are having a tough time lately. First, they were wrong about the Covington kids, and now they’ve conveyed false information about Jussie Smollett. Maybe they should actually verify the news before they lose whatever’s left of their credibility."

That led the always-loquacious Conway to reference embattled “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. “Yeah, it is, and I’ll tell you, whether it’s Jussie Smollett or Andrew McCabe, the media just loves to imbue credibility onto people if they bear anti-Trump gifts,” she fired back.

Cuomo, a pained expression on his face, responded: “I couldn’t think of two less analagous situations than that.”

Meanwhile, Smollett has been keeping a low profile ever since two Nigerian brothers were questioned by police, with the information they provided reportedly shifting the investigation into Smollett’s attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said a Chicago PD spokesperson amid reports the brothers claimed Smollett paid them to stage the attack. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a followup interview.”

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two Trump supporters late at night on Jan. 29 while walking to his Chicago home, alleging they placed a noose around his neck and attempted to pour some type of chemical substance on him while insulting him with homophobic slurs."

The ""Empire"" actor claimed that when he was walking home at 2 a.m. in Chicago, in the midst of the polar vortex, he was accosted by two assailants, both of whom shouted anti-gay and anti-black slurs at him. They then attempted to throw a noose around his neck and pour what he thought was bleach on him while shouting, ""This is MAGA country!"" he says.

None of this is true. Police now believe that Smollett paid two of his friends to stage the entire attack.

Why, exactly, would Smollett do it? He is a successful actor on a hit television show. He's been continuously working in Hollywood for years, with roles in the 2017 films ""Marshall"" and ""Alien: Covenant."" He's not exactly a textbook victim.

The answer to this question makes for some uncomfortable lessons.

First, alleged victims sometimes have an incentive to lie. For several years, each time an alleged victim tells an unverified and unverifiable story, we are told that we must believe that victim's story. Why? Because why would the victim lie? But this is often untrue. Smollett had an incentive to lie: unending media attention, fawning sycophancy from politicians and the potential for even greater Hollywood stardom. If Smollett had gotten away with his hoax, he'd be the face of gay, black suffering in the United States. Few had heard of Smollett before this story. Suddenly, he found himself on ""Good Morning America,"" telling the world about his own bravery. That's a lucrative career path.

Second, hoaxers can read the tea leaves. There's a reason that the most prominent racial and sexual hoaxes have generally flattered the political sensibilities of the political left. Right-wing hoaxes might catch the attention of right-wing sources, but left-wing sources are far more powerful and plentiful. Imagine if a MAGA-hatted young Republican had accused two young black men of assaulting him while shouting, ""F--- Trump!"" That story might get play on talk radio and Fox News, but it wouldn't earn one iota of attention from celebrity culture or the mainstream media.

Third, social media makes hoaxes infinitely easier. There are large-scale incentives for jumping on every story before the facts are clear, which is why both Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., both running for president, tweeted their support for Smollett ... and then had to backtrack radically, suggesting as the hoax emerged that they had to wait for more facts. Being the first to rip America bears political fruit; waiting for the whole story often earns public castigation for insufficient sensitivity.

All of this means that the hoaxes won't stop anytime soon. The incentives simply aren't aligned for hoaxes to end. Media members are too eager to buy into stories that support their preferred narratives; social media is too eager to engage in pile-ons of epic proportions; hoaxes are obviously eager to make a buck or win some fame. Which means that we should all wait next time we hear a story too good to be true.

But we won't. Nobody knows who the next Jussie Smollett will be. But within a few weeks, we'll surely know.

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett's absurd hate crime claims, few in the ""professional"" journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone's a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone's making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I'm especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I've chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

--Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" claiming she found a ""degrading"" noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried ""systematic racism,"" and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn't add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

--Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism -- until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted ""conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner."" Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

--University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a ""racist display"" of three ""noose-like objects"" hanging from trees. The UD president called it ""deplorable;"" protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the ""nooses"" were metal ""remnants of paper lanterns"" hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

--Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school's library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

--Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the ""noose"" was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who ""may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.""

--Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. ""A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,"" the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the ""noose"" was a ""packaged leather shoelace"" that someone had dropped accidentally.

--Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of ""nooses"" lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the ""latest in a string of hate incidents"" after Trump's election. The African-American museum director called them a ""reminder of America's dark history."" But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

--Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and ""hate signs"" found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett's folly, media sensationalists bluster that there's no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn't take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you've seen one social justice huckster, you've seen 'em all.

Most of the coverage regarding Smollett has centered around the attack itself, the aftermath, what he told police, what police now believe happened, and the alleged involvement of two Nigerian brothers reportedly paid by the actor to stage the assault.

But one facet of the evolving storyline that has escaped the attention of most Americans following along, as well as most news organizations reporting on this saga, is how it began in the first place: with a juvenile-looking letter sent to Fox studios addressed to Smollett.

As reported by CWB Chicago, someone dropped the letter into a mailbox in Chicago’s southwest suburbs on Jan. 18, several days before Smollett’s alleged hate crime took place and made national news.

The envelope containing the letter looked like a three-year-old had written it. It was sent to Smollett at Cinespace Studios, located on Chicago’s West Side where the program originates. “MAGA” — which stands for the president’s “Make America Great Again” 2016 campaign slogan — was written haphazardly in the return address space. Four days later, the website reported, the letter showed up at the studio and into Smollett’s hands.

“Something about the envelope must have raised concerns. Smollett would later tell police that he and Empire’s executive producer donned gloves before they opened it and exposed themselves to a threat letter covered in white powder. Police logged the time as 2:30 p.m.,” CBS Chicago reported.

The powder, it was determined later, turned out to be crushed Tylenol tablets. The letter, which featured words and letters cut out of a magazine, threatened Smollett using racial, homophobic language: “You will die black f*g.”

A week or so later is when Smollett initially reported the alleged attack to police, claiming he was beaten by two “MAGA” hat-wearing white males who poured a bleach-like substance on him, put a noose around his neck, and hollered, “This is MAGA country!” (Related: It’s now clear: Jussie Smollett and the Obama Left have set race relations back 100 years.)

Felonies were committed

But as Smollett was reporting the attack to Chicago PD, “a multi-agency federal investigation into the source of the threat letter was entering its seventh day,” the local news site reported.

That probe is being headed by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office and began, at least, as a terrorist threat investigation. The bureau is being assisted by personnel from the United States Postal Inspection Service, a serious law enforcement entity of the U.S. Postal Service founded by none other than American patriot Benjamin Franklin.

“Whoever sent the letter to Smollett may have considered the mail to be an untraceable way to deliver a message,” CWB Chicago reported. “They’d be mistaken.”

The USPS Inspection Service has a number of ways to track letters back to their source, but a modern technique involves technology: Cellphone tracking. Beyond that, other evidence is piling up.

The two Nigerian brothers whom police initially identified and picked up for questioning told investigators last week that Smollett planned the hate crime hoax because he was angry the threat letter didn’t get more attention.

Meanwhile, FBI and USPS agents have been trying to discover the origins of the threat letter for nearly a month, “giving it far more ‘attention’ than he knew,” CWB Chicago reports.

In a tweet, the news agency quoted a “very good” crime investigator who said, “This is not a whodunit. It’s a how-many-people-dunit.” The threat letter is a “direct” link to the alleged attack, the investigation source added.

Very good source on @JussieSmollett hate crime investigation: ""This is not a whodunit. It's a how-many-people-dunit."" Threat letter is a ""direct"" link to purported attack. #jussiesmollett #Chicago — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) February 11, 2019

Whoever mailed the threat letter “made an enormous mistake,” the news site was told, adding that their sources say federal charges are “certain.”

Per a legal (attorney) source: “If they have Smollett on the letter, he’ll be facing ‘terroristic hoax’ charges, a felony. There may be federal obstruction charges as well.”

“Tuesday the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office confirmed that in August of 2007 Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement,” CBS Chicago reported. “He was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail. Officials at the office could not confirm which Smollett chose. A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said the department was already aware of the plea.”

This latest revelation follows several significant developments over the last few days, and could end up impacting how prosecutors handle potential false report charges.

On Saturday, CBS Chicago reported that, according to law enforcement officials, new evidence suggested that Smollett orchestrated the January 29 attack on himself:

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the ‘Empire’ actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

On Monday, CBS Chicago reported that law enforcement officials had reason to believe that Smollett concocted the attack on himself because he was upset that a threatening letter he received the week before the attack did not get a “bigger reaction.”

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS Chicago.

On Tuesday, ABC News reported that the two brothers who allegedly staged the attack on Smollett indicated that Smollett was involved in sending the threatening letter to himself.

“The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at ‘Empire’s’ Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack,” ABC News reported, after confirming with two federal officials. “The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.”

The Daily Mail reported on Monday that hours before the alleged attack, Smollett reportedly participated in a play that was similar to the attack that he is accused of orchestrating.

“He had been in New York City for a reading of the play Take Me Out, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Smollett was being considered to appear in a possible revival of the Tony-winning production about a biracial baseball star who comes out as gay,” The Daily Mail reported. “The script for that play finds the lead character being attacked by a new pitcher who joins the team. That character uses the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‘f****t’ and ‘n****r.'”"

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday that she is recusing herself from the investigation.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have not further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

According to the Associated Press, however, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi dismissed the claim, noting that surveillance footage revealed it to be unfounded.

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men outside of a Subway restaurant early on the morning of January 29. He told police that his assailants shouted racist and homophobic taunts as they hit him, tied a noose around his neck and poured an unidentified liquid on him.

He has since faced allegations that he paid the two men to stage the attack and police are also reportedly looking into evidence that he sent himself a threatening letter days before reporting the attack.

A statement last week from Smollett’s attorneys echoed earlier comments and brushed off allegations in recent news reports.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

The two brothers at the center of the Jussie Smollett investigation told police that the Empire actor helped create the threatening letter he received at his studio, a week before the alleged attack, according to reports.

Unnamed law enforcement sources told ABC earlier this week that Smollett hired the two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, as part of the staged attack after the letter that he received on the set of Empire did not get a 'bigger reaction.'

The Chicago Police Department will not confirm on the record that they are treating the attack as a hoax and Smollett has not been arrested or charged.

On January 22, the Empire actor received an envelope containing a letter and white powder.

The stamped letter was addressed to Chicago's Cinespace Studios, where the popular Fox drama Empire is filmed.

When the white powder was discovered, HAZMAT crews were called to the scene, but the substance was later determined to be crushed aspirin.

The letter was scrawled with the words 'You will die black f*g', spelled out in cut and pasted magazine letters, and MAGA which was written in red pen.

Among items taken from the brothers' home during a raid last week was a magazine but it remains unclear if it is the same one the letters came from.

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident. No photographs of it emerged until after the alleged attack. He reported the letter to the police when he received it along with Empire producer Dennis Hammer

Brothers Abel (left) and Ola Osundairo (right) were released without charge last week after allegedly telling police Smollett paid them to perform the attack. They also reportedly told police that Smollett is the source of the letter and the pair are expected to testify against him

There was also a stick figure drawing of a man with a gun pointed at his head on the drawing.

Smollett and Empire producer Dennis Hammer both handled it with gloves while opening it before calling the police, leaked police reports into the incident reveal.

Chicago police also seized a book of stamps from one of the homes, according to the TV station.

The FBI and the United States Postal Service are now analyzing it.

Smollett did not post on social media about the letter and it was unknown until after the January 29 attack when a photograph of it appeared on That Grape Juice Net.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx has recused herself from the Smollett case, it was announced by her office on Tuesday. She said she wanted to step down because of her 'familiarity with potential witnesses' but did not say who those witnesses were

During a Good Morning America interview afterwards, Smollett confirmed he had received it, described it to host Robin Roberts then said: 'Did I make that up too?'

As more details of the investigation into the letter emerged on Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case because of her 'familiarity' with 'potential witnesses'.

It remains unclear who those potential witnesses are that could cloud her impartiality.

'Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,' Foxx's office said in a statement.

First Assistant State’s Attorney Joseph Magats will step in as acting state's attorney for the Smollett investigation.

Smollett claims he was assaulted while walking home from a local Subway at 2am on January 29.

Smollett alleged that the perpetrators tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

The attackers called him 'Empire f****t n****r', poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck, he said.

Jussie Smollett is pictured during his Good Morning America interview on Thursday where he described the threatening letter he received a week before being allegedly attacked and said: 'Did I make that up too?'

There is no footage of the attack, to Smollett's despair.

It has also emerged that in 2007, Smollett pleaded no contest to a California misdemeanor complaint.

Court records show he was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008."

""The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,"" said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. ""If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.""

The Empire star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett's co-stars and colleagues on Empire, celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett's account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Chicago police confirmed on Wednesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett's apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.

""It's a very, very, very serious situation,"" said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defence in Chicago. ""He's got some very significant exposure.""

Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2am, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was ""MAGA country,"" a reference to Donald Trump's campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the Empire set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record.

Update: NBC News reported Wednesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanour counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the LA City Attorney's office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.

Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.

""It's a very high-profile case,"" he said. ""Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody's watching. ... I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanour.""

Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defence attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanour, and not serve jail time.

""They're not going to ruin a guy's life over this,"" Greenberg said. ""People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, 'My car was stolen.' Ninety percent of the time, even if they're charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanour.""

Smollett has retained two criminal defence attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.

""His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defence,"" Turner said.

Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he's learned a lesson.

""If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,"" said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. ""Say you lied and you're sorry for that lie. Apologise to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that's near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.""

Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn't rush to judgement regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, ""too many unknown unknowns."" Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.

""He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,"" he said. ""He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologise. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there's no excuse, but there may be some explanation."""

Chicago’s local CBS affiliate, WBBM Channel 2, reports Smollett allegedly “orchestrated” the racist and homophobic assault on himself after the letter failed to evoke a large enough reaction.

The development comes after ABC News reported Tuesday that the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service officials are investigating whether Smollett was involved in the letter’s January 22 delivery. The letter, which contained powered aspired and the phrase “Die black fag,” is currently undergoing tests at an FBI crime lab.

Cops: Smollett Faked Attack After No Fuss Over Bigoted Letter https://t.co/Tbj9NMDvyJ pic.twitter.com/dLKMevPpl2 — RCInvestigations (@RCInvestigates) February 19, 2019

In a statement to CNN, Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that a HAZMAT team had been sent to Cinespace Studios, where the show was being filmed, upon the letter’s discovery.

Police are seeking to re-question Smollett amid allegations that he staged the attack with the brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — who were extras on Empire. Anna Kavanagh, a press representative for Smollett, said Monday that the actor has no plans to meet with police and that his lawyers would keep an “active dialogue” going with authorities on his behalf.

On Saturday evening, CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported that at least one of the brothers was directed by Smollett to purchase the rope at the Crafty Beaver hardware store, and he and his brother were paid $3,500 and promised an additional $500 later.

Smollett, who is gay and African-American, told police that two masked men had doused him with an unknown chemical substance as they spewed racist and anti-gay insults at him. The actor also claimed that his attackers had looped a thin rope around his neck and screamed “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the area.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office confirmed to NBC News that Smollett had pleaded no contest to driving under the influence and driving without a license, along with providing false information to law enforcement in 2007. The actor was sentenced to probation for two years and given a choice to pay a fine or serve jail time, NBC News 10 reported.

Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Company, the network behind Empire, will keep Smollett on as a series regular, according to a report. “Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d,” TMZ reported."

NBC News reports that the “Empire” actor was convicted in 2007 of, among other things, providing false information to law enforcement:

As the police investigation into the alleged attack against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett continues, it was revealed Tuesday that in 2007 Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement, the L.A. City Attorney’s office confirmed to NBC News. Smollett, now 36, was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail in the 2007 case, an L.A. City Attorney’s spokesman told NBC News. The case is coming to light as Chicago police investigate whether Smollett made up a story about being the victim of a racially, motivated hate crime. Chicago police have requested LAPD provide them information about the 2007 arrest, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar the investigation.

Fox 32 Chicago‘s Rafer Weigel confirmed this information with the L.A. city attorney as well:

LA City attorney confirms to @fox32news #JussieSmollett in Aug ‘07 entered no contest to 3 misdeameanor counts driving w/ blood alcohol of .08 or above, no valid drivers license and providing false information to law enforcement. He

was sentenced to 2 years probation. #Smollett — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 19, 2019

No specifics were given on what the “false information” was, but the shorter version of this is that Smollett LIED to police in that case, just as it appears he lied to them about the “attack” he said happened to him on Jan. 29th.

Weigel also tweeted:

#CPD says they’re hearing “whispers” that #JussieSmollett has made a change in legal representation but no one has given them any official word of that. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 20, 2019

This is on top of reports earlier, noted by Red State‘s Alex Parker, that the two Nigerian brothers who are alleged to have been the “perps” in Smollett’s apparent attack hoax told investigators that Smollett himself sent the threatening letter to the “Empire” set on Jan. 22nd.

Smollett’s week has gone from bad to worse. The world’s tiniest violin is playing for ya, buddy.

The latest news out of Chicago reported by ABC is that the two Nigerian-American brothers, who have been “fully cooperating” with police after being detained last week, say that not only did Smollett pay them to stage the “racist and homophobic” attack, Smollett sent the infamous threatening letter to himself a couple of weeks earlier. To make matters worse, multiple outlets have confirmed that Smollett was found guilty of providing false information to police involving a DUI back in 2007.

So, if these widely reported claims about Smollett turn out to be true, how serious are the potential charges he would face? Some legal experts have begun to weigh in on the issue.

Speaking with Variety, Chicago-based criminal defense lawyer Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor, suggested that Smollett’s “significant exposure” could end up coming back to haunt him if authorities press charges. “It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” he said.

Filing a false police report is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, Variety reports, carrying the potential of one to three years in prison. While some false reports are reduced to a misdemeanor, the high-profile nature of the case, the extensive and costly investigation, and Smollett’s 2007 false report charge may end up prompting the state to push for prison time.

Former Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prosecutor Andrew Weisberg echoed Turner’s suggestion that all the publicity surrounding the case would likely end up making things “tougher” on the actor. “It’s a very high-profile case,” Weisberg told Variety. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching,” he said, adding that he thinks they may “come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

The growing costs of the already extensive investigation may also end up coming out of the actor’s pocket if the report is proven to be false, the outlet notes.

But falsifying a police report is not the only crime potentially at play in the case. According to ABC News, federal investigators are now looking into unconfirmed claims by the two brothers allegedly involved in the incident that Smollett sent a letter to himself weeks earlier containing racist death threats and a white powder (crushed painkiller tablets). The brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, reportedly told police that Smollett orchestrated the attack with them because he was upset the letter didn’t prompt a “bigger reaction” from the media.

“The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at ‘Empire’s’ Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack, two federal officials confirm to ABC News,” the network reported Tuesday. “The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.”

The prospect of a federal case, said constitutional attorney and Daily Wire editor-at-large Josh Hammer, could significantly “escalate” the situation. “The last thing that Smollett would want is the Feds to get involved,” Hammer told The Daily Wire. “If in fact he did commit mail fraud and prosecutors were to pursue charges — which seems quite possible given the high-profile nature of the case — Smollett’s legal situation would escalate significantly.”

Mail fraud penalties vary widely but can be significant, including lengthy prison sentences (up to 20 years) and fines of up to $250,000 for a single count.

Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the department, tweeted that the tip alleging that Smollett was spotted in an elevator in his building with two men who were initially considered suspects was ""unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.""

Smollett, who is openly gay and black, reported that on Jan. 29, he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told WLS-TV that a someone who lives in Smollett’s building or was visiting a resident at the time said they saw the three men together the night of January 29. Guglielmi said they haven’t corroborated the tipster’s claim, revealing that they plan to interview them on Tuesday.

Reports indicated that Smollett, 35, flew out of New York and landed in Chicago around midnight. The actor reportedly claimed two masked men attacked him outside of the Chicago eatery about two hours later.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, reportedly told police that two masked assailants asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” moments before the assault. He allegedly said the suspects then tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid on him before fleeing the scene.

Law enforcement initially identified Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo as suspects and took them into custody last week before releasing them. An official source who spoke with ABC News said the brothers—who were reportedly extras on the hit Fox series—claimed Smollett paid them to stage the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter sent to him a week earlier didn’t get more media attention.

Jussie’s lawyers denied allegations that the actor orchestrated his own attack in the following statement:

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.



Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

A 1971 Playboy interview featuring John Wayne's comments on race and sexuality have stirred a fresh debate. https://t.co/0kaHoNXCGm — Twitter Moments (@TwitterMoments) February 19, 2019

The Mercury News write-up of the controversy described it as a “heated Twitter debate” and part of the “latest culture war…” (High drama!)

The paper also helpfully provided some excerpts:

In the Playboy interview, Wayne, fresh off his Oscar win for “True Grit,” discussed a range of topics, from working in Hollywood to race and sex. One of the more noteworthy quotes in the interview came up in a discussion about African-American political activist and academic Angela Davis. “With a lot of blacks, there’s quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so,” Wayne said. “But we can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.” Later in the interview, Wayne also said he didn’t feel “guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago (black) people were slaves.” Wayne continued: “Now, I’m not condoning slavery. It’s just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can’t play football with the rest of us.”

A full transcript of the nearly 50-year-old interview can be read here.

This is actually one of the most well-known and controversial celebrity interviews ever done, so why exactly has it become “a thing” in 2019? Media Research Center‘s Brittany Hughes gets right to the heard of it:

Then again, perhaps the Jussie Smollett Deflection Committee could try a little harder.

Yes. As always, when the heat gets too hot, liberals must deploy the “DEFLECT! DEFLECT!” option.

With that in mind, and in no particular order, here’s my list of the top 10 responses to the liberal fauxtrage machine:

Errr…. probably not.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also immediately rushed to judgment and posted a sympathetic tweet about the “attack” on Twitter. Now more than two weeks later, as evidence has emerged that suggests the “hate crime” was nothing more than a hoax, Pelosi has deleted her initial tweet.

The Daily Caller reported that mere hours after the story about Smollett initially broke, Pelosi tweeted, “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

Pelosi’s tweet added, “I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

Smollett claimed that he was physically and verbally assaulted by two men wearing ski masks around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he walked home from a nearby Subway restaurant in the middle of the recent sub-zero “polar vortex” weather event.

He further claimed the alleged assailants had berated him with homophobic and racist insults, tied a rope noose around his neck and doused him in some sort of chemical while shouting “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The Chicago Police Department immediately launched a full investigation of the alleged hate crime and began reviewing surveillance camera footage in the area and searching for witnesses to the attack. Police eventually settled in on two Nigerian brothers as the prime suspects in the assault and arrested them.

However, when faced with evidence of their involvement in the alleged crime, the brothers reportedly cooperated with investigators and told them that Smollett — who had befriended the brothers when they appeared as extras on “Empire” — had paid them to help him stage the attack on himself.

They have since been released with no charges filed against them, and the police have announced that Smollett is no longer being viewed as a “victim” in their continuing investigation.

As noted, Pelosi was just one of a number of prominent figures who rushed to pass judgment on a dubious story that fit the left’s prevailing “Trump is bad and his supporters are racists” narrative — a narrative that has now been undermined by new information that suggests the whole incident was a staged hoax designed to garner sympathy and attention for Smollett.

Whether Pelosi deleted her initial take on the Smollett claims or had left them up unchanged — like many others who immediately weighed in have done — is really beside the point. What actually matters is what Pelosi has to say about the situation now that it has been revealed as most likely being a hoax.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear as though the speaker has offered up a new or revised view of the incident, and it is unlikely that the liberal media — many of whom also uncritically accepted Smollett’s initial claims at face value — will ask her about her now-deleted tweet or how she feels about the fabricated hate crime that only stirred up more racial controversy in an already sharply divided nation.

We will nevertheless patiently wait for an updated tweet from Pelosi or a response to reporters’ questions about the current developments, though we certainly won’t hold our breath.

In the meantime, the fact that Pelosi deleted her tweet supporting Smollett signals bad news for Smollett, as he is now left twirling in the wind with no support as Chicago authorities weigh whether to press charges against him for filing a false report and wasting valuable law enforcement resources on his crime.

It would be nice if Pelosi, among many others, would publicly own up to her mistaken rush to judgment, rather than just ignore the dramatic shift in this controversial story that will only highlight the left’s overtly partisan hackery when it comes to smearing President Trump and his supporters at any given opportunity.

Update: Police have dismissed the tip that Jussie Smollett and the two brothers initially arrested in connection with the attack were together in an elevator.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven't confirmed the person's account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Amid the ongoing controversy surrounding actor Jussie Smollett, two of his siblings are criticizing the media for raising doubts about whether the actor was the victim of a hate crime or, perhaps, whether he staged the whole thing.

Smollett, 36, told police that he was attacked by two unidentified men while leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. However, his story has recently come under scrutiny after media reports emerged suggesting he may have had a hand in planning the attack. For his part, the “Empire” actor maintains that he was the victim of a hate crime and two of his siblings, actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett, took to Instagram early Tuesday to critique the media, seemingly in response to the continued criticism.

Both shared images of a quote attributed to Malcolm X, which reads, “This is the media, the irresponsible media. It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal. If you aren’t careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”

Jocqui also posted a tweet that supports Jussie’s claim.

“I have a feeling even if we had video of Jussie being attacked...y’all would still discredit him. Because it’s easier to believe what aligns with your contempt for survivors of hate crimes, sexual abuse, etc who happen to be LGBTQ+, disabled, or women,” it reads.

Smollett’s family previously released a statement supporting him soon after the alleged attack, calling it a “racial and homophobic hate crime.” The actor initially told police that the two men left a noose around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country,” during the encounter. He then reportedly transported himself to a hospital where he was treated for minor injuries. The incident has been under investigation, but authorities say that they have since been unable to locate any footage of the alleged attack.

Chicago police arrested two men - identified by multiple outlets as Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo - on Wednesday who they believe were captured on video in the vicinity of the attack that night. While initially considered as possible suspects in the attack, the brothers, who reportedly worked with Smollett on “Empire,” were released without charges two days later after police discovered “new evidence,” according to CNN, citing law enforcement sources. Those sources say police now believe Smollett paid the brothers to carry out the attack, according to the outlet.

Police have discovered proof that the brothers purchased the rope used to form the noose Smollett said his attackers left around his neck, according to CNN. As for Smollett’s alleged motive, the brothers reportedly told police that the actor staged the attack because he felt a threatening letter he'd received had gotten enough attention, according to ABC7 in Chicago. The men said that Smollett paid them for their involvement, according to the outlet. Police are reportedly no longer considering the two brothers as suspects in the case.

Smollett has maintained his innocence, with his attorneys saying in a statement that the actor was “devastated” to learn that his attackers were people he was familiar with.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” their statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

One of the brothers interviewed by police is a personal trainer who Smollett hired to help him prepare for a music video, according to a statement from Smollett’s attorneys.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” they said.

While police have not confirmed that Smollett had anything to do with the alleged attack, they are seeking a follow-up interview with the actor, which has not yet happened. Chicago PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi did say Tuesday that authorities were investigating a tip that Smollett was seen in the elevator of his apartment building the night of the incident with the two brothers who were later arrested and released.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quietly deleted a supportive tweet. Cory Booker, who previously called the attack an “attempted modern-day lynching,” declined to comment on new developments, as did Kamala Harris. “I think the facts are still unfolding, and I’m very concerned,” she told a reporter at a New Hampshire town hall, after taking several painfully long seconds to formulate a response. (Smollett, whose case went before a grand jury on Tuesday, maintains his innocence, while his alleged attackers have been released by police.)

Conservatives seized on the awkwardness, with many baldly vindicated at Smollett’s seeming duplicity, and incensed that his story had been leveraged to bash Trump and his supporters. “The reason [the right] is dunking on media pundits and activists masquerading as journalists over this [is] because it shows just how full of shit this new era of ‘facts-first journalism’ is,” said Stephen L. Miller, a conservative media columnist. “We know there are no consequences for Harris or Booker calling this a lynching. We know there will be no apology from Ellen Page or Stephen Colbert.”

This may be an oversimplification. After all, expressions of sympathy are far different from reportorial inquiry. And the mainstream media’s very investigation into the matter, however delinquent, is proof of a commitment to nonpartisan truth-telling. Nevertheless, many right-wing pundits remain aggrieved and frustrated by the matter, seemingly viewing it as proof that different standards of veracity apply to anti-Trump coverage than pro-Trump reporting. “There was no conservative angle,” said the influential conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. “I mean, people were hoping the story was true, and then they could jump on Republicans for not having been quick enough to embrace the story. That’s what happened here. And that’s a bad tendency. The story itself was not supremely credible from the very first. It was perfectly tailored to fit a narrative. And maybe it was true, and maybe it wasn’t. But when a story is that perfectly tailored to fit a narrative”—there were initially reports floating around that the assailants were wearing MAGA hats—“you have to start asking whether it was actually filled in to fit the narrative.”

The Smollett episode, of course, is also a window into a complementary phenomenon on the right, specifically an ever-simmering resentment at being labeled the party of bigotry, or racial grievance, or discrimination, which many conservatives reject as a form of discrimination itself. The opportunity to take the rare, public victory lap, then, was irresistible for some. As Quillette editor Andy Ngo noted in an extensive Twitter thread, conservative writers and journalists have been keeping tabs on fabricated hate crimes for years, most notably the Duke lacrosse scandal and the U.V.A.-Rolling Stone affair. The Covington Catholic High School fracas, in which a white male teenager faced off in a video against a Native American activist, quickly devolved into a political version of Rashomon, in which several prominent pundits ultimately apologized for rushing to judgment.

But the Smollett case was one of the most egregious examples that Ngo had observed to date. “He is a well-connected celebrity and political activist—in other words, very privileged... His celebrity friends are numerous,” Ngo told me in an e-mail. “The influencer ecosystem was able to amplify his fake story to millions and millions of people across the globe.” Daily Beast senior columnist Matt Lewis, formerly of the Daily Caller, made a similar point. “Victim status [has become] the pinnacle of moral authority” in the culture, he told me. “It’s not surprising to me that people are treating themselves as victims specifically, or members of a victim class. So I think that conservatives are cognizant of media confirmation bias, and the desire for people to get attention, and to treat themselves as beyond reproach.”"

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning against buying young people's blood in an attempt to fight aging and other diseases.

""Simply put, we're concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors as cures and remedies,"" the FDA said in a statement on Tuesday.

For example, a company called Ambrosia charges $8,000 for people to receive an infusion of blood from young people.

While not naming any company, the FDA said ""such treatments have no proven clinical benefits for the uses for which these clinics are advertising them and are potentially harmful.""

""There are reports of bad actors charging thousands of dollars for infusions that are unproven and not guided by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials,"" the agency added.

Harris: Medicare for all is not socialism

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Tuesday said ""Medicare for all"" is not a socialist idea.

""No, no. It's about providing health care to all people,"" Harris said in an interview with NBC News.

Harris, a progressive presidential candidate who has embraced Medicare for all, told NBC that rising costs are making health care unaffordable, and she wants to provide universal access to health care.

""It's about understanding that access to affordable health care should not be a privilege, it should be a right. It's about understanding that in a democracy, and the way we have constructed our democracy, we at least in concept have said that your access to public education, public health or public safety should not be a function of how much money you have,"" Harris said.

Last month, Harris attracted headlines when she told a CNN town hall she wants to eliminate private insurance in an effort to move fully toward Medicare for all.

Patients and health groups are accusing Facebook of exposing the personal health data of users

A group of patients and health data experts is accusing Facebook of misleading users about how their personal health information can be manipulated and exposed without patients' explicit permission.

In a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint released publicly on Tuesday, the group alleges that Facebook prompts its users to join online medical support groups under the guise that they are ""private"" – but does not make clear that users could expose their health data when they join.

The claims: For example, if Facebook's algorithms suspect that a user is pregnant, the platform may prompt that user to join a pregnancy support group. Though many of those groups are advertised by their administrators as ""private,"" ""anonymous"" or ""confidential,"" the data shared in those groups can be shared with third parties.

Kaiser medical school in California to offer free tuition to first five classes of students

California-based health-care company Kaiser Permanente announced Tuesday that it will provide free tuition to the first five classes of students who attend its new medical school in Pasadena, Calif.

The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine plans to begin offering classes in the summer of 2020 after recently receiving its preliminary accreditation.

The first five graduating classes at the school will have their entire four-year tuition waived, the company announced.

Students will then go on to do their clinical work at hospitals and clinics in the Kaiser Permanente network.

Students can begin applying for the school this June.

""The school will help shape the future of medical education and train physicians for medical excellence and the total health of their patients,"" Kaiser Permanente Chairman and CEO Bernard Tyson said in a press release Tuesday.

In the latest twist of this curious hate crime, Chicago police claim they received a tip that the Empire star and the two Nigerian brothers he allegedly hired to carry out the attack were spotted together in an elevator the night of the incident, Complex reports.

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, have allegedly told investigators that they were recruited by Smollett to help orchestrate the crime.

CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released a statement Tuesday dismissing a tip that Smollett and the accomplices were in an elevator in the building on the same night of the attack, according to The Associated Press.

While the witness’s claims will surely fuel speculation that Smollett staged the incident, Guglielmi has now made clear that the tip about the trio being seen together in an elevator was “unfounded.”

It was not the first time police dismissed rumors in the case. On Feb 17, Guglielmi wrote on Twitter: “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

But in a follow up tweet two days later he noted: “CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.”

It usually happens once a leftist goes social justice and pulls some kind of stunt in the name of self-aggrandizement and is subsequently caught. We’re currently awaiting the Jussie Smollett defenders to pick up the torch, but until then, here are a few examples.

Take Emma Sulkowicz, formerly of Columbia University, who lied about being raped. Seeing no evidence that it happened — and in fact, finding evidence to the contrary — Sulkowicz made herself into a public victim by carrying around the mattress she was supposedly raped on wherever she went. The story was, of course, false, but if you were to ask various media outlets and SJW circles, Sulkowicz “sparked an important conversation” or “began a dialogue” about rape on campus.

In 2016, three black women from the University at Albany claimed they were attacked by a bus full of white men who were yelling racist slurs at them. The University went into meltdown mode with protests and even garnered a condemnation by Hillary Clinton. Only it was all fake. In fact, the women were the aggressors. The excuse? “We needed her to get that conversation started, so it wasn’t a waste of time,” said one student.

Mari Poindexter, a gay Central Michigan University professor claimed a man at a Toby Keith concert called her a “cross-dressing fag” before punching her in the eye, which she later displayed to be blackened on social media along with her story. Naturally, it caused outrage throughout the nation.

The real story is that Poindexter punched herself in the eye, and court documents stated that she claimed to have done it “because she wanted to raise awareness about the social hardships of people in the LGBTQ+ community.”

After the UVA rape hoax was discovered to be a fake, social justice advocates like MTV immediately dismissed its falseness, stating that the destructive lie that hurt many innocent people “may have unintentionally started a conversation that’s bigger than the controversy itself.”

As night follows day, the “it started a conversation” excuse appears when the left’s back is against the wall and their position on the moral high ground is threatened. In order to maintain their position as the arbiters of all that is fair and good, they and their supporters will publicly pat themselves on the back for supposedly making people more aware of a problem that was hitherto unspoken.

The only problem is that these problems are oftentimes not the widespread problem they claim it is. During the height of the campus rape “conversation”, we got the “1 in 5 girls on campus will be sexually assaulted” figure. As TIME pointed out, this number is very misleading. The “racism” conversation we’re supposed to be having is up against the fact that America isn’t even racist as Greg Jones at The Federalist highlights in detail.

The “conversation” the left wants us to have is based on pure, sick fantasy. It’s “dialogue” where the subject of discussion is “everything the left claims is happening in our nation is true and you need to accept it.” It’s odd that every “dialogue” or “conversation” we’re supposed to have as a nation always includes the same set of people as the villains and the same groups as the victims.

Broken down, it’s not even a “conversation,” it’s a one-sided narrative. That’s what the left is proud of kicking up whenever their lie is exposed.

Translated, “at least it started a conversation” is some kind of real-world newspeak for “at least my lie permeated a false sense of reality and my narrative has gotten more footholes in the minds of the public.”"

Things aren’t going so well at the moment in the culture wars? You went all in on a hate crime that turned out to be a hoax? Your dignified Indian elder Marine veteran wasn’t much of a veteran and the Covington kids did nothing to him? How about the minstrel show in the Virginia Capital?

Take heart, progressives. You can dig up an American icon and knock him down cost-free and with no risk he’ll defend himself!

Jussie Smollett’s story may have been fiction, but John Wayne was real and he was conservative. Therefore, he can be vilified. It doesn’t matter that the Duke rode off into the sunset in 1979 -- why not pour a bit of your perpetual outrage in the Wayback Machine and head over to Twitter for some gasping about....a 48 year old interview with the star.

Desperate for something to distract from Smollett, lefties found a new target: John Wayne. Specifically a 1971 interview Wayne did with Playboy.

The Twitter tempest began with a tweet by Matt Williams, a non-verified user. This story was promptly picked up by multiple liberal media outlets and became a trending Twitter moment.

It was elevated two days after it began as a trending Twitter Moment, commenting that “John Wayne's comments on race and sexuality have stirred a fresh debate.” Cultural commentators like film writers Scott Weinberg and Joe Carnahan, as well as comedian Patton Oswalt also hopped on the bandwagon to disparage this American icon.

Some more obscure Twitter uses seemed more incredulous that the interview was gaining so much notoriety today, user Esoteric Jeff commented “Is John Wayne seriously trending on Twitter because some rando rediscovered the 1971 Playboy interview? It's infamous! It's one of the most talked about celebrity interviews in history! How do you ‘rediscover’ it? It's like ‘rediscovering’ the John Lennon Playboy interview.”

Boston College lecturer-in-law Elliot Hamilton responded by tweeting that the Left does this because “when one of their sources of moral outrage gets exposed as a hoax, they have to keep the perpetually outraged preoccupied with something to pound their chest over.” He then added a barb towards the tech establishment that propped it up “See through the mirage and tell @jack to stop stoking it through this crap.”

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire added his own tweets to the fray, “So it appears people are randomly getting offended about some comments John Wayne made in an interview half a century ago… John Wayne was born in 1907. Breaking news, folks: every human born in 1907 or earlier had opinions you would find abhorrent today.”

Normally, liberals pull down statues when they get frustrated, but that takes time and energy, and the Smollett sore is stinging right now. The Duke will do in a pinch."

But there are serious questions as to how effective such attacks will be, given that polling indicates a broadening popularity for ideas that were once on the left fringes of American politics.

Fifty-four percent — a clear majority — of adults nationwide who were surveyed for a CNN–SSRS poll conducted in late January and early February support a government-provided national health insurance program. An even higher percentage — 59 percent of the registered voters polled in a mid-January The Hill–HarrisX survey — favored increasing the highest income tax rate to 70 percent. A Reuters–IPSOS poll last summer indicated that 60 percent of respondents — including 41 percent of Republicans — supported a tax on speculative trading to provide free college tuition for those who meet certain income levels.

Then there are the particular dynamics within the Democratic Party.

A Gallup poll last summer showed 57 percent of Democratic respondents have a positive view of socialism, as against only 47 percent who have a positive view of capitalism.

Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in a primary last June. To activists on the left, it is a sign that the zeitgeist has shifted in their favor — and that politicians such as Sanders should no longer be considered unelectable on a national scale.

“The New Deal was ‘socialist,’ Social Security was ‘socialist,’ Medicare was ‘socialist,’ President Obama’s health care reform was ‘socialist,’ ” said Waleed Shahid, the communications director of the Justice Democrats, a group founded by former Sanders staffers. “Given that decades-long fear-mongering about socialism — and especially the way Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump says Obama may have committed treason Biden still has a Hispanic voter problem, but does it matter? This week: Congress set for showdown on police reform legislation MORE had that label put on him — I just don’t think voters are going to be very responsive to that kind of message.”

Another Democratic strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said even Sanders’s unflinching democratic socialism “is a very American vision of the role of government. Its antecedents are in the ideas of Franklin Roosevelt, not Karl Marx.”

Be that as it may, Republicans can barely suppress their glee about the launch of Sanders’s candidacy, seeing in it a chance not only to hit the veteran Vermonter but also to paint the Democratic Party more broadly as beyond the pale.

“Run, Bernie, Run!” Matt Gorman, the former communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said with a laugh. “Not only does he get to the left of the Democratic candidates in a primary, but he also really motivates Republicans in a huge way. And he pulls the entire [Democratic] field to the left.”

“Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,” the statement, from Trump 2020 national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, said. “But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.”

Some party insiders are also eager to separate out attitudes to progressive policies from attitudes to Sanders himself.

Sanders is still the subject of considerable enmity in some Democratic circles because of his campaign against Clinton in 2016, which many strategists argue hurt her in the general election against Trump.

“I don’t remember another candidate who comes with as much opposition as Bernie does,” said Simon Rosenberg, the president of NDN, a center-left group.

“There are an awful lot of Democrats who are not supporting Bernie, and the opposition to him will be apparent, and will become obvious in the coming days,” Rosenberg added. “Up to this point, the primary has been pretty good-natured, and I think that is all going to change.”

Rosenberg also insisted that the shift of the party to the left had been exaggerated. He noted that there were a number of more centrist candidates who won seats in Congress in last November’s midterm elections.

Referring to the two most recent Democratic presidents, Rosenberg added: “Obama and [Bill] Clinton were far more pragmatists than ideologues.

“One of the things that I think people are missing is that if Democrats are looking for an alternative to Trump, then one clear alternative is being not so ideological, more pragmatic, and being willing to work with people on both sides to get things done.”

Trump himself was a good deal milder about Sanders than some Republicans.

“Personally I think he missed his time … but I like Bernie,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday.

Such politeness would likely go out the window if Sanders were to become the Democratic nominee — but even the primary itself will reveal plenty about where America stands on socialism.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, the “Empire” star said last month that he was attacked by two men outside of a Subway restaurant, beaten and left with a noose around his neck. That claim has opened him up to allegations that he paid the men to orchestrate an attack.

Smollett’s claims of the Chicago, Illinois, attack, came on the heels of a threatening letter he claimed had been addressed to him via the television series’ studio in Chicago.

Two brothers arrested as part of the investigation and later released without charge reportedly told police that the actor also staged that incident, according to two federal officials cited by ABC News.

The sources indicate that the allegation is being investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI. Reports show the letter was sent to a federal crime lab for analysis, though the brothers’ claims had not been verified by authorities as of the latest updates available.

In recent statements, representatives for Smollett have described him as cooperative in the investigation and dismiss claims he helped stage any part of the alleged attacks.

Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said the actor “is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

The attorney statement went on to claim Smollett has been “further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” adding that nothing could be “further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Ola and Abel Osundairo have claimed the three rehearsed the attack before it was acted out on a Chicago street. But what of — I asked — the threatening letter to Jussie, which supposedly served as catalyst for the staged fight (here)?

On January 22nd, the Empire actor received a letter featuring a stick figure hanging from a tree, with a gun to his head and a caption reading “You will die, black fag.”

As the Monday story went, detectives believe the letter didn’t get a satisfactory degree of attention for Jussie, so he conjured a media’s-dream-come-true tale.

But was the letter his doing as well? The Osundairo brothers now say Yes.

As stated by ABC News:

The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at Empire’s Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack, two federal officials confirm to ABC News. The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.

What kind of person longs for this level of attention? Who’d wanna fake a bunch of stuff in order to have a spotlight shined on them? Oh, yeah — an actor.

It seems that Jussie’s account continues to collapse. The walls of reality are closing in, if investigators and the accomplice brothers are to be believed. So far, Ola and Abel appear to be singing like canaries:

The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope — allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs — at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.

Makes sense.

The Left went bananas over Jussie’s claim — immediately gripping their pearls, despite the lack of story verification. For that, see Stephanie Ruhle in the video below.

But Jussie’s yarn is merely one of many. For more on that, check out Elizabeth Vaughn’s RedState article covering other MAGAmongering stories since Trump’s election. This incident is part of a greater series. And — given the fact that the media learned nothing from the Covington fiasco — it isn’t a succession likely to soon end. With hasty outrage and irresponsible reporting, the Left are using lies — whether intentional or not — to construct an anti-conservative narrative the size of…an Empire.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he fucked up Black History Month,” the 26-year-old rapper, who is rarely shy about her thoughts, shared Monday on her Instagram in a live video, per Page Six.

“I’m not going to say until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged,” she added. “I don’t want to completely blame him because, you know, like somebody that was talking too, they said like police in Chicago are racist.”

The rapper continued, “So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then, bro, you fucked up for real.”

“And why would you do that?” Cardi B explained. “Then you give fucking Donald Trump immunity to laugh at n—-s and shit, to make motherfuckers look bad. This shit crazy, girl.”

It all comes following several reports Monday that the investigation into Smollett’s alleged attack had “shifted” and that police reportedly believe he might have paid two men—who were arrested and released with no charges—to stage the attack.

Other reports emerged about a possible motive for the actor claiming he was attacked by two men near his Chicago home last month. At the time, police said he told them the suspects yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him while mentioning “MAGA”(Make America Great Again). Smollett claimed the two people also threw a rope around his neck and poured a bleach-like chemical on him."

We hope you had a great President’s Day. Over the long weekend, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) officially announced he was running for president. This was expected. He had a video package primed. He had a better-than-expected 2016 run. He garnered the adoration of the young voter bloc, a key constituency in the Obama coalition, so this was going to happen. As the Democrats lurch to the Left with a socialist platform, a solid majority of Americans are rejecting the odious philosophy, along with feelings that the government should leave people alone.

Yet, the main course of the day, and possible over the next week or so, is the alleged stunt that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett pulled in Chicago on January 29. It was initially reported as a possible hate crime. Two white men assaulted him, poured bleach on him, hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, and then put a rope around his neck.

Smollett is a Trump critic. He’s gay. He’s black. People connected the dots, as instructed by actress Ellen Page, and everyone, once again, was flat-out wrong; Page actually blamed Vice President Mike Pence for the assault that is looking more like a total hoax. It's another classic example of Trump-era hysteria from the Left. First, the assailants were not white, but two Nigerian brothers. One of them was an extra on “Empire,” while the other was the actor’s former personal trainer. They were allegedly paid to ‘attack’ Smollett, they bought the rope used in the so-called attack, and they allege that there were rehearsals prior to the January 29 incident.

What's more, is that there are reports that the so-called assault mirrored that of a plot for a play Smollett had auditioned for (via PageSix):

Jussie Smollett auditioned for a role in a play that shares eerie similarities to his alleged attack — and he may have used Instagram to tip off the brothers to his whereabouts the night of the beat-down, according to a report on Monday. In the hours before the violent Jan. 29 assault in Chicago, the “Empire” star was in New York City for a day of readings for a possible revival of “Take Me Out,” sources told the Daily Mail. The Tony-winning production follows a biracial baseball player who is attacked by a pitcher — and called a “n—-r” and “f—-t” — after coming out. The characters compete on a team called the New York Empires. Smollett was among actors, including Zachary Quinto, to perform two readings that day, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. Afterward, he popped to La Guardia Airport to fly back to Chicago to film the final episodes of the fourth season of “Empire.” But when the flight got delayed, Smollett began posting Instagram stories — which cops now believe were meant for brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to see ahead of the attack, a source told the Mail.

The case is now going to a grand jury, where Smollett could be charged with filing a false police report. The entire investigation has changed, and the liberal media is eating another healthy helping of crow. The liberal media tried to absolve themselves by saying that celebrity-based news media peddled the story. Not the case; reporters and writers for Newsweek, Reuters, Slate, Huffington Post, and the LA Times all pushed this story that set off another firestorm that could very well be fake news. Also, this wouldn’t be the first time we had to deal with a fake hate crime hoax.

.@KamalaHarris's face and pause when asked about her previous tweet that the attack on Jussie Smollett was a ""modern-day lynching"" is something to behold

On the Hill, Democrats running for president, like Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), were asked about the Smollett affair. Harris looked like a deer in the headlights, while Booker said he’s waiting for all the facts. Funny since both thought the attack was a modern day lynching just days before. On top of this, Booker said that the Green New Deal’s price tag of $7 trillion, which I say is a low-ball figure, isn’t right. An end of all fossil fuels within a decade, the upgrading of all U.S. buildings to energy standards, and the end of farting cows. And this is on top of Democrats' universal job guarantee, free college, and Medicare for All ventures. The latter is projected to cost over $30 trillion in the first ten years. It’s a mighty left-wing mess.

On a lighter note, we have deer with a zombie-like virus that turns you into a drooling vegetable, prompting the CDC to issue warnings. There is no cure if you contract this virus. Micah ate some venison, so we could have a producer position opening up soon. The sailor featured in the iconic photo, where he’s kissing a nurse upon the end of the Second World War, has passed away at the age of 95.

Other than that, Trump is facing another legal challenge to his emergency declaration, as expected. We’ll have more on that Thursday."

Still, this ABC News report is more evidence that he is now the focus of the investigation.

The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at “Empire’s” Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack, two federal officials confirm to ABC News. The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.

So this is another story coming from the Nigerian brothers. They’re saying the hate mail was also part of the hoax and now the feds are looking to either confirm or disprove that.

Yesterday CBS 2 in Chicago reported that the brothers claimed Smollett himself had concocted the street attack after a previous hate mail story didn’t have the impact he was hoping for. That combined with the fact that police had seized stamps and magazines (from which the cut-out letters used to create the hate mail may have come) suggested police were already looking to see if the letter was also part of the hoax. Now we know why they were looking.

Of course, this is all still an ongoing investigation and the brother’s story hasn’t been confirmed yet. But Jussie Smollett is definitely resisting making any more statements to police. CNN reports police want to talk to him but don’t know when or if it will happen:

Chicago detectives want to speak to actor Jussie Smollett — but it’s not clear when, or if, that will happen. Police want to ask Smollett additional questions about the attack he reported on January 29, but as of Tuesday morning, Smollett’s attorneys had not indicated when their client will be available to talk to police.

Maybe he’s just being prudent or maybe he realizes he’s facing some serious repercussions from a stunt he initiated. As I noted earlier, there’s also a report that he may be hiring a big-time defense attorney. Variety has a report today on Jussie’s future if it turns out he staged this crime:

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation. “It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”… Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time. “They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

As if on cue, NBC 5 in Chicago reports that Smollett previously pleaded no contest to a charge of providing false information to police in a case that involved a DUI.

It was revealed Tuesday that in 2007 Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement, the L.A. City Attorney’s office confirmed to NBC News. Smollett, now 36, was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail in the 2007 case, an L.A. City Attorney’s spokesman told NBC News.

That’s certainly not going to help his credibility and may make it less likely prosecutors are willing to knock down a potential charge from a felony to a misdemeanor.

But Smollett’s life is obviously about more than staying out of jail. His scenes on Empire are already being cut as a result of the investigation. If he eventually confesses to setting this up, would Fox allow him to keep his job? On the plus side, there’s certainly a lot of free publicity to be had from this story. On the other hand, I’m not sure an attempt to smear 40+% of the country is the kind of thing that Fox wants to be associated with. Granted it’s entirely possible the fans of Empire wouldn’t care but the fans of other Fox shows might. Keeping Smollett around (if the worst turns out to be true) seems like a big risk for a big broadcasting company to take."

Smollett turned from a potential victim to a suspect in the January incident where he claimed a pair of men shouted racist and homophobic slurs while they beat him. The attack later came under scrutiny from Chicago police, who discovered that two men seen on surveillance video were friends of the actor. Smollett is now suspected of planning the attack and concocting a scheme to lie and blame it on masked Trump supporters.

As the New York Post reported, a new investigation is looking into whether a threatening letter Smollett received just days before the alleged attack could have also been a hoax. The investigation is being led by the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Services, which are looking into claims from Nigerian brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo that Smollett helped to put together the letter.

Unnamed federal officials told ABC News that the note has been sent to an FBI crime lab for analysis. The envelope that contained the letter reportedly had the word “MAGA” written in large red letters. Smollett claimed that the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country!” during the attack, a reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The latest allegations could be the most serious for Smollett, with mail fraud being a federal offense that could carry punishment of up to five years or more.

The allegations have led to a major backlash against Jussie Smollett, with many celebrities and politicians who initially stood behind him after the allegations first surfaced now demanding that Smollett address the allegations. The actor has maintained that he did not concoct a hoax and was indeed a victim of a hate attack, but he has also hired a criminal defense attorney.

A new report from TMZ claims that Smollett’s scenes from Empire have been almost entirely cut out, with the show’s writers rushing to erase his storylines and fill in the gaps with other characters. The report cited production sources who said that the series creators have completely changed nine scenes that featured Smollett, and have also cut his role out of an Empire musical that was in early stages of production. Though Empire producers had initially thrown cold water on a report that he was being written out of the show, Smollet’s role on the Fox drama going forward now appears to be up in the air."

He received two years probation for his actions. Smollett is being questioned regarding his claims that he was assaulted and called racial and homophobic slurs . Chicago Police claim they have reason to believe that the actor orchestrated the event, according to a New York Times report.The Empire star was reportedly attacked by two masked figures, later said to be brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. They, however, told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax.“After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, confirming that the brothers are no longer suspects.One of the brothers, both of whom were detained on Wednesday, was an extra on Smollett’s television show. By Friday evening, both brothers were released without charges.Smollett had previously claimed that he believed the attackers were supporters of US President Donald Trump.The actor’s attorneys released a statement on Saturday night, claiming “Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement continued. “Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”Smollett has already received backlash for the accusations. Donald Trump, Jr. said, “It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad, and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.”“The Smollett story isn’t about conservatives pouncing,” wrote political commentator Ben Shapiro. “It’s about an insane hoax propped up and promulgated as ‘Trump’s America’ for political purposes.”Ryan Fournier, a political commentator and the chairman of Students for Trump, said, “This is how mentally insane the Left has become. They will do anything to bring us down. Well it’s not happening, because Jussie is going to jail.”"

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night Empire actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

Smollett's family, who are also actors, have stood by him vocally since the incident on January 29.

They spoke out before he did to condemn the incident as it was described and call for an end to hate crimes.

In the last two weeks, Smollett has been forced to deny allegations that he orchestrated the attack and paid two Nigerian-descent brothers to carry it out.

The claims originated from unnamed police sources who continue to leak details of the investigation.

They said Smollett made it up either because he feared he was being written out of Empire, something Fox has ruled out, or because a threatening letter he received a week before the incident did not receive enough attention.

The letter is now being analyzed by the FBI and the United States Postal Service.

Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo have both been questioned over the alleged attack and say they were paid by Smollett to carry it out

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident. It is now being analyzed by the FBI and the US Postal Service. The brothers reportedly told investigators Smollett knew about it and was involved in sending it

Smollett and Empire producer Dennis Hammer both handled it with gloves before the police arrived to investigate it on January 22.

It contained a white powdery substance and had the words: 'Smollett Jussie you will die, black f*g' written out in cut and pasted magazine lettering.

Smollett, during an interview with Good Morning America last week, spoke of the letter as proof that he was under constant attack as a gay black man.

He described it on the show and said: 'Did I make that up too?'

His story is now being relentlessly undermined by the Chicago PD's investigation which, in its latest development, has reportedly found footage of the brothers taking a ride-share to where they allegedly attacked the star.

According to police sources cited by CBS and Page Six, Abel and Ola Osundairo were filmed in a car on their way to the downtown Chicago spot where they are said to have attacked Smollett.

They seemed 'nervous' in the car and also on the bench while they watched Smollett walk past them, according to the sources.

They are said to have claimed in police interviews last week that Smollett, who is openly gay, paid them $3,500 to jump him in what he later told police was a racist and homophobic attack where his assailants yelled: 'This MAGA country!'

Smollett did not return home to his apartment on January 29, the day of the attack, until after midnight. At around 2am, he went out to get a sandwich from a Subway near his building and claims he was jumped on his walk home. There is only a small window of time for him to have been seen in the building with the brothers before the alleged attack was reported at 2.42am

Authorities received a tip on Tuesday that the brothers were seen Smollett's apartment building in an elevator with him on the night of the attack but that was quickly ruled out after they reviewed surveillance footage from inside the building.

Smollett knew at least one of the brothers and even trained with them in the gym, paid them and promised them more money after they had returned from Nigeria.

They allegedly said he told them where to buy the rope that was tied around his neck in the neck.

The Empire star follows the brothers on Instagram and admitted using one as a personal trainer in the past.

He hired a team of lawyers this week and is expected to be questioned again by police soon.

According to production sources, he has had his scenes in the forthcoming episodes of Episode cut drastically in light of the scandal.

Fox would not comment on it on Tuesday when contacted repeatedly by DailyMail.com.

The timeline of the incident is as follows.

Smollett returned home from New York City on a delayed flight sometime around midnight or afterwards on January 29.

He broadcast details of the delay on Instagram in what police now say may have been a way for him to communicate with the two brothers.

At around 2am, he went out to get a sandwich from Subway and was walking home in freezing conditions when he claims he was attacked and had the noose put around his neck.

Surveillance cameras picked him up leaving the subway, they caught the two brothers sitting on a bench and they caught Smollett walking back into his apartment building with a rope around his neck but no footage of the attack has been found.

Once Smollett was back inside his building, his friend, 60-year-old Frank Gatson, called the police.

It was around 40 minutes after the attack had happened and Smollett was still wearing the rope around his neck to preserve it as evidence.

He took himself to the hospital afterwards and was given the all-clear and stayed relatively quiet as the word reacted in horror and disbelief to the details of the incident.

He then played a sold-out show in Los Angeles where he was triumphant and cheered on by fans.

In the days that followed, whispers of doubt began leaking from the Chicago police department and his cooperation with the probe came into question as detectives revealed that he had not handed over his phone.

Smollett, frustrated by the growing skepticism surrounding his story, appeared on Good Morning America to plead his case.

Within hours of his interview being aired, it emerged that the brothers had been taken into custody and were being questioned about the theory that it was a hoax."

The letter is currently being analyzed in an FBI crime lab, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service is also investigating the situation, according to federal officials.

Two Nigerian brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who were persons of interest in the attack, told authorities that Smollett paid them to stage the attack after getting mad that the threatening letter didn't get as much attention as he wanted. One of the brothers has appeared on ""Empire"" before, and the other was reportedly Smollett's personal trainer.

The brothers have since issued a public statement saying they are not racist, homophobic or anti-Trump, and saying they are American citizens born and raised in Chicago.

Smollett's attorneys have denied the brothers' claim that he orchestrated the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" attorneys Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh said in a Sunday statement. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

According to CNN, Chicago police said that a threatening letter addressed to Smollett was received on Jan. 22 at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where “Empire” is filmed. The envelope, which included “MAGA” in red letters, contained a white powder that authorities later determined to be aspirin.

According to a Monday report by ABC News, law enforcement was investigating the two brothers who were questioned last week by police — Ola and Abel Osundairo — who had said that Smollett was upset the letter didn’t get enough attention.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement after the incident, the actor said he was battered “about the face,” had bleach poured on him and had a rope wrapped around his neck.

A CNN report on Saturday, citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, said investigators believe Smollett may have paid the two men — Nigerian brothers with a professional connection to Smollett — to orchestrate the attack. According to the report, the men were released after agreeing to cooperate with investigators.

Smollett’s lawyers have denied that the reported attack was a hoax, saying “anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” On Monday, representatives for the “Empire” star said that he had “no plans” to meet with Chicago police for further questioning."

Smollett was sentenced to two years of probation, the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office confirmed with NBC News Tuesday. He also had to choose between jail time or paying a fine.

The case comes as Chicago Police Department (CPD) seek to meet with Smollett over an alleged attack.

Smollett claimed he was attacked, doused with an unknown chemical substance and had a rope tied around his neck by two men who yelled “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country” at him on Jan. 29.

There have been reports, however, that the attack was organized by Smollett and two brothers who were allegedly paid to help, according to CNN. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett On MAGA Hats: ‘I Never Said That’)

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement Sunday saying such allegations were “nothing further from the truth.”

Here is the latest statement from the attorneys that Jussie Smollett has retained: pic.twitter.com/E6L8KytPgy — ???????????????????????????????????? ???????????????? (@WashNews) February 17, 2019

Sources have said a potential motive for staging the attack was over a threat letter that did not receive enough attention, CBS 2 Chicago reported.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source said to CBS 2 Chicago.

The alleged attack initially caused outrage among several celebrities and Democratic politicians, with some blaming President Donald Trump. Democrats like California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker kept their original statements on the issue while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted her original tweet.

Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants said to The Daily Caller News Foundation that Smollett’s career and reputation could end if the alleged attack turned out to be fake.

“Many people on the left will be privately devastated but most won’t apologize for false accusations and instead they will just move on to another controversy,” Schiffer said. “Politically those on the right may call for Smollett to be prosecuted as a hate crime for spewing an incitement of hatred against millions of MAGA members and white people.”

Smollett will need to “come clean” and “lay out the facts” in order to fix a damaged reputation, Schiffer added. But “his reputation for trust is going to take years to revitalize.”

It’s claimed that Jussie Smollett will be getting less screen time in the final episodes of Empire’s latest season. The TV star’s family reportedly pushed for the cut-back as they are concerned after he reported being attacked by two men last month. But what does this mean for his career?

On 29 January in Chicago, Jussie was reportedly approached by two men who are said to have beaten the actor and hurled racial and homophobic slurs.

Since then, the 36-year-old has been forced to deny claims he ‘orchestrated’ the attack and hasn’t been truthful about the incident.

Jussie addressed the attack on-stage in Chicago a few days later and sat down for a TV interview last week. However, he’s maintained a social media silence.

With his remaining scenes on Empire reportedly scaled back, speculation is rife over what this could mean for Jussie’s career going forward.

Jussie was reportedly attacked by two men late at night in Chicago

PR expert and CEO at 5WPR, Ronn Torossian, told Metro.co.uk: ‘Right now, Smollett’s biggest problem is all of the speculation surrounding the investigation.

‘One of the cardinal rules in crisis communications is not waiting – and Smollett is waiting too long to clear the air and control the narrative.’

Torossian added: ‘While he has publicly expressed outrage at the theory that he may have set up the attack, he hasn’t taken the necessary steps to salvage his career and reputation (and the reputation of the show).’

Torossian also noted a comment from Jussie’s reps stating that he would not be meeting with Chicago Police Department this week but will still cooperate with the investigation.

According to the PR guru, this could ‘risk more speculation and damage to his career.

‘When a crisis strikes, as it almost inevitably does for public figures, transparency and disclosure is key. PR is what can make a drastic difference between a minor mishap and a career-halting nightmare.’

In Torossian’s opinion, the controversy will be detrimental for Jussie’s career with even celebrities questioning the authenticity of the attack.

The PR expert said: ‘It will get worse only if he waits to make a statement and clear the air.

‘Generally in the world of crisis, there’s two courts to worry about, the court of law and the court of public opinion.’
