If you think the manure-spreaders of sensationalism who masquerade as ethical practitioners of journalism learned anything from last week’s MAGA-bashing Covington Catholic High School hoax, I have three words for you: Ha, ha, ha.

On Tuesday morning, uncorroborated claims by actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a “brutal” hate crime by Trump supporters in Chicago went viral across social media. Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed “exclusive” headlines that the “Empire” cast member was “beaten by MAGA backers” in a “homophobic attack” at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what “Empire” is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked “45 and all his white hooded cohorts” on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site’s squib on the TV star’s alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who “wrapped rope around his neck,” which multiple outlets characterized as a “noose.” A police statement providing incident background stated that “the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But colour me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on “Empire.” Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word “MAGA” on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound: TMZ quoted one of the “MAGA country” attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: “Aren’t you that f—-t ‘Empire’ n—–?” Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighbourhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country”? Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of “Empire,” could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ’s claim that Smollett had the “hell beat outta him” and attackers “broke his ribs” plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead “self-transported” to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett’s friend “Frank” refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; “no or minor injury” was observed; and “officers never sent a ‘flash’ message with offender descriptions to field units.” Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD’s initial press release on the incident: Any mention of “MAGA supporters” or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere’s claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that “thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.”

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take “weeks” to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate.

CPD’s public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white “MAGA attackers” were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied: “We have no idea where that came from.”

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the “MAGA” angle in a “follow-up, supplemental interview.” Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for “MAGA” and “Smollett” on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to “denounce Jussie Smollett’s MAGA attackers” who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured “news:” Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?"

In terrible news, “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was attacked early in the morning of January 29 in what Chicago police are calling a possible hate crime, authorities confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. The actor, who portrays Jamal Lyon, on the hit Fox show, was exiting a restaurant in the 300 block of East Lower Water Street when two suspects allegedly began yelling racial and homophobic slurs towards him. From there, Jussie was punched before an unknown chemical substance was poured over him, police said. One of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck. He was hospitalized for his injuries. Smollett’s character Jamal is gay and in real life, he self-identifies as gay. This is so horrific and tragic. This element of hate that we are now living in is beyond reprehensible. Our prayers go out to the wonderful Jussie Smollett!

In other “Empire” news, Mary J. Blige praised her dear friend Taraji P. Henson as the actress received her very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on January 28. Both Blige and John Singleton gave speeches in honor of Henson. Said Blige: “You have been a total inspiration to me….I never had a friend that I could call while I’m on set and say, ‘How do I do this as an actress?’ and you helped me where I needed help. In my mind, that’s rare because people don’t share and you’re a sharer.”

The Jackson family issued a statement regarding the controversial HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland,” in which former friends of the late Michael Jackson, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, claim the King of Pop molested them for many years. Both Robson and Safechuck testified under oath that Jackson never touched them. The following is an excerpt from the Jacksons’ statement: “Michael Jackson is our brother and son. We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity. We are proud of what Michael stands for. Michael is not here to defend himself, otherwise these allegations would not have been made.” The Jackson Family.

CHICAGO — Chicago police have opened a hate crime investigation after a man the department identified as a 36-year-old cast member of the television show “Empire” alleged he was physically attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

Police wouldn’t release the actor’s name, but a statement from the Fox studio and network on which “Empire” airs identified him Tuesday as Jussie Smollett.

A statement from Chicago police says the man said he was walking downtown about 2 a.m.

Tuesday when two men approached him shouting, then struck him in the face and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him before one wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say he was hospitalized in good condition."

“It’s absolutely horrific,” the “Flack” leading lady told Fox News on Thursday during a network party at the Television Critics Association winter press tour in Los Angeles. “I have no more information than anyone else does, but I think as anyone with a conscience and a pulse – I’m just f—king horrified.”

The “True Blood” alum's comments came after Smollett was hospitalized, claiming he'd been attacked by two assailants in Chicago who yelled out “racial and homophobic slurs” and poured an unknown chemical substance on him before wrapping a rope around his neck.

Paquin, 36, is a longtime and very vocal supporter of the LGBTQIA community and identifies as bisexual.

Smollett also alleges the perpetrators shouted, “this is MAGA country” during the attack -- a pointed reference to the slogan popularized by President Trump and his supporters: Make America Great Again.

The 36-year-old Smollett broke his silence Friday in a statement to Essence, thanking his fans for the support he has received.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett began in the statement. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The “Sum of My Music” singer concluded: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me. “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

“For security reasons we cannot accommodate any meet & greets,” the email that was sent to fans said according to TMZ. The email was sent to all the fans who purchased meet and greet tickets letting them know that their money will be refunded.

The Empire star was assaulted by Trump supporters early Tuesday (Jan. 29) morning while on his way home after a flight from New York to Chicago. Two white men in ski masks reportedly brutally beat Smollett, leaving him with fractured ribs. They also poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck and screamed “This is MAGA Country.”

Almost two weeks before the attack, a note with cut out letters was reportedly sent to FOX Studios addressed to Smollett that read “You will die black f—-t.” In the top corner of the envelope, the senders wrote MAGA.

The incident is being investigated by Chicago Police.

Smollett released a statement after the attack thanking fans for their support.

File photo by Kevin Dietsch/UPI | License Photo

Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam apologized Saturday for a racist photo appearing on his page of a medical school yearbook, but said after further contemplation that he was not in the photograph.

His revised comments came as politicians and black activists nationwide called on him to resign.

Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would replace Northam as governor if he leaves office, said in a statement the image had ""shocked and saddened"" him did not explicitly call for him to resign. ""They are an example of a painful scourge that continues to haunt us today and holds us back from the progress we need to take,"" said Fairfax, who is African American.

The 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook shows one person in blackface and one person in a Ku Klux Klan outfit together in a photograph next to the governor's name. Northam, a pediatrician who graduated from the school that year, apologized Friday for appearing in the photo, but backtracked that statement in a news conference a day later, saying he was not in the photograph.

Northam also said he has no intention of resigning from office, despite a groundswell of calls to do otherwise from prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.

Northam said Saturday he once used shoe polish to darken his face to look like pop star Michael Jackson in a San Antonio dance contest in the mid-1980s, but after thinking about the yearbook photo and discussing it with other people, Northam said he wasn't the individual in the KKK robe or the individual in blackface. He suggested photos also mistakenly appeared on other peoples' pages of the yearbook.

""That is not my picture,"" he told reporters Saturday. ""That is not my person on the pictures.""

Northam acknowledged the controversy swirling around the photo, which first surfaced Friday on the conservative news website Big League Politics, as well as the calls for his resignation.

""Yesterday, I took responsibility for content that appeared on my page in the medical school yearbook that was clearly racist and offensive,"" Northam said. ""I cannot and will not excuse the content of the photos. It was racist and despicable.""

Northam added that when his staff showed him the yearbook, he was ""seeing it for the first time.""

When pressed about the pressure for him to resign, he said that would be the easy way out and a way for him to dodge responsibility.

""Today, I am not ready to ask Virginians forgiveness for my past actions,"" Northam said. ""I'm simply asking for an opportunity to demonstrate that the person I was is not the person I am today. I'm asking on the opportunity to earn your forgiveness.""

Both of Virginia's U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, said they have called Northam to tell him he must resign because he no longer can effectively serve as governor, The Washington Post reported.

Numerous other politicians from both parties have said he must go, including Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez and several Democratic Party presidential candidates.

President Donald Trump weighed in from Mar-a-Lago in Florida, on Twitter: ""Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, 'I believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.' This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on 'super' late term abortion. Unforgivable!""

And then he tweeted: ""Ed Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points!"""

The event’s Facebook post characterized its mission:

JOIN us for a Solidarity Rally for #JussieSmollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence. Black LGBTQ communities, particularly black trans women, have been assaulted, murdered, and face violence every day. With the normalization of violence against queer people, fueled by a toxic racist and anti-LGBTQ political agenda, we must address the ongoing violence against our communities.

“We’re going to continue to resist. And we’re going to continue to love,” said Jason Walker, the rally’s lead organizer, at the event.

Walker added, “I want this rally today to be a message that people of color, if you’re gay, trans, gender non-conforming, bisexual, lesbians — we’re going to live our lives and that we’re going to be proud,” Walker told the crowd. “We’re going to continue to resist. And we’re going to continue to love.”

Walker also led a chant, “When queer communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back. When people of color are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.”

Some of the rally’s featured speakers linked President Donald Trump to the aforementioned alleged assault on Smollett.

The Hollywood Reporter wrote:

Beyond speaking out for Smollett and LGBTQ people of color, speakers primarily used their time to address what they described as a growing movement of violence against LGBTQ, black, and other marginalized communities under the current presidential administration. Several speakers directly pointed to President Donald Trump and both the language and policies as the fuel for the attack on Smollett.

Via statement to BET, Smollett’s family assessed the claimed attack on their relative as a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

MSBNC’s Sharpton echoed Smollett’s family’s statement in describing the alleged violence as “racist” and “homophobic.”

Smollett claims to have been assaulted in Chicago on Tuesday morning around 2 a.m. His manager told authorities he heard the attackers say, “This is MAGA country.”

Via statement to Essence, Smollett linked his claims — which he described as “100% factual” — to what he framed as a broader American pathology: “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

The performance was initially supposed to include a meet-and-greet for fans who had upgraded their tickets; however, those people will be refunded due to security concerns, according to an email from the vendor, TicketWeb.

“Jussie is so honored to perform for his fans, friends and family on Saturday night. However, please forgive us. For security reasons, we cannot accommodate any meet & greets. Your meet & greet upgrade can either be refunded or donated to the Black AIDS Institute in your name,” said the email provided to ABC News.

The LAPD declined to comment on whether there will be additional police presence around the venue, and it’s unclear if the venue itself beefed up security for the “Empire” star.

Smollett, 36, was expected to perform tracks from his album “Sum of My Music,” which was released last year.

Dozens of detectives have been pursuing new leads and tracking the actor’s movements that morning through video and photos, Chicago Police previously told ABC News.

Police are also hoping to track down and speak to two potential persons of interest who can be seen in surveillance video near the area where the alleged assault took place.

“While the video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for the Chicago Police Department, wrote on Twitter.

Smollett told police that the men also poured “an unknown chemical substance” on him — possibly bleach — and wrapped a rope around his neck, police said. The rope was still around Smollett’s neck when police spoke to him afterward, officials said.

Brandon Z. Moore, Smollett’s music manager, previously told ABC News that he was on the phone with the actor when the alleged attack happened and that he had heard a scuffle, a racial slur and the words “MAGA country,” presumably coming from the attackers.

Police confirmed that they had spoken to Moore and that his account was noted in the police report. Both Moore and Smollett told police they were on the phone with each other at the time of the attack, police added.

However, as of Thursday, police had not yet seen phone records to confirm their accounts and Smollett had declined to hand over his cell phone to detectives. Police say Smollet is being treated as a victim and they have no interest or probable cause to obtain his call records through a search warrant.

As of Saturday morning, there were no further updates on the investigation, Chicago Police told ABC News.

Smollett thanked his fans in a statement on Friday for their support, and said he was recovering both mentally and physically.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” he said in a statement. “My body is strong and my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

He also made an effort to refute any claims made online that his story might have changed.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in the statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

As temperatures dipped to 17 degrees on Friday (Feb. 1) night in New York City, dozens of demonstrators stood in the cold at Manhattan’s Grand Army Plaza to denounce hate crimes and hateful rhetoric, and to stand in support with Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

Organizers from the New York City Anti-Violence League, Voices Of Community Activists & Leaders (VOCAL) and Queerocracy, among many other supporting organizations, urged the crowd to let their voices be heard on Friday night. “When queer people are under attack, what do we do?” demonstrators chanted, with the crowd responding “stand up, fight back.”

“I want people to challenge their preconceived notions about these communities,” Queerocracy member Jake Nill told Billboard. “I want them to challenge their perception … We want our people to have their own political agency, to be able to change narratives and norms, and to challenge what the state throws at them.”

The protest comes just days after Smollett was attacked in Chicago, where he says two individuals hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a noose around his neck, poured a liquid on him and beat him. Since the attack, Smollett has released a statement saying he is in good health. “My body is strong, but my soul is stronger,” he wrote.

While many of the speakers spoke out for Smollett and called the attack on him “domestic terrorism,” much of the focus at the rally was also on the numerous cases of transgender violence that have already occurred. The speakers especially highlighted the death of Dana Martin, a 31-year old black transgender woman who was shot and killed in Montgomery, Ala. in January, and Candice Elease Pinky, a black trans woman who was chased and shot in Houston and is now recovering from her injuries.

Tanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker, an activist and co-founder of the New York Transgender Advocacy Group (NYTAG), condemned the actions of President Trump and his administration, saying that their rhetoric is what led to these attacks.

“They wanna take all of our rights away, and we cannot live our lives,” Walker yelled into the crowd. “His policies are genocidal. If you can't get a job, you can't go to the store and eat, you can't fight for your rights, it is genocidal.”

The crowd at the rally was emotionally-fueled, with many carrying different protest signs speaking out for their communities. “Build hate crime prevention centers, not walls,” one read. “Black queer lives matter,” read another.

Tabytha Gonzalez, an activist and office manager for the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, shared statistics with the crowd showing that transgender women of color are still the most affected by incidents of hate-related violence. Gonzalez told the crowd that while this demonstration was necessary, resistance should not only come when a celebrity is involved.

“I need to see your righteous indignation when a transgender woman's blood dries up on this concrete! You do your tweets and you think that is enough, but that is not enough,” Gonzalez yelled into the crowd. “If they come for me at night, they're gonna come for your ass in the morning.”"

Jussie Smollett has had to cancel his meet-and-greet with fans in L.A. this weekend due to security concerns.

According to TMZ, an email was sent out to ticketholders of Smollett’s sold-out show at the Troubador Saturday night saying that the meet-and-greet session has been canceled.

“For security reasons we cannot accommodate any meet & greets.”

TMZ adds that the email doesn’t refer to any specific threat.

The Empire star’s show comes days after the brutally homophobic and racist attack he endured in Chicago on Tuesday morning.

Smollett was grabbing a quick bite from a local Subway when he was attacked by two men wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. The thugs beat him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and tied a noose around his neck while calling him racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett is now set to have 24/7 armed security at least until the two men who attacked him Tuesday morning are apprehended.

The FBI and Chicago Police Department are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime. Investigators have located a surveillance camera that shows people who are now wanted for questioning, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Twitter.

Smollett exclusively told ESSENCE that he’s recovering, but that he’s thankful for the mass outpouring of support he’s received over the last few days.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett began in his statement to ESSENCE. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. “"

Smollett told police that two masked men jumped him on his walk home at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. He said they punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing. Smollett’s manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven’t seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett’s description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett’s walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the time stamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett’s account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to the Trump campaign’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

President Donald Trump, expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

“That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse,” the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn’t far from the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett’s representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hourlong drama “Empire” follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett’s character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation’s most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels.

Shortly after learning that Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, had pleaded guilty last Saturday to racketeering, conspiracy, firearms offenses, narcotics trafficking and more, Sara Molina told TMZ that he’s left her and their daughter to deal with the aftermath.

“He did what he did – he made his bed and now he has to lie in it,” Molina told TMZ. “But he didn’t think of how it’s going to affect others. I’m left to pick up the pieces of whatever mess he’s made, which is and has always been a thing.”

Tekashi 6ix9ine, who remained behind bars on Saturday, is expected to receive leniency at his sentencing in January 2020. His crimes typically draw a mandatory minimum of 27 years in prison. The rapper admitted to selling a kilo of heroin and offering payment to shoot a rival gang member.

Molina told TMZ that after everything that happens, she does not foresee Tekashi69x9ine having any sort of relationship with their daughter, Saraiyah, at least in the immediate future.

“Until I feel like he’s in a space in life and in a solid situation, I can’t feel comfortable allowing him to bring whatever he has with him into my daughter’s life,” Molina said. “My job is to protect my daughter at all costs, even if that means him.”

Tekashi 6ix9ine asked to be moved away from Crips and Bloods and is in a facility known for housing cooperating witnesses, TMZ has reported.

Molina told TMZ that the events in her ex-boyfriend’s life are unfortunate.

Actor Jussie Smollett has thanked fans for their support in his first statement following an alleged attack he suffered earlier this week.

The Empire star was beaten and reportedly had a noose tied around his neck by masked men in a racist and homophobic hate crime assault that took place on Tuesday in Chicago.

On Thursday, Smollett's family members spoke out about the alleged incident, insisting they are confident justice will be served, and now the 35 year old is echoing their statement, insisting his story and statements to police investigators have stayed consistent, despite differing accounts in the media.

""Let me start by saying that I'm OK,"" a statement to Essence magazine reads. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" the statement continues. ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process.""

Smollett is also vowing to stay positive while he deals with his ordeal.

""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,"" the star adds. ""It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me. With Love, respect & honor...Jussie.""

Police officers are investigating the brutal incident and have released images of two people they want to question. However, the suspects have not been publicly identified and no arrests have been made yet."

We're not sure what Stephen Colbert was expecting from The Umbrella Academy's Ellen Page when she visited Thursday night's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Page has never been one to shy away from expressing her views on politics and social issues, using the platforms afforded her through her acting to campaign for a wide variety of causes important to her – from LGBTQ rights and climate change to female representation in Hollywood and the important of free speech/free press.

Still, the ""standard late-night playbook"" usually means a guest comes on and spends 15% of their time talking ""serious,"" 35% of their time on a ""pleasant personal or on-set anecdote,"" and 50% of their time plugging their project like there's no tomorrow. That last figure shifts to 45% if they're on The Tonight Show, with 5% going to some ""wacky, goofy stunt"" Jimmy Fallon has them go through in place of a deep, thought-provoking interview.

Yeah… Page wasn't having any of that, unleashing a series of powerful, intense, and heartfelt remarks aimed at President Donald Trump's White House – particularly Vice President Mike Pence – and the wave of hateful leadership seeping into the fabric of the nation.

While Colbert is no stranger to supporting a number of the points Page raised during her interview, make note of his facial expressions and body language after he has to follow Page's words with a plug for The Umbrella Academy – we're pretty sure even Netflix would've cringed a little at that segue:

● On LGBTQ rights: ""Sorry, I'm like really fired up tonight, but it feels impossible not to feel this way right now, with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who, like, wishes I couldn't be married.""

After a photo of Page and her wife was shown, the actress/activist continued:

""Let's just be clear: The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in 'conversion therapy,' he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the [governor] of Indiana.""

● On the impact hateful rhetoric and the ""politics of division"" are having on our nation – in particular, younger generations:

""If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're gonna kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street. … This needs to f***ing stop.""

● Believing climate change to be no more debatable an issue than the recent attack (an alleged hate crime) on Empire star Jussie Smollett, Page wants to know where the big screen urgency is on the issue:

""We've been told, as we know it, that by 2030, the world as we know it, that's it. That's it. If it was a movie, we'd have Bruce Willis in a suit, like talking about something — please cast me. Please, Amy Adams, save us.""

On the same day in 1989, forty-three infants are inexplicably born to random, unconnected women who showed no signs of pregnancy the day before. Seven are adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves, a billionaire industrialist, who creates The Umbrella Academy and prepares his ""children"" to save the world. But not everything went according to plan. In their teenage years, the family fractured and the team disbanded. Now, the six surviving thirty-something members reunite upon the news of Hargreeves' passing. Luther, Diego, Allison, Klaus, Vanya and Number Five work together to solve a mystery surrounding their father's death. But the estranged family once again begins to come apart due to their divergent personalities and abilities, not to mention the imminent threat of a global apocalypse.

Netflix's version of the Hargreeves family includes: Ellen Page (X-Men: Days of Future Past) as sister Vanya, who appears to manifest no super powers but has an amazingly strong interest in music; Tom Hopper (Game of Thrones) as Luther/Spaceboy, leader of The Umbrella Academy; Robert Sheehan (Bad Reputation) as shoeless speaker-with-the-dead Klaus Hargreeves/The Séance; Emmy Raver-Lampman (Wicked) as Allison/The Rumor, who can alter reality with her lies; David Castaneda (Blindspot) as Diego/The Kraken, the reckless and rebellious member of the family; Aidan Gallagher (Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn) as Number Five/The Boy, the family's time-travelling, perpetually young brain; Colm Feore (House of Cards) as world-renowned billionaire industrialist and eccentric inventor Sir Reginald Hargreeves; and Adam Godley (Breaking Bad) as Pogo, a genetically engineered, tweed jacket-wearing, talking chimpanzee and family advisor/mentor.

The Umbrella Academy also stars award-winning singer/actress Mary J. Blige (Mudbound) as ruthless, time traveling hitwoman Cha-Cha; Cameron Britton (Mindhunter) as her deadly efficient partner Hazel; Ashley Madekwe (Revenge) as Detective Patch, a driven, fast riser within the police department investigating a series of murders – and The Academy; John Magaro (The Big Short) as Leonard Peabody, who begins to take music lessons from Vanya and sees something special in this constantly dismissed wallflower and Kate Walsh (Grey's Anatomy) as The Handler, a composed and confident leader of a mysterious, bureaucratic company.

Netflix's The Umbrella Academy leaps the streaming service in a single bound come February 15th."

According to The Chicago Tribune, Smollett was approached 2 a.m. on Tuesday, January 29, by two people around who yelled racial and homophobic slurs. He was hit and doused in an unknown chemical substance, reportedly bleach, and a rope was wrapped around his neck. The actor later told police his assailants said, “This is MAGA country.”

In the wake of the attack, friends and supporters of Smollett have joined activists and allies in condemning the racial and homophobic violence and pleading for the safety for queer people of color. Here are some of their words, starting with those of Empire co-creator Lee Daniels.

Lee Daniels

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f—t n—r’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front and no racist f—k can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another f—king day in America.”

“To have the audacity to be young, black, and gay is a beautiful way of living and is a loving that bigots and racists and homophobes want to snuff out. I don’t know @jussiesmollett personally. I’ve never met him, but my heart breaks for him and his family. For it to be 2019 and still have to fear that one day a noose might be tied around your neck is horrifying. For it to be 2019 and you cannot be gay without wondering, ‘Will this be the day that I’m attacked’ is unacceptable and deplorable. For it to be 2019 and the hideous poison that is MAGA and all it represents to be wildly unchecked from the top of the government all the way down to your average everyday street should makes us all have the biggest pits in our stomachs. Black and queer people just went to live. They just want to occupy the space on the planet that was made for them. They want to flourish and be happy and not worry and laugh about dumb s—t. And until they can do that, we have failed as a country. I don’t know that we’re better than this, but gahtdamn it, we ought to be.”

“What happened to him shouldn’t happen to anyone; that it happened to him, a famous person with means and a platform, is important to continue this discussion on a national level, but what of the black men whose lives become a footnote in the seemingly endless collection of police shootings, or the black trans women forced into victimhood by the sole merit of their existence?

“It’s 2019 and we deserve better. We all need to do better and be better or what’s left of this country’s soul will shrivel up and die like the promise of 40 acres and a mule made to freed slaves by their once and future oppressors.”

“It’s easy to take courage for granted when the person who demonstrates it is the star of a hit show, or has sold any number of records. It takes great risk for many queer people and POC to simply live as they are. Smollett took on more risk than many may have imagined, a recognition that deserves to be held.”

“The Chicago Police Department and FBI are now conducting an investigation into whether this incident was a hate crime, however we as Black queer people know the truth: It was.

“We know this because everyday our multiple marginalized identities increase our chances of facing racist, homophobic vitriol — and this fact has only intensified under the Trump administration with their dog whistle politics. So as we wait to see if justice is served for Smollett, we as Black queer people wait to see if America will finally see our lives as worth protecting.

“Because history has rarely been on the side of Black queer folk.”

“It’s important to acknowledge that the hate Smollett faced as a black gay man was a bi-product of society’s tolerance of racism and homophobia. There is racial bias in how LGBTQ people are protected in mainstream society, as there is homophobia in how black people are protected within their own community.

“Why isn’t there more support for murdered black trans women within the Black community as for slain cisgender black men? Why aren’t there more efforts to eradicate the HIV/AIDS crisis still impacting black gay men as there were for white gay men decades ago? These are the questions I ask myself daily when people try to suggest that I choose between an LGBTQ community or a black one.

“If we are to truly be a society that is serious about combating white supremacy, we have to recognize that racism and homophobia are byproducts that prolong such hate.”"

“This horrible attack was on one of our own, in our town,” an unidentified source told Deadline Hollywood. “Everybody’s behind Jussie 100% and he’s the first priority, but people need to process what happened to him too,” the source told the website.

Trauma counselors from the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAF-AFTRA) have been available on the set for cast and crew members who might need support and they’ll be there for a few weeks as Smollett, 35, heals and returns to the show that stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard.

The attack took place in the wee hours of Tuesday morning as Smollett walked home. The actor told police that two men poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck as they shouted racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago police have said that they have video of Smollett walking away from the two alleged assailants and also video of him with a rope around his neck. The police department has placed at least 12 detectives on the case and released images of two shadowy figures. The violent assault cost Smollett a short stay at Northwestern Hospital.

The case has grabbed the attention and sympathy of people across the country, who regularly praise Smollett for his work on and off screen. Most recently, the actor earned high marks for taking to social media with brother, Jake Smollett, and sister, Jazz Smollett, to join the campaign to save Bennett College, an HBCU in North Carolina that launched an aggressive fundraising campaign to prevent itself from losing accreditation. Smollett and his siblings wore “Stand with Bennett” T-shirts in photos they posted to Twitter and the actor told Al Sharpton on his MSNBC show that saving the school is crucial. In fact, fans of Smollett have been moved since the attack to donate to the Bennett campaign in his honor.

The incident has unleashed a gamut of emotions from those who admire Smollett, Empire co-creator Lee Daniels unleashed his frustration via Instagram this week, calling the attack, “Just another —-ing day in America.”

Now he adds victim of an insidious hate crime to his curriculum vitae – an offense so egregious, President Donald Trump told reporters “It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

According to the incident report from Chicago Police Department, Smollett claims he was advanced upon by two masked men, who taunted him with racial and homophobic slurs: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

If this claim is proven true, Trump is indeed correct, and swift and equal justice must be applied. Yet five days later, amidst accusations and allegations, the pieces of the puzzle aren’t quite fitting snugly together.

Puzzle Pieces

In the bitterly cold, early morning hours on a windy Chicago street, Smollett, having just flown into town, was headed home after catching a bite at a local sub shop. Here, he claims he was set upon by MAGA thugs.

But Smollett did not call 9-1-1 after the alleged incident – instead, he continued to walk to his apartment in the 300 block of East North Water Street, proceeded past security guards without stopping to ask for help or to explain what he had just survived, and ended up in a friend’s apartment. All of this is on security video from the building’s lobby.

Some 40 minutes later, police were summoned to find Smollett wearing a rope “loosely” around his neck like a tie, a scratch on his face, and refusing to allow body cams to record the interview. He then went on his own to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. His injuries, bruises and a visible scratch, were not life threatening, and the actor clearly heardwas released in “good” condition.

In a follow up interview with local police, Smollett elaborated on his account, claiming the attackers were wearing ski masks and that they yelled, “This is MAGA country.” Many local Chicagoans familiar with the swanky Streeterville neighborhood began wondering aloud if the attack actually took place – a location where redneck, white supremacists in the wee hours of the morning were not likely to be seen, let alone lying in wait for Smollett in -23 degree temperatures.

But Smollett and his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, claim they were on the phone together at the time of the attack, and that Moore clearly heard racial slurs. Neither Smollett nor Moore have turned their phones over to Chicago PD for verification.

Chicago Police have scoured every available security camera – public and private – hoping to find the attack and work backward to identify the unknown subjects. So far, they have video of Smollett alone at the sub shop and two figures braving the bitter temperatures on the other side of the street, yet no footage of the Empire actor and the two unknown “persons of interest” near each other. They have released vague descriptions at best – attackers were male and dressed in black – but they cannot identify the race of the suspects.

No smoking gun. What sent red flags for those following the story was Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s tweet: “Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there’s no place for it here in the city of Chicago.” Alleged statement?

Local ABC news affiliate reporter, Rafer Weigel, a local born and raised, is keeping real time of events surrounding the story, reporting that a dozen detectives have found nothing to corroborate Smollett’s claims.

To be clear. I am not accusing #JessieSmollett of lying. I’m saying #ChicagoPD and Chicago FBI have been working round the clock & have found nothing to support it. And given the extremity of his claims and where they allegedly took place it has them skeptical. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) January 30, 2019

Proof or Another #MeToo Moment?

Smollett finally released his statement to the public to thank his well-wishers and assure them that he is doing well in light of the trauma he supposedly suffered and that he is righteous in the telling of his story:

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

If Smollett was the victim of a heinous hate crime, the perpetrators must be hunted down as criminals and brought to a swift and righteous end with jail time to the fullest extent of the law. But if this is just an elaborate hoax or cover-up of a personal or publicity nature, justice will be served in more public and retaliatory fashion. Okay Chicago PD, the ball is in your court – don’t miss the shot."

Smollett, who was hospitalised for his injuries, told the police that the attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments during the attack.

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBT issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBT survivors of violence."

The actor/singer is scheduled to play at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on Saturday (02Feb18), but has now decided to pull the plug on an up close and personal event with fans which was planned to take place prior to the show.

According to editors at TMZ.com, an email was sent to ticketholders informing them of the decision.

""For security reasons, we cannot accommodate any meet and greets,"" the email reads, though does not refer to any specific threat.

Meet and greet ticketholders can get a refund or donate the cost of the ticket to the Black AIDS Institute, a non-profit organisation which promotes awareness of HIV and AIDS in African-American communities.

The news comes just days after Jussie was attacked in an alleged racist and homophobic assault in Chicago, Illinois. The Empire star was reportedly beaten and had a noose tied around his neck by masked men on Tuesday (29Jan19). Police officers are investigating the incident and have released images of two people they want to question.

However, the suspects have not been publicly identified and arrests have yet to be made.

On Thursday, Jussie issued a statement to Essence magazine, insisting his account given to police investigators has remained consistent, despite differing accounts in the media.

""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you.

Smollett, who is black, said that one of the attackers put a noose around his neck and poured an unidentified substance on him. According to the police, the two attackers were also “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” at Smollett, who is gay. Smollett also told the police that the attackers yelled, “MAGA country.”

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in a statement released by his publicist on Friday. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

It’s hardly surprising that the homophobic attack appears to have been perpetrated by supporters of the Trump administration. Vice President Mike Pence is explicitly anti-LGBTQ, and has been for a long time. Last month, it was revealed that his wife Karen had taken a teaching job at a school that prohibits LGBTQ students and faculty. Pence used his Christianity to justify his right to discriminate. “The criticism of Christian education in America should stop,” he said, adding that “major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.”

The attack on Smollett is one of countless reminders that Pence is not just some bigoted old white guy leafing through the Bible for passages that will rationalize his hatred; he’s the vice president of the United States, and the Trump administration’s tacit endorsement of discrimination against the LGBTQ community only emboldens people to express their hate in public, including with violence. On Thursday night, the actress Ellen Page, who is gay, appeared on the Late Show With Stephen Colbert to tee off on Trump and Pence, essentially blaming the latter for the attack on Smollett:

“It feels impossible not to feel this way now with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. Let’s just be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love I have with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think what we need to know and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots to Jussie Smollett, I don’t know him personally, I send all my love. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Leaders should speak with integrity and compassion not hate and fear. Thank you, @EllenPage, for speaking out and being a powerful voice. pic.twitter.com/jhkXfKRqrJ — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 1, 2019

Rolling Stone reached out to Pence’s office for comment regarding Page’s remarks, or the alleged homophobic attack on Smollett, but did not receive an immediate response.

Page wasn’t the only one to publicly call out Pence this week. On Tuesday, Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves told the Daily Beast that Pence is more of a threat to America than President Trump. “Bush was a true believer; Trump doesn’t really try,” he said. “But I think the evangelicals are happy with Pence, and happy that he’s assigning the [federal judge] appointees,” said Greaves. “Trump is too stupid to predict; the guy has no concept of his own limitations. The thing that makes me most comfortable with Trump is the fact that he has no vision. Mike Pence really scares me: Pence has a clear, theocratic vision for the United States.”

Religious dogma is just about the only thing Pence has left to cling to. His dignity, his integrity and any other -ity connoting principle have been sacrificed in the name of the president. Since government began operating under a partial shutdown on December 21st, Pence has been lamely regurgitating Trump’s deranged rhetoric on border security. This week, he even came up with his own Trump-ian catch phrase in an attempt to drive home the need for a border wall.

I've listened to Mike Pence say ""good walls make good neighbors"" three separate times in three radio interviews he's over the past day. — andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) January 31, 2019

note: Pence actually said ""good fences make good neighbors"". He's quoting Robert Frost's poem, Mending Wall, which is not actually very pro-wall.https://t.co/7nJzx5Pmzyhttps://t.co/mwtrQ9f3j0 — andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) January 31, 2019

As Kaczynski points out, “Mending Wall,” the Robert Frost poem Pence is most definitely anti-wall:

Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it

And spills the upper boulders in the sun,

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

The work of hunters is another thing:

I have come after them and made repair

Where they have left not one stone on a stone,

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,

No one has seen them made or heard them made,

But at spring mending-time we find them there.

I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;

And on a day we meet to walk the line

And set the wall between us once again.

We keep the wall between us as we go.

To each the boulders that have fallen to each.

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls

We have to use a spell to make them balance:

“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”

We wear our fingers rough with handling them.

Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,

One on a side. It comes to little more:

There where it is we do not need the wall:

He is all pine and I am apple orchard.

My apple trees will never get across

And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.

He only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”

Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder

If I could put a notion in his head:

“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it

Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.

Before I built a wall I’d ask to know

What I was walling in or walling out,

And to whom I was like to give offense.

Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,

That wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,

But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather

He said it for himself. I see him there,

Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top

In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.

He moves in darkness as it seems to me,

Not of woods only and the shade of trees.

He will not go behind his father’s saying,

And he likes having thought of it so well

He says again, “Good fences make good neighbors.”

It’s probably a safe bet that Robert Frost would not have gotten along with Vice President Pence very well, either."

Entertainment rag TMZ.com first splashed “exclusive” headlines that the “Empire” cast member was “beaten by MAGA backers” in a “homophobic attack” at around 2 a.m. in Chicago. If you have no idea what “Empire” is or who Smollett is, join the club. The TV star is apparently a vocal critic of Trump and attacked “45 and all his white hooded cohorts” on Instagram last week.

But I digress.

Within minutes, the gossip site’s squib on the TV star’s alleged victimization trended on Twitter and rocketed up to USA Today, Variety, CBS, CNN and The New York Times. The Fishwrap of Record breathlessly reported lurid details of two people who “wrapped rope around his neck,” which multiple outlets characterized as a “noose.” A police statement providing incident background stated that “the offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,” according to Smollett. Multiple websites reported that the substance was bleach.

This is truly horrible, if true. But color me cautious and skeptical. TMZ initially reported that Smollett had exited a Subway chain restaurant near his luxury apartment when accosted by the racist, homophobic assailants, who allegedly recognized him from his work on “Empire.” Allegedly, Smollett received a hate mail with the word “MAGA” on it addressed to him and sent to his studio in Chicago last week. If this was a premeditated attack, the FBI should get to the bottom of it.

But oddities and discrepancies abound:

TMZ quoted one of the “MAGA country” attackers who allegedly hurled epithets at Smollett: “Aren’t you that f——t ‘Empire’ n——-?”

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces wander around the upscale Streeterville neighborhood of liberal Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying rope and bleach, yelling about “MAGA country”?

Question: How many racist homophobic menaces have ever heard of “Empire,” could recognize Jussie Smollett, or know or care anything about his sexuality?

Despite TMZ’s claim that Smollett had the “hell beat outta him” and attackers “broke his ribs” plus subjected him to a chemical attack, an ambulance was not called and he instead “self-transported” to the hospital. CWB Chicago, a local public safety watchdog site, reported on police dispatch records documenting that Smollett’s friend “Frank” refused EMS services for Smollett; no mention of bleach was made; “no or minor injury” was observed; and “officers never sent a ‘flash; message with offender descriptions to field units.”

Weird.

Another assertion not included in the CPD’s initial press release on the incident: Any mention of “MAGA supporters” or any mention of the race of the alleged assailants. Police clarified that they had not received any official information backing TMZ reporter Charles Latibeaudiere’s claim, which he attributed to sources close to Smollett, that the alleged attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

Nor had the police corroborated that the attackers were white, since Smollett had told them their faces and hands were both covered. After launching a search for surveillance video and potential witnesses, the police department reported late Tuesday that “thus far we have not found anything to be able to put out a description.”

I was told that public records requests for the incident report may take “weeks” to be approved. I was also told the Chicago police remain in charge of investigating the alleged incident, while the FBI probe of the alleged hate mail remains separate

CPD’s public information office also told me late Tuesday that when police responded to the 911 call regarding the incident, Smollett gave them no details about where it occurred or what the attackers looked like. None. They were reportedly on scene for an hour with Smollett. When I asked again how the claims about white “MAGA attackers” were disseminated in the press, the PIO replied:

“We have no idea where that came from.”

Minutes after I hung up the phone with her, a local Chicago reporter tweeted that Smollett did mention the “MAGA” angle in a “follow-up, supplemental interview.” Which is it?

Despite all the holes, contradictions and unanswered questions, the MAGA hate crime narrative has already calcified. (Sound familiar?) By 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, a search for “MAGA” and “Smollett” on Google yielded 3,520,000 results. And TMZ ended its day of social justice pot-stirring with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for President Donald Trump to “denounce Jussie Smollett’s MAGA attackers” who have yet to be identified.

Classic manufactured “news:” Report on an uncorroborated hate crime. Plant unverified details. Repeatedly blame white male Trump supporters. Stoke Hollywood outrage. Enlist the godfather of hate crime hoaxes to call on the president to denounce phantom attackers. Reap clicks and publicity. Indict all skeptics as racists and haters. Repeat.

Smears first. Facts later. How much deader can American journalism get?

Ralph Northam‘s medical school yearbook page from 1984, which contained a photograph of two unidentified men, one in blackface and the other in a Ku Klux Klan costume. There have been calls to resign, but the governor refuses.

On Friday, Northam released a statement, which read, “I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now. This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians’ faith in that commitment.”

Ralph Northam, Virginia Governor, Admits He Was in Racist Photo pic.twitter.com/T9XZ3zbHQH — Maggie Kaigler (@newsgirl123456) February 2, 2019

He also added, “I recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused. I am ready to do that important work. The first step is to offer my sincerest apology and to state my absolute commitment to living up to the expectations Virginians set for me when they elected me to be their Governor.”

Northam admitted he was in the photo but did not say if he was the person in blackface or dressed as member of the KKK, according to the New York Times.

Nonetheless, there have been several calls for him to resign. Sen. Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter, “Leaders are called to a higher standard, and the stain of racism should have no place in the halls of government. The Governor of Virginia should step aside so the public can heal and move forward together.”

Due to even more backlash, he released a video statement on Twitter that said, “My fellow Virginians, earlier today I released a statement apologizing for behavior in my past that falls far short of the standard you set for me when you elected me to be your governor. I believe you deserve to hear directly from me.” See the full video below:

The pressure if on for him to resigns. If he does, Justin Fairfax, the Lieutenant Governor, will become governor, which would make him Virginia’s first Black governor since 1989.

Tickets for the show have since sold out as the venue is said to only hold 400 people. The original price of $20-$35 was then bumped up to $70 and more for any remaining unsold tickets. If anything changes, the concert booker assures ticket holders they will be told as soon as possible. As of now, the show will go on.

According to TMZ, Smollett plans to address the attack making specific references to homophobia, racism and MAGA.

The Chicago Police Department continues to investigate after releasing screenshots from surveillance footage showing grainy images of the two men they want to bring in for questioning.

What it says is how far society has to go to achieve true diversity. Of course, a lot of these problems go back generations and throughout institutions — for instance, education and disinvestment in communities. But at some point, if people truly do value diversity in their industries and believe it’s a business imperative, they have to take chances and make investments in ways they never have before. It’s also important to remember that even the most liberal-minded people who profess the importance of diversity don’t always get it right. — J.E.

In many ways, the story isn’t about one law firm. It’s about institutions that have to be the best, but they also have to make space for people who have been historically excluded for racist or sexist reasons.

I think one point that was important to those who spoke was debunking the myth that you needed to sacrifice on quality in order to become diverse. Having multiple perspectives in leadership at a law firm helped firms do better work, people told us. As such, they felt it would only work in the firms’ best interests to do things in a more inclusive way. — J.E.

New York: Members of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer) and Black communities gathered at a rally here to express solidarity with “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, days after he was the victim of a hate crime in Chicago.

Labelled as a solidarity event, the rally’s organisers on Friday aimed to show public support both for Smollett and for the larger community of LGBTQ survivors of violence, according to the Facebook event listing and Jason Walker, HIV/AIDS campaign coordinator for Vocal-NY and the rally’s lead organiser, reports hollywoodreporter.com.

The two-hour rally featured over 15 speakers and was co-sponsored by more than 40 various city, state and national organisations focusing on LGBTQ and racially marginalised communities.

Walker began the event with the chant: “When queer communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back. When people of colour are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.”

Representatives from various advocacy groups each took over the megaphone, delivering speeches demanding an end to violent attacks like those on Smollett.

Beyond speaking out for Smollett and LGBTQ people of colour, speakers primarily used their time to address what they described as a growing movement of violence against LGBTQ, black, and other marginalised communities under the current presidential administration.

Several speakers directly pointed to US President Donald Trump and both the language and policies as the fuel for the attack on Smollett. “The Jussie Smollett attack was politically motivated, and that represents where we are sociopolitically,” said Walker.

Before Friday, Smollett had not commented on the racist and homophobic attack he experienced last week in Chicago after two men beat him, poured an unknown substance all over him and put a noose around his neck.

In the actor’s first statement since the incident, he echoed many of the sentiments shared at the rally, telling Essence that his experience is representative of a larger issue.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett said."

Jesse Jackson: 'Hate and violence are raining down on our country'

Donald Trump has energized violent bigots including those allegedly behind a horrific attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who was attacked last week in Chicago in what authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has told the Guardian.

The alleged assault, which Jackson called an attempted “barbaric lynching”, was the latest in a line of hate attacks, including the antisemitic mass shooting last year at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Jackson said. And, according to Jackson, the president, with his words and actions, has fostered an environment where hatred has thrived and violence has been “encouraged”.

“The spirit of demeaning and bullying has been revived,” Jackson said in a phone interview, adding that he believed Trump was pushing the country towards “a crisis”.

Smollett, who is black and gay, was allegedly attacked on Tuesday in Chicago, where he lives while filming the hit Fox drama series Empire, by two men in ski masks. According to Chicago police, the alleged assailants yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” at the actor, battered him, and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him.

They then tied a noose around his neck and, according to Smollett, yelled “this is Maga country” – an apparent reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Trump has condemned the assault, calling it “horrible”.

But, Jackson said, Trump’s bigoted rhetoric and agenda have emboldened bigots and set the table for such incidents.

“Hate and violence are raining down on our country,” Jackson said. “The rain is falling from the top.”

Other prominent activists and celebrities, including the actress Ellen Page, have drawn similar connections between Trump and incidents like the one on Smollett. The LGBT and environmental activist made waves during a television appearance Thursday with a powerful denunciation of Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence’s agenda, saying the leaders “want to cause suffering” in already marginalized communities.

“This needs to fucking stop,” Page said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

In the wake of this week’s alleged attack, Smollett – who told Essence magazine in a statement that he is “OK” – has received an outpouring of support from across the country and in Chicago, a diverse city nevertheless plagued by segregation, where local activists say that the actor’s assault underscores that such incidents can happen even in purportedly progressive spaces.

“It goes to show that we have a lot more work to do than we think,” said Mariah Emerson of the Center on Halsted, an LGBT community center in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood. “Chicago’s a pretty progressive city, but this is deeper than politics. It’s deeper than policy. It’s a personal, and it’s not going to go away just because we seem like a blue city or we vote a certain way or we seem more liberal.”

In a statement Thursday, Smollett’s family called the attack a “hate crime” and said it highlights how widespread such “domestic terrorism” against marginalized groups is in America.

“We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,” the family said.

In his own statement on Friday, Smollett said he is physically safe after the attack and that he’s confident “justice will be served” – in spite of what he said were “frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread”.

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett told Essence. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

“During times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love,” the 36-year-old actor added. “It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”"

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The parents of a Penn State sophomore who died two years ago after a night of drinking and hazing have sued 28 members of a shuttered fraternity and a security company hired to help enforce alcohol regulations. Lawyers for Tim Piazza’s parents announced the federal wrongful death lawsuit Friday and also disclosed they have reached a confidential monetary settlement with Penn State. The lawsuit says that the night of Feb. 2, 2017, Piazza was pressured to consume a large amount of alcohol in the Beta Theta Pi house and “became stuporous.”

“The fraternity defendants negligently, recklessly, and outrageously forced, coerced, encouraged or otherwise caused Pennsylvania State University sophomore Timothy Piazza to consume life-threatening amounts of alcohol, and caused him to become intoxicated, fall and suffer grievous injuries and death,” the lawsuit alleges. “For more than 11 hours after his fall, Timothy Piazza endured horrible pain and suffering, which was documented by closed-circuit cameras.” Authorities say Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, New Jersey, suffered fatal injuries in a series of falls. Medical help was not summoned until the next morning.

The building’s elaborate system of security cameras captured events as Piazza and other pledges engaged in drinking rituals. After Piazza fell down the basement steps he had to be carried up to a first-floor couch, where he spent the evening and overnight in visible agony. He was found to have suffered a fractured skull and severe abdominal bleeding, among other injuries. Not all defendants in the new federal lawsuit face the same allegations. The Piazzas allege negligence, civil conspiracy, battery and infliction of emotional distress.

The battery claims involve allegations that fraternity members physically abused Piazza while he was incapacitated.

A lawyer for St. Moritz Security Services declined comment. Messages sent to lawyers for several of defendants were not immediately returned. St. Moritz employed people who were paid to make checks of fraternity houses to see if they were complying with rules concerning hazing and drinking. A Penn State spokeswoman said its settlement with the Piazzas, who had not sued the school, codifies the university’s reforms to fraternity and sorority life and shows “our mutual commitment to promoting positive change.”

The agreement touches on safety and accountability for fraternities and sororities, encouragement of alcohol-free housing and continued training for bystander intervention and other preventative measures.

Piazza’s death resulted in criminal charges against 28 members of Beta Theta Pi, in many cases the same young men who were sued on Thursday. Nearly all of those criminal charges have been resolved. Some have pleaded guilty to mostly alcohol- or hazing-related charges and others have entered a diversion program designed for first-time, nonviolent offenders. A few defendants still face charges, but no trials are currently scheduled.

ATLANTA (AP) — Gladys Knight says her singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl will bring people together. NBC’s “Today” show reported Friday that Knight wrestled with whether to join a boycott over the NFL’s treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem. Kaepernick attorney Mark Geragos said the performers are “crossing an intellectual picket line; they’re saying to themselves, ‘I care more about my career than whether what I’m doing is right.'”

Knight said she’s been working for civil rights and singing the anthem since she was a little girl. Knight says everyone has an opinion, “but once we get into that love thing, it all comes together and goes wherever and we end up clapping and having a good time.”

NEW YORK (AP) — One of the book world’s greatest mysteries is finally ending: J.D. Salinger’s son says previously unpublished work by his late father will be coming out. In comments that appeared Friday in The Guardian, Matt Salinger confirmed longstanding reports that the author of “The Catcher in the Rye” had continued to write decades after he stopped publishing books. He said that he and Salinger’s widow, Colleen, are “going as fast as we freaking can” to prepare the material for release.

“He wanted me to pull it together, and because of the scope of the job, he knew it would take a long time,” Salinger said of his father, who died in 2010 and had not published work since the mid-1960s. “This was somebody who was writing for 50 years without publishing, so that’s a lot of material. So there’s not reluctance or protectiveness: When it’s ready, we’re going to share it,” he said.

CHICAGO (AP) — First he was attacked on the street. Now “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says he’s being beaten up on social media. Smollett has issued a statement disputing rumors flying around online that he’s been less than forthcoming with police in Chicago investigating the attack. He says he has been honest and “consistent on every level” with authorities.

Smollett told police he was set upon early Tuesday by two men who peppered their blows with racist and anti-gay language. So far, authorities haven’t turned up surveillance video showing the attack. But they have found clips of Smollett returning to his apartment with a rope around his neck — a rope he says his assailants put on him. Meanwhile, authorities continue scouring through surveillance video in an effort to find those responsible for the attack.

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett issued a statement through a spokesman Friday in response to what he told police was a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago earlier this week. Here it is:

“Beautiful People,

Let me start by saying that I’m ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

With Love, respect & honor…

Jussie.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has resonated with many people. That’s because he is, like the character he plays on TV, both black and gay — and he says his attackers not only beat him, but also hurled racist and anti-gay comments at him. This evening, members of black and gay right organizations are literally rallying to his defense. Several black activist and LGBTQ groups are planning to hold a rally in New York City. Organizers say they will demonstrate against attacks on Smollett and other victims of violent hate crimes.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Mariah Carey continues to get blowback for performing a concert in Saudi Arabia. She is the biggest star to take the stage in the kingdom since it began loosening decades of restrictions on entertainment, music and other forms of fun. But some activists say Carey was used — or let herself be used — by the Saudi government to polish its image after last year’s killing and dismemberment of a Saudi journalist who wrote for The Washington Post. For her part, Carey, through her reps, says she sees yesterday’s concert as a way to advance gender equality. Some critics have begun reaching out to Carey directly — through her Twitter account.

Earlier this week, Empire star Jussie Smollett was attacked in what is being treated as a suspected hate crime. According to TMZ, the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to the Make America Great Again acronym often used by President Trump.

The attackers placed a noose around Smollett’s neck, began to punch him, and pour an unknown substance over him during the unprovoked attack, according to Chicago police.

They also hurled homophobic and racist slurs at him.

Speaking through Essence, Smollett said: “Let me start by saying that I’m OK.

*Killer Mike chopped it up with the hosts of Power 105.1’s “Breakfast Club” Thursday morning about real estate, interracial relationships, and his provocative Netflix docuseries, “Trigger Warning.” But things got heated between the Atlanta rapper/entrepreneur and DJ Envy when the conversation turned to education and whether it’s beneficial or harmful to send Black children to private school.

As reported by jasminebrand.com, Killer Mike said:

“Why are we not supporting historically Black colleges and universities? That’s where our heroes went! That’s where they came from! Dr. King went to Booker T. Washington. You gon’ show me a n*gga smarter than him? I don’t have no problems with you loving your children, but my children go to public school. ‘Cause I pay taxes in public school, and they named for Black people. And either you gonna choose to be excellent, and you gonna do better – or you gon’ sit your chump a** down and you gon’ keep being the same sh*t over and over. But you can’t complain and say that greatness wasn’t given to you. If you walk in a school named for Frederick Douglas High School, and you do not have the initiative as a parent or the student to walk up and step up to that greatness, but you’ll do it at St. Pius? Man, you a chump!”

DJ Envy, who sends his children to private school, disagreed:

“Don’t put words in my mouth. I don’t put words in your’s. I’m not mad. I let you speak. I let you give your spiel. I’ve been to public school…My kids go to private school, right? My son has his own business, has his own thing- things that I didn’t learn before. You know why? Because those opportunities were given to him.”

It wasn’t long before their debate became the ninth hottest topic at the time of the show. DJ Envy shared a screenshot the trending top list on his Instagram Story (see above).

Despite the heated exchange, DJ Envy and Killer Mike insist there’s no love lost between them. Both commented on their conversation on the ‘gram:

Days after allegedly being brutally attacked, “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has issued his first statement since the assault.

Smollett, 35, says two unidentified men attacked him on his way out of a Subway restaurant in Chicago at around 2 A.M. on Tuesday. Smollett reportedly told police that the men, who were wearing ski masks at the time, hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him during the attack, doused him with what may have been bleach, and left a noose around his neck.

Breaking his silence for the first time since then, Smollett assured his fans and supporters that he’s “OK” in a statement issued to Essence on Friday.

“My body is strong but my soul is stronger,” he said. “More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett reportedly told police that his attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country,” as they left. Smollett appeared to address speculation online that his story has been inconsistent, writing, “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” his statement reads. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Following the attack, the actor is said to have transported himself to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries, which reportedly included a fractured rib. The alleged assailants, two white men, are still at large. Chicago police are currently investigating the incident, having released surveillance photos of two men who they believe to be people of interest in the case.

Smollett’s words come a day after his family issued a joint statement describing the attack as a “racial and homophobic hate crime” and calling for more awareness of the violence minorities face. His “Empire” co-stars, like Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, have also expressed their support for the actor on social media, and on Thursday, President Donald Trump called the assault “horrible.”

Virginia governor faces calls to resign over racist yearbook photo

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is expected to face more backlash Saturday after he acknowledged that he appeared in a photo that showed a man dressed in blackface and another person wearing a Ku Klux Klan robe and hood. The photo, which appears in a 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook, caused an instant firestorm encircling Northam and leading to loud, bipartisan calls for his immediate resignation. Organizations and lawmakers, including some presidential contenders in the 2020 race like Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, joined together asking him to step down. Northam, who issued video and written statements apologizing for the photo on Friday, did not intend to heed calls to resign, stating his: ""absolute commitment to living up to the expectations Virginians set for me when they elected me to be their Governor.""

Groundhog Day: Phil predicts an early spring

In the wake of the polar vortex plunging the northern USA into a deep freeze, many meteorologists were convinced Punxsutawney Phil would predict six more weeks of winter on Groundhog Day. But instead, Phil did not see his shadow on Saturday morning, which tradition says is a sign we’re in for an early spring. The prognosticating rodent will made his call shortly before 7:30 a.m. ET on a hill outside Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, known as Gobbler's Knob. It's only the 19th time out of 123 in his recorded history that Phil hasn't been able to find his shadow.

California braces for powerful, dangerous storm

With the polar vortex in full retreat, a powerful and dangerous rainstorm is forecast to batter the western United States over the weekend, especially in California. Heavy rain could trigger mudslides, rockslides and floods, while feet of snow will bury the mountains, the National Weather Service warned. Forecasters say rain will last through Saturday as flash flooding and debris flows will be a concern, particularly near burn scar areas. ""Southern California residents, in or below the recently burned areas, are urged to take the steps necessary to protect their property,"" the weather service said. Meanwhile, up to 10 feet of snow could fall in the Sierra Nevada, where ""travel is highly discouraged."" Winter storm warnings were in effect for hundreds of miles of mountainous regions of California, all the way from the Oregon border to north of Los Angeles.

'Empire' star Jussie Smollett to perform in L.A. concert days after attack

Nearly a week after Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by two masked men in what his family and Chicago police are treating as a hate crime, the ""Empire"" star broke his silence Friday. In his statement, obtained by USA TODAY, Smollett, 36, said he's feeling better and thanked the ""outpouring of love and support"" he received after the attack. On Thursday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives had recovered surveillance-camera footage of Smollett arriving home at his apartment with a rope around his neck. He said the video was recorded minutes after the actor said he was attacked. Smollett indicated he still plans to perform at a sold-out concert at the Troubador, a legendary music venue in West Hollywood, California."

The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime.

News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in the statement.

Chicago police said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on ""Empire,"" was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying ""This is MAGA country"" in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

""Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""The victim didn't provide them.""

However, he also said the police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

Another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said in a later email: ""The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.""

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since ""these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.""

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said some of the statements made by Chicago police sought to undermine the credibility of Smollett's allegations.

""So far, Chicago Police have risked discouraging other survivors of hate crimes from coming forward,"" said Clarke, whose organization seeks to secure equal justice for all.Several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York on Friday evening organized by gay rights groups.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

""I think being gay and black in this country, it's very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,"" Perkins said. ""It seems like we're just going backwards to the '60s again."""

“That I can tell you is horrible,” president Donald Trump said Thursday when asked about the violent and homophobic attack on Smollett that seemingly occurred early in AM on Tuesday.

“It doesn’t get worse,” the President weirdly added.

Trump’s comment comes in the wake of Chicago police released video surveillance images of what they call “people of interest” in the January 29 beating of Smollett from two as yet unidentified individuals.

As has been reported, Smollett had just returned to the city where the Fox drama is shot, and was on the street near his Chicago apartment at around 2 AM when two suspects began bellowing derogatory slurs towards him. The duo then attacked the actor, hitting him over and over and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him They also reportedly stringing a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove himself to Northwestern Hospital. He returned to his home under increased security later Tuesday and was said to be in good condition, police said.

The Chicago police announced on Tuesday that they are treating the matter as a “possible hate crime.”

Here’s more via Deadline:

Smollett’s music manager Brandon Z. Moore is among those who say that the attackers were screaming “this MAGA country” against the actor who plays the openly gay Jamel Lyon on the Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard led Empire. “Make America Great Again” is, of course, Trump’s defining rally cry and remains his go to phrase on the stump or in the Oval Office. The President did not address the use of that term by the attackers, which was not been confirmed by the Chicago Police it should be added.

Though trauma counselors were on-hand for Empire cast, crew and producers on Tuesday when the assault on Smollett became known, the show went on hiatus soon afterwards. That break is not due to Smollett’s situation but due to the harsh cold of the polar vortex that has hit Chicago and much of the Midwest this week. The weather is still bone chillingly cold in the Windy City but Empire and fellow locally shot Fox series Proven Innocent are both back in production today, I hear.

Depending on his recovery and weather conditions, Smollett could be back filming Empire by early next week. The performer is still scheduled to play a gig in West Hollywood on Saturday."

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

CHICAGO – “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home – including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck – they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack – even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

Law enforcement sources tell The Blast, the L.A. County Sheriff's department is very aware that Smollett is performing Saturday night at The Troubadour, and will ramp up patrols around the venue.

We're told sheriffs will be monitoring the situation to make sure everyone is safe and has a fun time during the performance, and are also asking for anyone who sees suspicious activity to report it immediately.

It's unclear if The Troubadour will also be beefing up security, but it wouldn't be surprising, considering the national attention Smollett's attack has garnered.

Smollett is expected to perform hits from his album, SUM OF MY MUSIC. He may also speak on the alleged racial and homophobic attack in Chicago, that left him with a noose around his neck and bleach thrown in his face.

Releasing a statement for the first time since the incident, Smollett told fans he was ""ok,"" and believes that ""justice will be served."" As we reported, police have released a shadowy photo of two men as persons of interest, but they have not yet been identified.

Still, cops in West Hollywood are working to ensure Smollett's first performance back in town is safe for everyone."

Chicago - Actor Jussie Smollett on Friday defended as completely truthful the account he gave of being accosted on a Chicago street by men who used racist and homophobic slurs, and said he was cooperating with police. The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime. News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggesting it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained. ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in the statement. In a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday, Chicago police said the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on ""Empire,"" was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital, but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

""Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to Reuters. ""The victim didn't provide them.""

But he also said the police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

In a later email, another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said: ""The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.""

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since ""these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.""

On Friday evening, several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York organised by gay rights groups in Manhattan's Grand Army Plaza, near Central Park.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

""I think being gay and black in this country, it’s very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,” Perkins said. “It seems like we’re just going backwards to the ‘60s again.”

Jussie Smollett broke his silence on Friday morning after he was reportedly the victim of a racist and homophobic assault.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett told Essence in a Friday statement. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett also addressed the skepticism about the attack, telling Essence that he has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level” with authorities.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he said.

Chicago Police reported on Tuesday that the ” Empire ” actor was attacked by two unidentified masked men in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Smollett was reportedly walking to get food around 2 a.m. when the two attackers approached him and began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” according to police.

Smollett told police that the two men beat him up, “poured an unknown chemical substance,” believed to be bleach , on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said the men yelled “MAGA country” during the attack, an apparent reference to President Donald Trump ’s slogan “Make American Great Again.”

Smollett, a gay black man, was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the assault, but was in “good condition” according to police reports.

The “Empire” actor said he will address the specifics of the “horrific incident” soon, but he needed time to process the experience.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett said.

“We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Smollett’s family released a statement in support of the actor and addressed rumors about the truthfulness of the attack.

“We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” Smollett’s family said in the Thursday statement. “Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Trump briefly commented on the attack in a Thursday press conference, telling journalist April Ryan: “That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” Chicago police said in a Tuesday statement to HuffPost. “Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.”

The FBI has taken over the investigation in the wake of news that Smollett received a threatening letter prior to the attack. Chicago police have released images of “persons of interest,” but as of Friday morning had not publicly released any more leads.

Smollett told police that he was beaten by two men who screamed Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan on the streets of Chicago, before they tied a noose around his neck and then poured an unknown chemical substance onto him.

""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope you will all stand with me.""

Labelled as a solidarity event, the rally's organisers on Friday aimed to show public support both for Smollett and for the larger community of LGBTQ survivors of violence, according to the Facebook event listing and Jason Walker, HIV/AIDS campaign coordinator for Vocal-NY and the rally's lead organiser, reports hollywoodreporter.com.

The two-hour rally featured over 15 speakers and was co-sponsored by more than 40 various city, state and national organisations focusing on LGBTQ and racially marginalised communities.

Walker began the event with the chant: ""When queer communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back. When people of colour are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.""

Representatives from various advocacy groups each took over the megaphone, delivering speeches demanding an end to violent attacks like those on Smollett.

Beyond speaking out for Smollett and LGBTQ people of colour, speakers primarily used their time to address what they described as a growing movement of violence against LGBTQ, black, and other marginalised communities under the current presidential administration.

Several speakers directly pointed to US President Donald Trump and both the language and policies as the fuel for the attack on Smollett.

""The Jussie Smollett attack was politically motivated, and that represents where we are sociopolitically,"" said Walker.

Before Friday, Smollett had not commented on the racist and homophobic attack he experienced last week in Chicago after two men beat him, poured an unknown substance all over him and put a noose around his neck.

In the actor's first statement since the incident, he echoed many of the sentiments shared at the rally, telling Essence that his experience is representative of a larger issue.

""As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily... I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,"" Smollett said.

Beyond speaking out for Smollett and LGBTQ people of colour, speakers primarily used their time to address what they described as a growing movement of violence against LGBTQ, black, and other marginalised communities under the current presidential administration.

Several speakers directly pointed to US President Donald Trump and both the language and policies as the fuel for the attack on Smollett.

“The Jussie Smollett attack was politically motivated, and that represents where we are sociopolitically,” said Walker.

Before Friday, Smollett had not commented on the racist and homophobic attack he experienced last week in Chicago after two men beat him, poured an unknown substance all over him and put a noose around his neck.

In the actor’s first statement since the incident, he echoed many of the sentiments shared at the rally, telling Essence that his experience is representative of a larger issue.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily… I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett said.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed rumours levelled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,"" he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement.

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighbourhood as he was walking home from a restaurant.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven't found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love and support"" he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it ""horrible."" But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn't cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett's refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he was on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

Police have not suggested that Smollett or his manager have been untruthful in any way. On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven't found video of the attack, Smollett has been ""very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he's not being genuine with us.""

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn't be unusual that such an attack wouldn't be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn't provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don't continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

""Somewhere out there there's a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,"" he said, pointing out that the two aren't considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence.

Smollett is scheduled to play a sold-out show at the famous Troubador Saturday night but his planned meet-and-greet session has been cancelled.

This was made known yesterday, February 1st afternoon when an email was sent to all ticketholders. The email says meet and greet ticketholders can get a refund or donate the cost of the ticket to the Black AIDS Institute. The mail reads in part,

“For security reasons we cannot accommodate any meet and greets.”

The email doesn’t refer to any specific threat. Read the email below,

GOVERNOR-KLAN-BLACKFACE

Gov. Northam says he wasn’t in racist photo, won’t resign

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has resisted widespread calls for him to step down over a racist photograph that appeared in his medical school yearbook.

The photo on Northam’s profile page features someone in blackface and someone in KKK robes.

He denies being in the photo, even though on Friday he had apologized and said he was in it.

During a news conference Saturday, Northam admitted to wearing blackface while he was dressed as Michael Jackson during a 1984 dance contest in Texas.

Northam said he regrets he didn’t understand “the harmful legacy of an action like that.”

After he spoke, both of Virginia’s U.S. senators said they called Northam to tell him that he must resign, as he had “irrevocably broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders.”

IMMIGRATION-SEPARATING FAMILIES

US sees limitations on reuniting migrant families

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration says it would require extraordinary effort to reunite what may be thousands of migrant children who have been separated from their parents and, even if it could, the children would likely be emotionally harmed.

Health and Human Services Department officials said in court filings late Friday that removing children from “sponsor” homes to rejoin their parents would endanger their welfare. The officials say they don’t have authority to take children away from sponsors and that the effort would be cost-prohibitive.

The government didn’t adequately track separated children before a judge in San Diego ruled in June that children in its custody be reunited with their parents.

The American Civil Liberties Union wants the order to apply to children who were separated before June. Officials say there may be thousands.

VENEZUELA-POLITICAL CRISIS-THE LATEST

The Latest: Thousands rally in Spain to support Guaido

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Several thousand Venezuelans rallied in central Spain’s capital of Madrid Saturday to show their support for Juan Guaido, the self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela.

Former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma, who escaped a Venezuelan prison and fled to Spain in 2017, attended the rally in opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The gathering coincided with a major rally Guaido held in Venezuela, where tens of thousands of supporters in Caracas demanded that Maduro step down from power.

Loyalists of Maduro’s socialist government flooded the streets in a different part Caracas to celebrate 20 years since Hugo Chavez launched the Bolivarian revolution.

There was another smaller rally for Guaido in Barcelona, Spain’s second largest city.

The number of people born in Venezuela who live in Spain has jumped from 165,000 in 2015 to 255,000 last year, according to Spain’s National Institute of Statistics.

CALIFORNIA STORMS-THE LATEST

The Latest: Southbound lanes of US 101 reopen, Caltrans says

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California Department of Transportation says in a tweet that the southbound lanes of U.S. 101, a vital route between Los Angeles and points north and west, have been reopened, while the northbound lanes of the highway remain closed from State Route 150 to Milpas.

Earlier Saturday, in the Montecito area of Santa Barbara County, several miles of U.S 101 were closed because of flooding.

SEXUAL MISCONDUCT-STATE LEGISLATURES

A new year in legislatures brings same story on harassment

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Complaints of sexual misconduct are continuing to mount in state legislatures as the 2019 sessions begin and lawmakers consider whether to add safeguards against harassment.

Claims in a handful of states make it clear that the #MeToo movement was not a one-year phenomenon in many state capitols.

Some states are taking their first steps since the October 2017 reports alleging sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked a national movement.

The Associated Press has tallied at least 90 state lawmakers who have resigned or been expelled, faced other repercussions or been publicly accused of sexual misconduct since the beginning of 2017.

TRUMP-SENATE INFLUENCE

Senate reasserts foreign policy role, influence Trump agenda

WASHINGTON (AP) — Two years into Donald Trump’s presidency, his allies in Congress are quietly trying to influence and even reshape his “America First” foreign policy agenda.

The Republican-led Senate is reasserting itself as a check on Trump’s instincts. And individual lawmakers are seeking sway. It’s the GOP’s defense hawks vying with noninterventionists over policy in the Middle East, Latin America and beyond.

The Senate’s first bill of the new year reaffirms sanctions on Syrian officials involved in war crimes. And it soon will include an amendment pushing back on Trump’s plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan.

Some say it’s time for Congress to reassert its role in foreign policy.

ORLANDO AIRPORT-SECURITY

TSA officer jumps to his death at Orlando airport

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — An officer from the Transportation Security Administration has jumped to his death from a balcony inside Florida’s busiest airport, creating panic that brought some security checkpoints to a halt for several hours.

The Orlando Police Department said Saturday that the TSA officer in his 40s died from an apparent suicide at Orlando International Airport.

The department described it as an isolated incident.

Panicked passengers rushed past checkpoints leading to about half of the airport’s gates after the man jumped. That led some checkpoints to close.

The airport tweeted that the passengers were returned for a second examination out of an abundance of caution.

The standstill and rescreening caused major delays. It warned passengers Saturday afternoon to give themselves plenty of time to go through security.

IMMIGRATION-FORCE-FEEDING

ICE force-feeding detainees on hunger strike

Three times a day, a 22-year-old Indian man on a hunger strike says, he is dragged from his cell in a Texas immigration detention center, his feet scraping the floor as he goes. He’s put on a bed where he says his arms and legs are strapped down and a group of people force-feed him by pouring liquid into tubes pushed through his nose.

The man is among a group of nine detainees in the El Paso facility who immigration officials acknowledged Friday are being hydrated and fed against their will under court orders. That’s up from six men who were being fed through nasal tubes Wednesday when the Associated Press first reported on the force-feeding.

In a statement, ICE said it fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference.

NFL HONORS-THE LATEST

The Latest: Chiefs QB Mahomes wins NFL MVP award

ATLANTA (AP) — It was a Patrick Mahomes runaway for NFL MVP.

In his second pro season, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes took The Associated Press 2018 NFL Most Valuable Player award. He received 41 votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league. New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees got the other nine in balloting announced at NFL Honors.

With only one previous start, Mahomes entered the season as something of a curiosity in Kansas City after the Chiefs traded veteran Alex Smith to open up the job. It didn’t take long to erase any doubts as Mahomes led the Chiefs to their first AFC title game since the 1993 season, throwing for 50 touchdowns, 5,097 yards and had a 113.8 QB rating, trailing only Brees.

“I’m so humbled,” he said. “This is just the beginning. We’ve got a long ways to go.”

Mahomes’ creativity — the guy can throw from all angles and make plays inside and outside the pocket — energized the Chiefs’ fan base and excited fans across the league.

“The play is never dead. He can find new ways to get you the ball,” Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce said. “It may look like a screwball, a slider here or there, but it’ll get to you eventually.”

Mahomes is the sixth straight quarterback and 11th of the last 12 years to win MVP. No Kansas City player had won the award since the Chiefs joined the NFL in 1970.

AP-US-GOVERNOR-KLAN-BLACKFACE-THE-LATEST

The Latest: Trump: Photo would’ve doomed Northam’s campaign

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — President Donald Trump says Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s Republican opponent would have easily won the 2017 governor’s race if the racist photo in Northam’s yearbook had been discovered during the campaign.

Trump tweeted Saturday night that Republican Ed Gillespie must believe his opposition research team committed “malpractice” and “dereliction of duty” by not uncovering the photo ahead of the 2017 election.

The photo on Northam’s medical school yearbook page shows one person in blackface and another hooded in white Ku Klux Klan regalia.

Northam defeated Gillespie by about 9 percentage points, but Trump says Gillespie would have won by 20 points if someone had found the photo.

Oscar adds more nominated songs

The Oscar-nominated songs ""I'll Fight"" from ""RBG"" and ""The Place Where Lost Things Go"" from ""Mary Poppins Returns"" will be performed during the Feb. 24 Oscars ceremony after all.

Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson will sing ""I'll Fight"" and ""a surprise special guest"" will perform ""The Place Where Lost Things Go,"" the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced via Twitter.

The news comes after a backlash from numerous stars when the academy said it would spotlight only two of the nominees in the best original song category. Those songs were ""All the Stars"" from ""Black Panther"" and ""Shallow"" from ""A Star Is Born.""

Deadline reports, ""Lady Gaga herself, or her reps, made it clear she felt it was completely unfair to eliminated the three songs and that she wouldn't perform (""Shallow"") if a change wasn't made.""

Variety has reported that, ""When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings"" from ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" would also be performed.

Jobless role pays off for Grant's career

Oscar nominee Richard E. Grant said playing an out-of-work actor has led to almost every job he's ever had.

Grant is nominated for best supporting actor for his performance alongside Melissa McCarthy in ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" It's the first nomination for the actor.

On Thursday night, Grant, 61, attended a screening at Manhattan's Film Forum of his film debut, ""Withnail & I."" In the 1987 British comedy, he plays a hard-drinking and unemployed thespian. Grant credited the film for his three-decade career.

Grant thinks Mahershala Ali will win best supporting actor, but he says he's going to enjoy every minute of being an Oscar nominee leading up to the Feb. 24 ceremony.

Knight says anthem will unite U.S.

Gladys Knight says her singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl will bring people together.

NBC's ""Today"" show reported Friday that Knight wrestled with whether to join a boycott over the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the anthem.

Kaepernick attorney Mark Geragos said performers are ""crossing an intellectual picket line; they're saying to themselves, 'I care more about my career than whether what I'm doing is right.'""

Knight said she's been working for civil rights and singing the anthem since she was a little girl.

Smollett noted that he is working with authorities and has been upfront and consistent with them, saying, “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe justice will be served.”

He added, “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love, It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

TMZ also notes that despite some reports to the contrary, Smollett did not refuse to hand over his phone records to police, but instead didn’t want to give them his actual phone. Police informally asked if he would surrender the phone and he was uncomfortable with that, but has already said he will provide phone recordd and is gathering them. The phone records are to confirm his account that he was speaking with his manager when he was attacked.

Smollett also did not tell police that his attackers were wearing MAGA hats, but that they instead yelled, as the initial report claims, “This is MAGA country.”"

CHICAGO, Feb 2 — Actor Jussie Smollett defended as completely truthful the account he gave of being accosted on a Chicago street by men who used racist and homophobic slurs and said on Friday he was cooperating with police.

The statement was the first Smollett has made publicly about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated by Chicago police as a possible hate crime.

News of the bizarre incident spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested it was a hoax after police were unable to find videotape of the attack Smollett said he sustained.

""I am working with authorities and have been 100 per cent factual and consistent on every level,"" Smollett said in the statement.

Chicago police said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday the actor had refused to turn over his cellphone records to detectives, although law enforcement officials later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, an openly gay African-American who plays a gay character on ""Empire,"" was accosted on a street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants doused him with a chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying ""This is MAGA country"" in an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

""Cellphone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""The victim didn't provide them.""

However, he also said the police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack.

Another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said in a later email: ""The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.""

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since ""these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.""

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said some of the statements made by Chicago police sought to undermine the credibility of Smollett's allegations.

""So far, Chicago Police have risked discouraging other survivors of hate crimes from coming forward,"" said Clarke, whose organization seeks to secure equal justice for all.

Several dozen people attended a rally for Smollett in New York on Friday evening organized by gay rights groups.

Danielle Perkins, an 18-year-old Brooklyn resident who will soon be heading to college to study journalism, said she came to the rally because Smollett reminded her of what she described as her own sense of vulnerability.

""I think being gay and black in this country, it's very difficult to get jobs, to live life, just to cross the street,"" Perkins said. ""It seems like we're just going backwards to the '60s again."" — Reuters"

Jussie Smollett has cancelled a meet & greet with fans in Los Angeles this weekend over concerns about his safety.

It comes just days after he was attacked in Chicago on Tuesday as he walked home from a Subway.

The actor, who is gay and black, was punched, had bleach on him and had noose put around his neck. He suffered a broken rib in the attack.

Moments later, he was filmed moments later walking into his building with the rope still on.

Jussie is playing a sold-out show at the famous Troubador on Saturday night ... and he was scheduled to have a meet-and-greet session but it has now been called off according to TMZ.

Ticketholders can get a refund or donate the cost of the ticket to the Black AIDS Institute.

An email was sent Friday afternoon to all ticketholders that reads, in part, 'For security reasons we cannot accommodate any meet & greets,' however, the email doesn't refer to any specific threat

'Jussie is so honored to perform for his fans, friends and family on Saturday night,' the email read. 'However, please forgive us. For security reasons we cannot accommodate any meet & greets. Your meet & greet upgrade can either be refunded, or donated to the Black AIDS Institute in your name … Thank you for understanding and thank you for your continuous love and support.'

'Photos (pictured) of people of interest who were in area of the alleged assault & battery of Empire cast member,' police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted Wednesday evening

On Friday, Smollett broke his silence to thank fans for the outpouring of support he has received since the attack.

The Empire star told Essence in a statement: 'Let me start by saying that I'm OK.

'My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you.

'The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.'

He added that while he was 'frustrated' with 'certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations' about the case, he believes 'justice will be served.'

'I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

'Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.

'With Love, respect & honor…Jussie,' he said.

It is the first time he has spoken since being targeted in downtown Chicago by two men who he said shouted 'this is MAGA country!' and attacked him as he walked home.

The attack was not captured on surveillance footage but Smollett was seen entering his apartment building moments after it happened with a rope around his neck.

He was on the phone to his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, when he was jumped and Moore corroborated his story earlier this week.

A week before the attack, Smollett reportedly received a homophobic and racist death threat in the mail.

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

Police are working to find two men they believe may be responsible and are appealing to the public for information.

Smollett's neighbor has also described seeing two suspicious 'redneck' types standing outside their luxury apartment building 90 minutes before the attack took place.

One had a rope hanging out of his sweatshirt, she said, and they looked out of place.

Smollett had not long arrived back in Chicago from New York City when he was attacked.

His flight was delayed by several hours leaving and he documented his frustration about the late arrival on Instagram before he got home.

He was filmed on surveillance cameras leaving the Subway at around 2am and walking towards the apartment.

Police on Thursday confirmed that he was filmed on the same street as the two persons of interest whose images have been released at one point during his journey home.

The 36-year-old actor was walking down the street and the two men were sitting on a bench facing opposite him.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore both told police they were on the phone when the attack happened. Moore said he heard the attackers yell 'this is MAGA country'. It is not clear if he is the person who called 911 or if it was someone else but Smollett refused to hand over his phone when police asked for it to verify that they had been on the phone

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, stating that 'You will die black f*g'. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

They got up and walked away and all three walked out of the cameras' view.

Smollett was picked back up by a different camera 60 seconds later as he entered his apartment building.

He had the rope around his neck and there was salt on the front of his sweatshirt from the ground.

At 2.35am, an associate of the actor's called 911 and officers arrived at an apartment where he was at 2.42am.

It is not clear if it was his apartment that they went to or his friend's.

After giving his statement, Smollett took himself to hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face.

The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it

Smollett, 36, who is also a singer, is due to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles

Police had asked him to turn over his phone for them to verify that he had been on a call with his manager, as both claimed, when the incident happened but he refused, saying he was uncomfortable doing so.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told DailyMail.com on Thursday that it was not suspicious for him to have refused doing so and that he may have been concerned with privacy.

He has been entirely cooperative otherwise, he said.

The attack has enraged the country and caught the attention of the president who deemed it 'horrible' on Thursday.

'That's horrible....there is nothing worse, as far as I am concerned,' Trump said on when asked about the incident.

Smollett's famous family released a statement abhorring the attack and countless celebrities, including his Empire co-stars, have also spoken out to support him.

He is due to perform a show in Los Angeles on Saturday night."

We have had a short hiatus waiting for the next new episode of Hawaii Five-0, but finally it’s back tonight and with an episode that’s going to give Flippa a little time in the spotlight since the case tonight will involve a friend of his.

Tonight’s episode gave us a small peek into Flippa’s life as he prepares for a gig with his band. He’s trying to buy some time before he hits the stage as his drummer (Luca) is running late to the show, but when he finally gets him on the phone he tells Flippa to stall just a few more minutes because he’s almost there. Unfortunately he never makes it to the gig because he was killed at the back of his van – stabbed 9 times. Clearly this is personal. When the team digs deeper they find a long blonde hair on him that belongs to a 15 year old girl (Annie) that he had been making large payments to. This is not looking good.

Luca turns out to be her therapist giving her money to help her after her parents tried to send her to conversion therapy for being gay. He was paying her lawyer to try to get Annie emancipated and help her get away from her parents and this conversion therapy. Now the parents have become a people of interest since they knew she was seeing Luca for help, but they are not the only ones when they find a young man named Conor straight out of prison with a special interest in hate crimes and a mobile bomb.

As it turns out this is a lot bigger then Luca – really this is about race and Conor’s involvement in a hate group that is ready to set off bombs in multiple cities to kill as many people as possible. Conor’s target is a children’s community center. The team is there in time and their is a fight over the grip detonator that he has when Grover takes the shot on Conor giving McGarrett a chance to get the detonator and save the kids.

CarterMatt Verdict

This was a really difficult episode to watch, we aren’t going to sugar coat it and especially with all the headlines recently with hate attacks (like what happened to jussie smollett) it made this all the harder to watch. Luckily Hawaii Five-0 is not a show to shy away from stories and as hard as it is to watch and talk about this stuff, it needs to be address. This was clearly something that the team was taking personally with Grover really taking it to heart because of a personal experience and while they’ve always come together for cases, it’s not all that often that we see everyone on the team as heated as they were tonight.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found a video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence. MKH

Reports on the attack have generated controversy due to conflicts about details of the assault and the ongoing investigation. Some early reports indicated that the assaulters yelled, “This is MAGA country,” though the Chicago Police issued a statement saying they had “no record” of such a claim. Some on social media have also suggested that Smollett has altered his story, a claim Smollett shot down assertively in his statement Friday.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to Essence Friday. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Choosing not to go into detail about what has been misrepresented, the actor moved on to the nature of the attack, which he described as part of a wider pattern.

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” he said. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

He concluded his statement by writing, “With Love, respect & honor…Jussie.”

The Boston Globe provides some more details on the shocking attack:

Smollett, 35, was walking on the 300th block of E. North Lower Water Street around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday, “when two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement to The Washington Post. ‘”The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim.” The police could not confirm the gender of the offenders nor identify the chemical substance.

The Chicago Police Department is investigating the attack as possibly motivated by racism and homophobia, and perhaps even premeditated; Smollett reportedly received a letter on January 18 stating, “You will die black f*g.”

Smollett’s family has also issued a statement on Instagram (formatting adjusted):

Because there’s a light in him that cannot be dimmed, because we are a family of joyful warriors, we will not let this get the best of us. Although this is a picture from happier times, this is the spirit to which we chose to move forward…they will not steal, our joy. Statement from our family: “ In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed. We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable. Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world.

With love & gratitude, The Smollett Family”

Smollett issued the statement after remaining silent about the alleged assault since media reports about it first surfaced on Tuesday. The matter is being investigated as a possible hate crime.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in his first statement about the incident he reported on Tuesday.

News of the police report spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggesting the story was a hoax.

In a statement emailed to Reuters late Thursday, Chicago police said Smollett had refused to turn over his cell phone records to detectives, although police later said he was working with investigators.

Smollett and his manager have both told police they were on the phone together when the actor, who plays a gay character on “Empire,” was accosted on a Chicago street early on Tuesday by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

According to the account he gave police, the two assailants doused Smollett with some kind of chemical liquid before wrapping a rope around his neck and fleeing the scene. The actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.

Police said they sought phone records to independently verify that Smollett was on the phone at the time with his manager, who reportedly told police he heard the attackers saying “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to Reuters. “The victim didn’t provide them.”

But police had “no reason to doubt” the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack, Guglielmi said.

In a later email, another police spokesman, Officer Michael Carroll, said, “The victim is working with police as we investigate the circumstances of the incident.”

Questions raised about the veracity of his account were troubling, Smollett said in his statement, especially since “these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily.”

“Empire” made its debut on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family who is the focus of the show.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett told Fox News in a statement, on Feb. 1. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

Smollett told police he was beaten by two men who uttered insults aimed at the actor’s racial identity and sexuality. He also said they threw an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and put a thin rope around his neck.

He returned to his apartment and had his manager call police, 40 minutes after the attack, according to Fox.

“That I can tell you is horrible,” President Trump said on Jan. 31 regarding the Smollett attack, via CNN. “I’ve seen it. Last night. It’s horrible. Doesn’t get worse.”

Police released images of two people walking in the area at the time of the attack, although the two people are not suspects, Fox reported.

Chicago has one of the most extensive video surveillance systems in the United States, but so far, police have not found any footage of the alleged attack, according to Fox.

Smollett and his manager told police they were on the phone with each other at the time of the attack, but they declined to give police phone records, Fox reported.

The singer will still perform at a concert in Los Angeles scheduled for Feb. 2, according to Fox.

Some prominent liberals are channelling outrage over the Smollett attack into hate for the president and the administration. They are blaming the president, vice president, and the administration for the alleged attack. Early reports indicated that the attackers shouted “MAGA country.”

Conservative comedian Terrence K. Williams found the circumstances reported around the attack odd.

“I don’t know one Trump supporter that say ‘ MAGA country.’

According to TMZ Smollett had the rope around his neck after the attack and walked home with it, as a way to supposedly preserve evidence. The TMZ report also says that Smollett is eventually planning to turn over phone records to police.

Another TMZ report says the attack took place at 2 a.m., after Smollett left a Subway sandwich shop.

A conservative writer expressed possible monetary or career motives behind reports of the attack.

Smollett reportedly refused extra security the week leading up to the attack. Fox offered him security during his off time, after a threatening letter was sent to the “Empire” studio and addressed to Smollett, Page Six reported.

The “Empire” cast members have now been given around-the-clock security, Inside Edition reported."

Actor Jussie Smollett tried to make it big for years, picking up roles in the smallest of films and working odd jobs to support his dreams. His breakthrough came when he was cast as Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox TV show Empire, where he stars as a gay musician who struggles to gain his father's approval and support. But his talent doesn't end at acting. Smollett also has experience with television directing and in music — and he has various awards to prove it. He's been the recipient or nominee of prestigious honors such as NAACP Awards and Teen Choice Awards.

But there's far more to this California-born creative than his professional accolades. He's notoriously private, and did you know that he starred in a film you probably watched over and over in the '90s? From his love life to his personal struggles, let's take a closer look at some of the things that have slipped under the radar. This is the untold truth of Jussie Smollett."

Ralph Northam's resignation. File Photo by Kevin Dietsch/UPI | License Photo

Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam apologized Friday for a 1984 yearbook photo of him he described as ""clearly racist and offensive,"" but declined to address calls for his resignation.

Northam's statement came after a conservative website, Big League Politics, posted an image of a Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook page apparently dedicated entirely to Northam. The page depicts photos of Northam and one photo of two unidentifiable people dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes and blackface.

Northam admitted he was in the offensive photo.

""I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,"" he said.

""This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians' faith in that commitment.

Northam's statement did not include a response to calls from both Democrats and Republicans that he resign.

Virginia state Sen. Bryce Reeves, a Republican, was among the first politicians condemning the image.

""This has no place in Virginia,"" he tweeted. ""If this is true, he should resign immediately.""

Taikein Cooper, chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Committee, said Northam should resign ""immediately.""

Northam ""can't champion racial reconciliation, during the 400-year anniversary of enslaved Americans being brought to Virginia, while being comfortable under the hood and/or blackface,"" he said."

Cardi, who recently reconciled with her husband, said, “It’s pretty cool, this is not my actual home, I'm a New Yorker, but all my peoples are from Atlanta… my husband… they all very excited, it’s like a big holiday out here!”

Regarding the reconciliation, she said, “We’re working things out… work in progress.”

The superstar just signed a deal for a Las Vegas residency at The Palms, saying, “Everybody is making it such a big deal, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m scared… I always get scared if I haven’t experienced something first.” She added, “I’m excited, it’s a fun, good city, different people every day, and they are gonna come see meeeeeeee.”

Cardi is making her voice heard, taking on social media to give her political views, and recently spoke out about the government shutdown. She explained she didn’t realize it would create such a reaction. “People are saying, ‘All of a sudden she thinks she is so smart.’ This isn’t about being smart, this is something... you can watch the news and you can understand.”

The 26-year-old was invited to speak to at a Democratic Party reception in Iowa during a tour stop in May. “That would really scare me, but I wouldn’t mind. I will talk just how I talk… if I could talk about what’s going on in America with a little entertainment, why not?”

Cardi told AJ, “Do you know that America's reading level is on a 4th-grade level? Politicians... they use these big fancy words, people don’t know what they saying. I’m gonna break it down.”

The “Money” rapper is not interested in running for office. “I think it worked for Trump 'cause he has a lot of money, so I think that’s why it worked out for him, not 'cause he has experience.”

Taking on the border wall, she said, “You all need to understand that your President is ruining your country that you love, but you so blinded by your racist mind, you don’t see.”

On what happened to “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, Cardi said, “It’s crazy, and you want to know something – these are things that happen every single day.”"
