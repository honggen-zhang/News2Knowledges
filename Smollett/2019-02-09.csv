Prat, who has always been public about being a devout Christian, discussed his recent 21-day Daniel Fast, which he did with his church. “Daniel was a guy who only ate fruits, vegetables and grains,” said Pratt of the fast, and continued to discuss the role that church and religion plays in his life.

Pratt attends church at Zoe as well on the church it’s modeled after, Hillsong, both of which are Evangelical denominations that are popular with Hollywood celebrities, including Justin and Hailey Beiber, Kendall Jenner, Selena Gomez and more.

But despite its progressive trappings and Instragram-worthy following, both churches remain steadfastly anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ rights. Hillsong also does not allow queer members to hold leadership positions within the church.

Ellen Page recently called out Pratt for his involvement with the churches on Twitter, writing:

Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too? https://t.co/meg8m69FeF — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 8, 2019

The out actor followed up by writing:

If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed. Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop. Sending love to all — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 9, 2019

If lgbtq+ people are expressing their pain, their trauma, their experiences…maybe just try and listen? Open your heart, stop being defensive and have compassion. It’s a beautiful and life changing feeling, empathy.

Much love truly to all. — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 9, 2019

Page has been a vocal activist for LGBTQ rights, and recently appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where she delivered an impassioned speech calling out Mike Pence and the anti-queer policies of the Trump administration and how those policies cause horrific crimes like Jussie Smollett’s recent attack:

.@EllenPage is fed up with leaders who promote hatred and intolerance. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/apxXzye5SF — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 1, 2019

While these so-called trendy churches may be targeting the youth audience with messages of loving and welcoming everyone, that love is limited to folks who think and believe like them. They are still, shamefully, anti-LGBTQ and anti-women’s rights, and no amount of snapbacks, tattoos or meme-friendly sermons will change that underlying message of hate. If your love and tolerance has limits, then maybe you aren’t as loving and tolerant as you think you are.

RELATED: Jussie Smollett Did Not Want To Report Attack, Police Report Says

The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett just got a lot more complicated as reports are coming in that police plan on filing charges against the star if they believe he is lying about the circumstances surrounding his attack!

The Source reports that Jussie may have filed a false report to the police about the hate crime that happened to him on January 29th.

The investigation is still ongoing, however, due to the fact that the Empire star is refusing to hand his phone over to the police, he will have a hard time proving his case and avoiding jail time as his attackers have done so.

The Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has also taken to social media to announce that if Smollett is found to be lying, he will be charged. Police are still trying to match surveillance footage to new suspects, as the original ones were found to be homeless people with no relation to the attack.

""My initial reaction was sadness,"" Lemon tells the table. ""I wasn't shocked. I didn't like that it happened to him.""

Don Lemon recalled the ""sadness"" he felt when he heard about Jussie Smollet's horrific attack a couple weeks ago.

In preview clips for Monday's upcoming episode of ""Red Table Talk,"" the CNN anchor spoke about calling the ""Empire"" star immediately after he heard about the incident, where Smollett was allegedly beaten up in a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago.

""My initial reaction was sadness,"" Lemon told the table. ""I wasn't shocked. I didn't like that it happened to him. I called him because we have mutual friends.""

""I talked to Jussie for a minute and he said, 'I gotta go, the doctors here' and it just made me sad,"" he continued. ""Everyone talks about, 'Well, this happened and that happened.' My concern is for him.""

Lemon, who like Smollett, is openly gay, also recently spoke out about Kevin Hart's Oscar debacle following the comedian's controversial comments about the LGBTQ community over the years. Although Lemon said on his show last month that Hart's apologies have ""fallen flat,"" he told Jada Pinkett Smith and the table he thinks now it's time to ""move on"" from it all.

""Everyone was like, 'Don Lemon is going after Kevin Hart.' I wasn't going after Kevin Hart,"" Lemon explained. ""I wanted Kevin to understand and to hear from people who look like me. It doesn't mean Kevin has to go around carrying a rainbow flag marching in a parade. That's not his prerogative, he doesn't have to do that.""

""He's apologized,"" he added. ""We should accept it. We can't bully him into doing or being someone he doesn't want to be or whatever and I think we need to move on and let Kevin be Kevin right?""

The 31-year-old actress took to Twitter on Thursday night to call out the Guardians of the Galaxy star for attending, what she calls, an ""infamously anti-LGBTQ"" church.

""Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?” Page, who last month celebrated one year of marriage with wife Emma Portner, tweeted.

The actress' comment comes after Pratt made an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, and opened up about participating in the Daniel Fast, a Bible-inspired diet that is described by the fast’s website as “a vegan diet with additional restrictions,"" which he was informed about through his church.

Pratt attends the celebrity-attended Hillsong Church, and mentioned that he ""was inspired by my pastor, we do it, it’s kind of like our Lent, you know, give something up,"" he told Colbert. The church was founded in Australia and has locations in New York and Los Angeles.

In 2015, the New York branch's leader, Carl Lentz, came under fire for saying that homosexuality is a sin and that a day member could never hold a leadership position. He also released a strongly worded message when news that two gay choir members of the church got married. Pratt has yet to respond to Page's tweet.

Pratt was previously spotted attending the church in August with then-girlfriend Katherine Schwarzenegger. The two have since gotten engaged.

ET spoke with the Lego Movie 2: The Second Part star earlier this week, where he shared why his fiancee is the perfect woman.

Similarly, there may not be a story where you can tell more by what has not happened, in comparison to what actually has occurred.

The current public stance of the Chicago police is that earlier this month, at 2 a.m. on a very cold Chicago night, Smollett was the victim of what appears to be a heinous hate crime where he was physically attacked by two men, and humiliated due to his race, homosexuality, and possibly his opposition to President Donald Trump. The Chicago media, in official reports, has largely treated that narrative as legitimate, while chronicling the complete lack of suspects and corroborating evidence as more of a frustration than any indication that something else might be going on here.

Behind the scenes, however, based on conversations I have had with multiple people covering the story, there is a radically different take on what really did happen to Smollett. In short, there is near unanimity among police sources that Smollett’s story is very likely not true. And that even the media outlets still regurgitating the current “party line” don’t really believe it.

In my experience, most people are very bad at reading the tea leaves in these types of situations, and it often leads to very inaccurate interpretations of what is really going on. This case has several important elements which, if you know what to look for, make evaluating the actions of the police and news media really rather easy.

The first thing you need to understand about this situation is that, because of Smollett’s persona and the nature of his allegation, no one in law enforcement or the news media wants any part of publicly questioning his story. Everyone knows that if they make any sort of negative implication against a black, gay, liberal, celebrity, victim of a horrible hate crime, that they will be roundly and severely attacked, regardless of whether they turn out to be correct.

As a conservative, I look at this as his Political Correctness Force Field. Smollett’s protection here is literally about as strong as it gets, especially in Chicago, a city that has a large black population and is extremely liberal.

So, in this hyper-sensitive media environment, any sort of deviation from the accepted storyline by the police or the news media, much like if your seven-year-old kid is showing subtle signs they no longer believe in Santa Claus, must be given exponentially greater significance than it normally would. Here, both the police and news media in Chicago have provided plenty of those types of veiled indications, both publicly and privately.

Among other things, the police have made it very clear they have not yet found any proof of an attack, despite having almost all of Smollett’s movements on surveillance video. They have disclosed that Smollett would not give over his cell phone to verify his timeline of events. They even published photos of “persons of interest” that they had to know were going to be universally mocked for being obviously irrelevant.

In my view, none of those important revelations would have been made public in the way that they were, unless there was extreme suspicion within the police force that Smollett’s story was not fully accurate.

By extension, media figures would not be being told by their police sources, as I have been told is currently happening both routinely and with vigor, that the authorities are acting on the assumption that they will never find any evidence to fully substantiate Smollett’s story. This isn’t just happening via idle speculation either, the police are doing so with great specificity, even including an alternative theory for what really happened (current attempts to find the origin of the rope found around Smollett’s neck long after the event was over are believed to be the most likely game-changer, if there ever is one in this case).

As for the Chicago media, a couple of local television reporters are apparently using Twitter as a confessional for information about the case that their stations currently fear to air. Rob Elgas of the Chicago ABC affiliate, and Rafer Weigel of the Fox station (which carries Smollett’s show Empire) have continually updated the developments, or lack thereof, in a way that paints a much different picture from the one that viewers would see on an actual newscast.

It is very obvious that if one major news outlet in Chicago had the guts to be the first to openly discredit Smollett’s story, the others would soon follow the leader. But because the risk of being wrong in this situation (see Smollett’s PC Force Field), there is just no incentive to take that dive until and unless the police finally make a definitive statement.

I have written previously about my skepticism about the case, and speculated that this story would quickly disappear because there is no way it would get conclusively solved, and no one in authority will have any appetite for the perils of debunking a story from someone like Smollett. However, Weigel tweeted out some rather candid thoughts yesterday which gave me slight hope that maybe we will actually get to the truth of this matter (though, if that truth is indeed as those closest to the story suspect that it is, the news cycle created by that shocking disclosure will probably be exceedingly short).

Since so many have asked me if @Chicago_Police will let #JussieSmollett case go unsolved, I’ll give my opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the crime, I don’t believe so. I believe they’ll either find the perpetrators responsible or charge #Smollett w/ filing a false report — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 8, 2019

#Chicago is already dealing with a negative image when it comes to crime. Proving #JussieSmollett made up the story would go against that narrative. Conversely, @Chicago_Police bringing any suspects to justice for this horrible crime would bolster the dept’s image. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 8, 2019

Lest We Forget

(Image by Marcello Rollando) Details DMCA



More than Trump and Commonwealth trio, it is their past path pavers and current enablers that have earned our, buyer beware scrutiny: David Sorensen, Roy Moore, Mitch McConnell's Kavanaugh, Devin Nunes, bookends Mike Pence & Steve King, NRA & Paul Erickson, Alexander Acosta and systemic institutions of sexual harassment and racial degradation like, arguably Penn State, USA Gymnastics, and Eastern Virginia Medical School and Gucci seemingly oblivious to recycling shame, betraying innocence and demeaning the humanity of all not Caucasian, Protestant and heterosexual

With the possible exception of the sleaziest of sleaze it should be no surprise that Catch and Kill can be a two-way street; nor that minds acquired in the know find nothing particularly note-worthy of one vainglory peckerwood wading in the swamp of an Access Hollywood pecker-in-chief, whose length in lies belies his explosive fantasies of greatness.

Nonetheless, truly inquiring minds know what happens when willful extortion, blackmail and habitual distortion of truth, hit a potentially wounded, but potent post, rising higher than a DC wall of shame, flexing its creative founding muscle as formidable foe against loud mouth duo complicit in deceit and reputation destruction.

Karma teaches, those who seek salvation in good ol' boys' paleface government and male-dominated Wall Street secrets, will suffer much of the same fate as the less fortunate, they seemingly can't resist abusing.

Is not the answer we're denying: hate, like that which attacked Jussie Smollett, Frank Robinson, Anita Hill, and Valerie Plame lives on just under our national consciousness, ever waiting for a little prick to release its load of anti-American venom poisoning the very ideals found in both Constitution and Bible?

Is President Trump a foreign agent

Is, The South Shall Rise Again, the only real Southern Strategy

Is Media that traded its independent investigative reporting for regurgitating conjecture our Fourth Estate

Is traditional masculinity defined by sexism

Is wearing Blackface a joke or anti-Emancipation Proclamation

Indeed, we are in turbulent waters, navigating challenging waves of self-destruction, but if we can just manage, to rid ourselves of all anchors to a hateful past, all denial of what we've wrought on ourselves and all negatively labeling others for what we cannot abide in ourselves we may just discover enough light within to enlighten our world.

We are more than a tea-stained American Dream, white-washing our Black-Face nightmares and restricting our national ID to ICE, Red, Blue and Purple States, Black v. White and LGBTQ v. straight.

Choosing Stacey Abrams to respond to SOTU was a pragmatic unification gesture. Not just because she is a woman of color, but because she is a woman who stood tall for her right to be treated equally - and proving herself superior to the corruption of opponents, won the national acclaim, audience and admiration of all Americans who like John Dingell, exemplify true patriotism: the courageous honesty to help, the Home of the Brave, find its way home.

I wish we didn't live in a nation where one's political leanings, sexual persuasions or hue of skin aroused any need for discussion. I wish we hadn't diminished that for which we were called to be stewards. I'm sorry our equality and justice was ever determined by physical body parts instead of those whose examples we follow, to whom we bestow the batons of power and whose company we keep in our aloneness.

But when a loved one is assaulted, and our first concern is the skin color of the assailant is she any less raped if the penis is white? It is we ourselves who have failed to recognize, that the power of our demons within withers, when we let go of them.

I wish no humiliating poverty on any human being; no rape for man, woman or nation; and I hope revenge, rage, justice and equality will one day be blind enough to see setting our table for eternal, internal peace."

Ellen Page has lashed out at Chris Pratt for attending an “infamously anti-LGBTQ” church.

The lesbian actress criticised Pratt on Twitter after he spoke on Thursday’s (February 7) episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert about being “inspired” by his pastor to perform the 21-day Bible-derived Daniel fast.

Quote-tweeting a Hollywood Reporter article which noted that Pratt had talked “about his spiritual side,” Page wrote: “Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?”

Pratt has not yet publicly responded to Page’s tweet.

Chris Pratt goes to a church with anti-LGBT links

The Lego Movie 2 star attends Zoe Church, according to The New York Times, which has links with Hillsong Church, a Pentecostal congregation founded in Australia by anti-gay marriage pastor Brian Houston. Hillsong now has locations in more than 20 countries across the world, including the UK and the US.

Hillsong, which according to US news site Vox includes Hailey and Justin Bieber, Kylie and Kendall Jenner and Selena Gomez among its congregants, has faced accusations that it referred queer members to undergo gay ‘conversion’ therapy, as reported by The Daily Beast.

Chris Pratt talks about his church on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert:



The church has since disavowed gay ‘conversion’ therapy programmes, joining dozens of prominent medical organisations around the globe who have condemned the harmful and ineffective practice.

Despite this shift around 2011, Hillsong has still faced criticism over its treatment of queer people.

“I do believe God’s word is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman” — Brian Houston, senior pastor of Hillsong Church

In 2015, Houston, who is still Hillsong’s senior pastor, came out against same-sex marriage and “a gay lifestyle” during a blog post he wrote in response to the news that two of his congregants were gay.

Houston wrote that he holds “to traditional Christian thought on gay lifestyles and gay marriage. I do believe God’s word is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman.”

He added: “Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles.

“Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.”

Before Chris Pratt, Ellen Page lashed out at the Trump administration

Page took a stand against those who support anti-LGBT causes last month as well, coincidentally while appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

The Gaycation star emotionally hit out at the Trump administration for spreading hatred which she linked to the suspected racist and homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett.

Page condemned Vice President Mike Pence’s anti-LGBT views before telling the studio audience to “connect the dots.”

She said: “In terms of what happened the other day to Jussie… this is what happens.”"

""I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone,"" he wrote on his Instagram Story. ""Despite what the Bible says about divorce, my church community was there for me every step of the way, never judging, just gracefully accompanying me on my walk.

""They helped me tremendously offering love and support. It is what I have seen them do for others on countless occasions regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender.""

Pratt also insisted that while he considers himself to be a spiritual person, no single church ""defines"" his belief system.

""My values define who I am,"" he said. ""We need less hate in the world, not more. I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from judgement of their fellow man.""

A source close to him said that the he had returned to the same house he was living in when he was attacked.

Fresh off of throwing a fit over Mike Pence and blaming the Vice President for the Jussie Smollett attack — which police are currently getting suspicious about the truthfulness of — Page has now turned her increasingly frown-lined face toward America’s beloved Chris Pratt.

Pratt was recently on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where he revealed that he recently took part in his church’s “Daniel’s Fast,” and dropped some serious wisdom about being in the spotlight.

“If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that’s within you, it will kill you,” Pratt said.

Page, however, decided that a person having Christian beliefs and attending church is worth attacking someone over, and since Pratt got to share his faith on the same show she had previously thrown a very rehearsed looking and over-acted hissy fit on, she decided to get a little salty on Twitter.

“Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?” tweeted Page.

Page seems to be so caught up in her identity that she’s confusing having Christian faith with hatred for the LGBT community. Either Page hasn’t met too many Christians or has only met sour people who sign onto the Christian faith.

Of course, Page holds that Pratt’s church, Hillsong Church, is “infamously anti-lgbtq,” likely due to the fact that it removed a man from choir leadership when it was revealed that he was having a homosexual relationship with one of the choir members, and intended to marry. The church also has a past of conversion therapy for gays looking to rid themselves of their homosexuality.

But the pastor of Hillsong’s New York Church, Carl Lentz, seems to take a pro-LGBT stance.

“We have a lot of gay men and women in our church and I pray we always do,” Lentz said in 2014.

“Jesus was in the thick of an era where homosexuality, just like it is today, was widely prevalent. And I’m still waiting for someone to show me the quote where Jesus addressed it on the record in front of people. You won’t find it because he never did,” he said.

Whether you agree with Lentz on his stance or not, Christians are often taught not to hate anyone regardless of their sin, as we’re all sinners at the end of the day. Many Christians have friends and family in the LGBT community whom they love dearly.

This quick assumption that Pratt is somehow guilty of anti-LGBT hatred due to his association with a Christian church is absurd, and is a snap judgment on Page’s part, making Page the only bigot here."

To see Black men draped in lilac plumes, white tulle, in pale green dresses with trains following behind them also made me think about acceptance and pride — something many men have too little and too much of, respectively."

Plugging his Lego movie sequel, Pratt appeared on last night’sThe Late Show and made chitchat about his 21-day Bible-inspired Daniel Fast, which he said he did through his church. “I was inspired by my pastor,” he said. He referred to a quote from the church about the pressures of fame and the struggle not to lose sight of his inner self, saying, “If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that’s within you, it will kill you.”





The Hollywood Reporter tweeted about Pratt’s interview and it caught Page’s attention. It’s been reported that Pratt attends megachurch Hillsong — famous members include Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin as well as Selena Gomez — which has been under fire for some time for declaring homosexuality a sin and not allowing openly gay members to have leadership positions, but even more so recently. (See: Queerty’s Chris Pratt attends an anti-gay church with a history of child molestation and ex-gay therapy.) The tweet led Page, one of Hollywood’s most outspoken gay actors, to reply, “Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?”

Pratt hasn’t addressed her tweet — or the other negative stories out there linking him to Hillsong — but Page was applauded for pointing it out. It’s been written about often over the last month.

Pratt has attended Hillsong with fiancée Katherine Schwarzenegger, People magazine has reported. He’s long been associated with Zoe Church in Los Angeles, which is part of the Hillsong Family, promoting his pastor Chad Veach’s book, Faith Forward Future, to his fans in 2017. He told Esquire in 2014 that he found religion as a lost 19-year-old — four weeks after he started attending church, he was discovered in Hollywood.

Pratt and Schwarzenegger, who started dating last year and are expected to marry this year reportedly connected through church. Her mother, Maria Shriver, mentioned during a Facebook interview with Veach that he regularly visits her home to counsel her children. When Pratt and Schwarzenegger announced their engagement, he said he was “proud to live boldly in faith with you.”

Page recently blasted the anti-LGBT rhetoric from Vice President Mike Pence and other politicos in the wake of the alleged hate crime against Jussie Smollett. “Let’s just be clear,” she said on the Late Show. “The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love [I have] with my wife. … He believes in conversion therapy.” She added, “This needs to f***ing stop.”





In an interview with the Guardian last month, Page said she won’t be silenced. “We need to stop claiming the political activists are ‘radical.’ The people who are f***ing radical are the people who want to keep destroying our water and our topsoil and our air in order to give a few people billions more dollars.” She said those are the real extremists. “It’s not a debate, whether Donald Trump is racist or not. Gay marriage is not a debate. And the media needs to stop claiming it is.”

She added, “We just have to try and educate ourselves. And really speak up. I’m learning to worry less about what people think and not to be afraid to say the truth. Which is: ‘What’s happening right now is wrong.’”
