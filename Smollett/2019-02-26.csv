Latest prospects,[],https://cartermatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lethal-Weapon-season-3.jpeg,"['future', 'renewal', 'happen', 'sure', 'shows', 'latest', 'viewers', 'season', 'lethal', 'network', 'weapon', 'theres', 'fox', 'prospects', 'hopes']","





Tonight, Lethal Weapon season 3 will be concluding with an epic episode on Fox, so there is really no better time to talk about the series’ future.

Will a season 4 happen? Could a season 4 happen? The short way to answer that is that it’s all up to Fox … but we want to give a little bit more context than that.

So why should the network renew the show? For starters, it seems as though there’s already a plan. Speaking via Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Matt Miller confirms as much with a message about tonight’s cliffhanger and what that means for the future of the franchise:

The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, less so than in the previous 2 seasons, but it’s definitely a launch to where we want to go in season 4. Since we’ve already mapped out in detail what season 4 looks like, it will definitely be a bummer if we don’t get to tell that story.

It’s hardly a jaw-dropper that Miller is already plotting out the future — good showrunners do that! What happens with many bubble shows is that the creative team comes up with an idea and pitches it to the network — it’s basically them making a bet that they can convince executives to give them another go. Sometimes, it works and a network believes the show will hold its audience. Other times, it doesn’t and everyone’s left upset.

New Lethal Weapon video!

At the bottom of this article, we take a longer look at the future of the series in our most recent video, so be sure to check that out! For more news on the show, subscribe to CarterMatt on YouTube and also view our Lethal Weapon playlist so you don’t miss any upcoming videos.

The state of the ratings

To call the season 4 prospects of Lethal Weapon complicated wouldn’t be doing it justice. This is one of the most polarizing shows on all of network TV, mostly because of the Clayne Crawford firing and the fallout that happened back in the spring of 2018. It’s a weird situation when there are viewers rooting for a show to come back for more and also one where people are rooting for it to burn in a fire; you can’t really recognize one without the other, but it’s also not the job of the Lethal Weapon creative team at this point to focus on the negative. They’ve got a job to do for the people who have stuck by this show and are three seasons deep with it. They have to hope that the viewers who are currently watching the show are enjoying it and want to see it back for a season 4.

So how many people are watching? The bad news is that with a 0.7 rating and about 3.06 million viewers, Lethal Weapon is down more than 25% in both viewers and the 18-49 demographic versus season 2. However, the good news is that five out of the show’s seven most-watched episodes have aired this year … and there have only been five episodes in 2019 so far. Clearly, we’ve seen it pick up quite nicely since the new year started and that bodes well for the future — provided that it can stay out of the headlines since there’s been enough of that to last a life time with this show. This has been a pretty consistent season and there’s a case to be made for doing a season 4, keeping the episode order around 15, and keeping the audience they have with some really great stories.

The case against bringing it back is that Fox’s schedule is currently being cut away with a snap of Thanos’ fingers. (Hey, Disney did just purchase Fox.) They got rid of Thursday nights in the fall for the NFL and then Friday nights starting this fall for the WWE. That’s two nights less of programming a week and that means less of a chance to bring the show back since there’s very little landscape left. This is truly a toss-up and one they may not decide on fully until upfronts in May. It’s got a better chance than Proven Innocent and The Gifted, but it’s on equal footing with The Passage and The Orville at present (the latter’s got a pretty-nice tax credit) and we think that the odds are better for The Resident, 9-1-1, STAR, and even Empire despite the headlines away from the show with Jussie Smollett.

As the truth about what happened became impossible for the media to deny, the message shifted from “this is America under Trump” to “even though this was fake, don’t forget hate crimes are on the rise under Trump.” Keep in mind, when Obama was elected, the media alleged that hate crimes rose because of that, too.

What the media is trying desperately to hide from us is another form of hate crime—those motivated by political prejudice. Jussie Smollett’s hate crime hoax got enormous attention, not just because of Smollett’s celebrity status, but because it fit the narrative: gay black man assaulted by Trump supporters.

Below is a selection of recent examples of anti-Trump hate crimes that the media barely covered. But make no mistake, there are many more examples of anti-Trump /anti-conservative prejudice not covered in this list, such as incidents of vandalism, refusal of service, etc. The important thing to realize here is that these aren’t simply a bunch of isolated incidents. The left has become so consumed with hatred that they will attack anyone who supports Trump, be it children or the elderly, and often without provocation.

14. Pro-Trump student assaulted in Minneapolis

In March 2018, a student carrying a pro-Trump flag was assaulted by “a mob of students” during the National School Walkout in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The attack took place while students at Southwest High School were supposed to be observing a moment of silence to commemorate the 17 students and teachers who died in the Parkland, Fla. shooting last month, WCCO reported. Police said the student was waving a flag in support of President Trump when he was ambushed by at least eight classmates. The mob forcefully took the “Trump” flag from the student and damaged a camera he was carrying. While it was previously reported he sustained minor injuries, a family friend told Fox News he was taken to urgent care because his arm was broken in two places.

A broken arm over politics? Between high school students, for crying out loud! What exactly are kids today being taught?

13. The D.C. restaurant assault

In April 2018, a 29-year-old woman in Washington, D.C., overheard a political conversation between a man and two women and decided to get involved by telling them, “I support Donald Trump.” After this revelation, things got ugly.

“I’m a Trump supporter. I stood by my views, then they called me a racist and then they started attacking me,” Maricela told FOX 5. She claimed the two suspects assaulted her despite their male friend trying to step in to stop them. The victim said she took herself to Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland for treatment of her injuries, the police report said. “After it happened, I got a bruised right eye,” the victim said. “My blood vessels inside my eye burst. I got a fractured finger, a bruised knee and minor bruises all over my body.” D.C. police released video of the suspects captured on the restaurant’s surveillance cameras.

This is why I rarely inject myself into public conversations about politics.

12. The Whataburger assault

Here’s a story we probably only know about because it was captured on video, and the video went viral. Last summer, a 16-year-old wearing a Trump hat was verbally and physically assaulted at a Whataburger in San Antonio, Texas, and had his hat stolen.

San Antonio police detectives nabbed Kino Jimenez, 30, without incident in nearby Universal City, Texas and booked him on a theft of person charge, according to the police department. Bail for Jimenez was set at $5,000, police said. The arrest came after a cell phone video surfaced on Twitter showing 16-year-old Hunter Richard being verbally abused and assaulted for wearing the bright red hat early Wednesday morning inside a San Antonio outlet of the popular Whataburger fast-food chain. The video, which was recorded by a friend of Richard and quickly went viral in online social media, shows a bearded man throwing a drink in the teen victim’s face, and then yelling “you ain’t supporting s—t” as he left the eating establishment with the hat.

CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill seemingly condoned the assault in a series of tweets.

11. Elderly man assaulted at “Build The Wall” rally

It’s not just the young who are attacked for supporting Trump. In June 2018, a 75-year-old Trump supporter named Dan Russell brought a pro-Trump sign to a demonstration at Waterfront Park in San Diego, which was not warmly received.

Video of the event shows Russell presenting his message as anti-Trump protesters walk by yelling and cursing at him. Then 36-year-old San Diego attorney Benjamin Siminou took Russell’s sign and ran away with it. Russell gave chase. Siminou dropped the sign and as Russell reached down for it Siminou pushed him to the ground. When Siminou picked up the sign and continued his flight San Diego deputy sheriffs apprehended and arrested him.

Neither young kids nor the elderly are exempt from being physically assaulted for supporting Trump, apparently.

10. Florida man attacked over Trump yard sign

In July 2018, a man in Boynton Beach, Florida, was attacked for having a Trump flag in his own yard.

A fun night of fireworks was ruined for a Boynton Beach man. Jeff Good says he was attacked for having a President Trump flag in his yard. Good said he was watching fireworks in his driveway when someone drove in front of his house and started yelling at him about President Trump. “He was saying vile things about our president,” said Good. The driver of the car then told Good he had to remove his flag. When Good told him no, he said the driver punched him in the face. Good said he instinctively tried to punch the man back but the man drove off with Good’s arm stuck in the car, and Good was then dragged for about 30 feet.

If you’re willing to drag a man with your car over a political sign, what won’t you do?

9. Punk rocker assaults Trump supporter at concert

In July 2018, Mike Ness, the lead singer of a punk band called Social Distortion, criticized Donald Trump on stage, prompting a Republican concertgoer to respond.

Tim Hildebrand said he suffered two black eyes, a busted lip and concussion at the hands of Ness during a Social Distortion show at Ace of Spades concert hall in Sacramento on July 19, KOVR-TV reported. Ness, 56, had been criticizing Trump on stage, and Hildebrand – a Republican – didn’t like it. “I pretty much said I paid for your music, not your politics,” said the farmer from rural Galt, Calif., about 30 miles away from Sactown. “I stood pretty much with my silent protest with my middle finger up for the next two songs.” Cellphone video of the incident appears to show Ness motioning for the man to come forward – before the singer spit on him. Then Ness puts his guitar down and wades into the crowd and gets into a tussle that’s obscured from the camera’s view.

Perhaps the most disturbing part is that the crowd cheered Ness on.

8. The attempted stabbing of a GOP candidate

Yeah, when a candidate for Congress is threatened and nearly stabbed, that’s pretty newsworthy, but can you remember endless coverage of this story out of California?

A Castro Valley man shouting profanities about President Trump attacked a Republican congressional candidate who was working an election booth at a town festival, threatening him and trying to stab him with a switchblade, authorities and the candidate said Tuesday. Farzad Vincent Fazeli, 35, was jailed after the alleged Sunday attack on Rudy Peters at the Castro Valley Fall Festival. Alameda County prosecutors charged Fazeli on Tuesday with a felony count of making criminal threats and misdemeanor counts of exhibiting a deadly weapon and possessing a switchblade. No one was seriously injured. In an interview, Peters said he had never been concerned about his safety prior to Sunday, though his wife has often warned him to be careful. “It’s a shame,” he said. “People are just polarized right now, and this country’s divided and it’s just a mess. It shouldn’t be that way.”

Fazeli made disparaging remarks about the GOP and screamed “F— Trump, f— Trump!” before walking off, then decided to turn around and approach the booth again.

Peters said the man grabbed a coffee cup from the table and threw it at him, prompting Peters to come around the table and “grab him.” Peters said he threw him to the ground before the suspect hopped back up, reached into his pocket and grabbed the switchblade. “He’s screaming, ‘I’m gonna kill you, motherf—er!’” Peters said. “He had the knife, but the blade wouldn’t shoot out.” A sheriff’s deputy said in a court affidavit that Fazeli threatened to use the pink switchblade on Peters but “could not open it.” Peters said he grabbed a sign from a nearby cupcake booth and braced to use it as a shield. Someone stepped in and urged the attacker to calm down, Peters said, before he left the booth.

This could have turned out very differently had the attacker been able to open his switchblade.

7. Stanford College Republican assaulted

In October 2018, the president of the Stanford College Republicans, John David Rice-Cameron, was assaulted at a pro-Brett Kavanaugh event on campus following his confirmation to the Supreme Court. What makes this story significant (and newsworthy) is that Rice-Cameron is the son of Barack Obama’s former national security adviser Susan Rice.

Across the country, Rice-Cameron was holding court at an event on the Palo Alto campus celebrating Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Signs displayed Tuesday at a so-called Change My Mind event — regular events designed “to promote conservative viewpoints,” as the group’s treasurer told Fox’s Laura Ingraham last week — proclaimed “Kavanaugh is innocent until proven guilty,” according to the Stanford Daily. One student whose mind was not changed was Melinda Hernandez, a sophomore who became involved in a disagreement with the president of the campus GOP. The dispute ended at about 1 p.m. on Tuesday when Rice-Cameron called Stanford police to the central university plaza where, he alleged, Hernandez had assaulted him. Rice-Cameron claimed that Hernandez had shoved him in the chest with her hand, said William Larson, a spokesman for the Stanford University Department of Public Safety. Deputies interviewed both parties, as well as witnesses, and placed the suspect under a “private person arrest” — also known as a citizen’s arrest — and issued her a citation for battery requiring that she appear in court.

Crickets from the national media.

6. Trump supporter hospitalized after assault in Tucson

Trump supporters aren’t safe from political hate crimes at home, or even walking down the street. In November 2018, Jonathan Sparks of Tucson, Arizona, was brutally assaulted from behind for wearing a MAGA hat and carrying a Trump sign.

“I felt a very strong grasp on my hat. It pulled me back and grabbed a lot of hair,” Sparks said. The assailant jumped onto my ankle from behind and so not knowing my ankle was broken into four pieces, I turned around to grab and take the hat back. My hands latched onto the hat.” According to Sparks, they both fell to the ground. “Then I heard the words Hitler, Nazi and Trump. He was shouting things like that,” Sparks said. “He came over the top of me and over and over again, he hit me.” People nearby ran over and pulled the attacker off of Sparks. They held him down until police arrived. Tucson Police Department said the man was arrested for assault. “I was making a statement that I personally believe that Donald Trump is a fantastic president of the United States,” Sparks said. “I think that intolerance to his ideology was the flame.”

Sparks required surgery to repair the injuries he sustained in the attack.

5. The Kentucky Sam’s Club incident

A couple shopping in a Sam’s Club in Kentucky had a gun pointed at them for daring to shop at the store wearing MAGA hats two weeks ago.

A Tennessee man faces a charge of first-degree wanton endangerment after allegedly pulling a gun on a Sam’s Club customer in Kentucky for wearing a Make America Great Again hat. James Phillips, 57, told police he made an obscene gesture with his finger towards Terry Pierce and his wife inside the store because they were wearing MAGA hats, according to a police citation obtained by WKNY. After Pierce returned the gesture, Phillips, who was wearing a veterans hat, “pulled a .40 caliber out and stuck it in my face, backed up and said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die,’” Pierce told 13 News. “I said, ‘Then pull the trigger. Put the gun down and fight me or pull the trigger. Whichever one you want,’” Pierce added. “And he backed up and he said it again, he said, ‘It’s a good day for you to die.’”

Clearly anti-Trump liberals would never defend to the death the right of others to say things they disagree with.

4. Store clerk verbally assaults 14-year-old wearing MAGA hat

Here’s a story that didn’t get the Smollett treatment in the media, but PJ Media covered it: Last week, a 14-year-old boy was verbally assaulted by a store clerk because he was wearing a MAGA hat.

Over the weekend, an employee at a clothing and shoe store in Kansas demanded that a teenage boy take off his MAGA hat, and when the kid didn’t, the employee said “f*ck you,” according to the boy’s mother. “He did nothing to you,” the mother told the employee. “What did you say to my son, to my 14-year-old?” “I’m sure he’s heard it before,” the employee responded sheepishly. “Where’s your manager?” she snapped. “Let’s go.” The woman explained what happened to the employee at the counter: “My son walked into the store — that gentleman first told him, ‘take off your hat.'” She pointed out that the teen did not say a word to the employee. “He said ‘F you’ to my son,” she complained, and repeated her point that her son hadn’t said or done anything wrong.

Once again, adults attacking kids. Very nice.

3. Woman assaults Trump supporter at Mexican restaurant

PJ Media readers are also familiar with this story we covered a few days ago, involving a Massachusetts woman who was “charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct after attacking a man wearing a Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat in a bar.”

Police in Falmouth, Mass., were called to the Casa Vallarta bar at about 8 p.m. Friday after Rosiane Santos, 41, allegedly went on a drunken rampage, verbally assaulting and attacking a man who says he was minding his own business. Bryton Turner said it was due to the MAGA hat he was wearing. Turner recorded the incident with his phone saying, “Ignorant people like this. I’m just trying to sit here, eat a nice meal.” The video shows Santos walking up behind Turner and knocking the hat off his head. “That’s the problem with America these days. People are just ignorant. They want to lash out on people who are educated,” Turner said in the video.

2. The UC Berkeley attack

Another incident in the wake of the Jussie Smollett hoax that should have gotten more attention but didn’t (and still hasn’t) is that of the brutal assault of a conservative activist on the UC Berkeley campus last week. This assault was also captured on video.

A conservative activist was assaulted at UC Berkeley on Tuesday while recruiting for the conservative non-profit organization Turning Point USA. The unprovoked assault, captured on video from two angles, shows a man wearing a black shirt and pants accosting Hayden Williams, a campus representative for Leadership Institute. The assailant angrily shouted obscenities at Williams, knocking his phone out of his hand, and punching him in the face. The man accused Williams of “encouraging violence” just before attacking him.

Because just being a conservative or a Trump supporter triggers violence, of course.

1. The “Build The Wall” dinner assault

A mere two days later we have another anti-MAGA hate crime that has been virtually ignored by the media when an attendee of a “Build The Wall” event organized by the California Tea Party Caucus was assaulted outside the restaurant the event was being held at.

That attendee, John Berry, told the Bee he was inside the restaurant, then went outside to film the protesters. Berry’s video shows one protester knocking Berry’s phone from his hands. “I’m not going to be intimidated by a bunch of little punks,” Berry told the Bee. “We’re 100 members attending a dinner and they were trying to shut us up. The irony is they were so cartoonish it was actually funny. They did us a favor by providing us publicity and a reason to go.” A suspect arrested in connection with the attack received a citation for battery and was released, according to the report. He was identified as Clayton Isaeff.

Robin Roberts: There Were ‘Red Flags’ In The Smollett Case

Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts said that there were “a lot of red flags” in the allegedly fake hate crime Jussie Smollett orchestrated against himself, despite not having brought them up during her interview with him earlier this month.

Roberts made the comment about holes in the “Empire” actor’s story during her interview with Chicago’s superintendent of police Eddie Johnson on Monday morning.

“We worked very closely with their lawyer, and their lawyer went in there to talk to them and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them to just tell the truth about what happened, and that’s what they decided to do,” Johnson stated.

Roberts answered, “Even though that you all were saying early on there was no reason not the believe his story, there were a lot of red flags, that a lot of people saw of people saw. You all had questions. Even though weren’t, of course, going to be public about that.”

“Right, there with questions, but there’s always questions when people are describing incidents to us. We have to maintain the integrity of the investigation and that’s what we did,” the superintendent of police followed up.

Many described her interview with Smollett as “too soft.” She also never used the word “alleged” to describe the hate crime, according to NewsBusters. Both ABC and Roberts defended the interview, saying that, at the time of the interview, police considered him to be “credible.”

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told Chicago police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a noose-like rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Smollett also alleged that the men screamed “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

In two recent whydunits, the curious have wondered why: (1) a successful TV star would allegedly orchestrate a fake, hate-inspired attack on himself, and (2) a Coast Guard officer would allegedly plot a mass-murder attack on American Democrats and journalists.

In the first instance, prosecutors say that actor Jussie Smollett last month paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack, tie a noose around his neck, douse him with bleach and shout, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor, who is gay, and his alleged pretend-assailants, are all black. But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired — by Smollett.

If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged with disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a Ronald Reagan phrase commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed — at least by many in the pitchfork media — because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

A more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay — and in the name of Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Mass., for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, last week, a California high school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

On a far more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested last week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people — and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion — it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, but the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated three-decade military servicemember, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court but never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grownups are so upset about it.

Green Book won Best Picture at the Oscars. With only two days left in the month, things were looking bleak until Solange Knowles, first of her name, protector of sisters, and guardian of Black hair, swooped in to save the day with a BlackPlanet account.

Solange took to Twitter today with a simple directive: ""find me on BlackPlanet!!!"" She then included a link to blackplanet.com/solange which features never before seen pictures and videos; A pole dancer in clear heels, Solange in a clear top, and a Black man atop a horse are among the artistic offerings. There are little quotes embedded onto the page that I pray are song lyrics. ""For the bad weaves and two days"" and ""Threw my earnings like offerings and prayed it made her feel good"" are already bops as far as I'm concerned. Fans are hoping that this is part of a rollout for Solange's long-awaited follow up to A Seat At the Table. Her account also includes a tab with a list of festival dates where she's performing, starting in May.

A flood of new, creative Solange content is already enough goodness to turn our BHM luck around. But the messenger, in this case the platform that she chose to use, is just as important. BlackPlanet.com launched in 2001 as a social networking site that specifically targeted African-Americans. Before Twitter and Instagram, and even before MySpace, there was BlackPlanet. My friends spent hours coding their pages to include music, pictures, and other personalized elements. It was here where they dared DM the person they had a crush on in the hallways; It was today's Tinder and Facebook for a generation of Black millennials. It was started by Omar Wasow and is now owned by Radio One, a media conglomerate that also targets African-Americans and is owned by Cathy Hughes.

If this is Solange's new, permanent internet home, she just made a huge case for buying Black and diversifying tech at the same damn time. She's the hero we both want and need. BlackPlanet's servers better be ready for the influx of new accounts."

While the media may consider the term ”fake news” to be a slur these days, Project 21 member Jerome Danner warned that “the line between a writer’s perspective and a journalist’s report of what actually happened in a story continues to be blurred.”

In a commentary published by the Western Free Press, Jerome noted that the constitutional right to a free press comes with an expectation that those basking in that freedom will show a respectful measure of objectivity and civility. “[L]ike with any freedom,” he wrote, “the possibility for abusing it is always easy.”

Members of the press may not like the term “fake news,” but recent media misfires such as the apparent Jussie Smollett beating hoax and wild allegations that President Donald Trump is a Russian agent indicate that the profession needs some introspection. Jerome noted that “what cannot be denied is the fact that too many times news is repeated over and over again before it is thoroughly analyzed.”

Jerome added:

The words “fake news” may bother people. Nevertheless, it should agitate them all the more that reports that need corrections (and later receive corrections) are often viral before corrections can even be taken into consideration by an audience.

Limiting the law-abiding citizen

Re: “Limiting the carnage,” Feb. 21 letter to the editor

The problem with the effort to limit assault-style rifle magazines to 10 rounds is that criminals don’t abide by the laws. That’s why they are called criminals.

I used to hunt wild fowl and knew of several hunters in the field who did not put a plug in their shotguns. I don’t consider them “criminals,” but they were breaking the law.

Now, put a law-abiding citizen in a defensive mode against a criminal who has no regard for the 10-round limit in an assault-style rifle. How does he fare defending his home, car, family, animals or homestead?

There are many illegal items around that criminals seem able to find at will. It is almost impossible to enforce the 10-round limit because so many gun owners already have 20- and 30-round magazines. What should law enforcement do? Spend time serving search warrants to law-abiding citizens who have not turned in all rifle magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, instead of going after the few who are doing bad things with a few magazines. Besides that, you can tape two magazines together and get 20 rounds for a fast reload.

May it go well with you.

Will they ever learn?

It’s shocking just how quickly many in the media so vocally pounced on Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by President Trump's supporters. Oops, big mistake!

Guess they were once again unwilling to hear the facts. Anti-Trump anything is red meat for these bloodthirsty types.

After watching clips of major media outlets’ initial coverage of the attack, not one that I saw called the attack “alleged.” How many times have they rushed to judgment in the very same way? Too many!

Will they apologize and will it prevent them from this behavior next time? (Probably not.)

Thank you, kind strangers

On Feb. 23, my friend and I were having dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in Palm Desert after attending Mass.

We were seated at our favorite table and we noticed a family sitting close by. As we were discussing the day’s events, our waiter came to our table and told us that the nice people who sat next to us paid for our cocktails after they left.

We just wanted to thank the family for such a nice gesture to senior citizens and hope something nice will happen to them.

Cardi B says she’s “really disappointed in Jussie Smollett” because she feels like “he f**ked up Black History month.”

On January 29th, Smollett, who stars on the hit Fox show Empire, told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two masked men who beat him, poured a chemical substance on him, placed a rope around his neck, and shouted at him: “This is MAGA country!” The Chicago Police Department investigated the alleged attack as a “possible hate crime” because Smollett told them that the men screamed racial and homophobic slurs at him.

But in mid-February, which just so happens to be Black History Month, Smollett’s story began to unravel as the Chicago PD released more details about the alleged attack. The two men in the alleged assault were apparently friends of Jussie, police said, and they were paid by the actor to stage a hate crime so that Smollett could get a pay raise on Empire.

Cardi B does this thing where she says what everyone is thinking, but doesn’t want to say it out loud, and, if Jussie Smollett really did lie to us about being attacked, Cardi pretty much nailed it right on the head with this one.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett,” she said on Instagram Live last Monday (Feb. 18). “I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro.”

Cardi, however, is still holding on to hope that Jussie is somehow telling the truth and he’s simply being framed as a liar by Chicago police.

“Like, damn. I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the sh*t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to they said police in Chicago are racists,” she said. “So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you f**ked up, for real.”

“Like, why would you do that?” the Grammy Award winner asked. “Then you give f**king Donald Trump immunity to laugh at n***as and sh*t, to make motherf**kas look bad. This sh*t crazy, girl.”

Jussie Smollett, for his part, has maintained his initial story and even referred to himself as the “Gay Tupac” when he addressed a crowd at a concert following the incident.

He was arrested on Thursday (Feb. 21) and spent a few hours in Cook County Jail before paying $10,000 bond on a $100K bail to be released.

After leaving jail, he went straight to the Chicago set of Empire where he was met with a group of angry cast and crew members who later told producers that they didn’t want him a part of the show anymore.

Fox announced last week that Smollett’s character had been written out of the final two episodes of the current season, and there are reports that he could possibly be replaced by a new actor next season. Empire is currently in its fifth season, which comes back from hiatus on Wednesday, March 13th."

That is serious and unacceptable. This reality transcends the Jussie Smollett case, and the real culprits are not people making false allegations but people perpetrating very real crimes — most of them unsolved — on a routine basis.

On January 29, ”Empire” series television actor Jussie Smollett claimed to have been the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime near downtown Chicago. According to the actor and advocate, his assailants punched him, threw a rope around his neck, doused him with a liquid thought to be bleach, shouted racist and homophobic epithets, and declared “this is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country,” alluding to the term used by Trump and his supporters. Several weeks later, after an extensive investigation, the Chicago Police Department arrested Smollett for allegedly filing a bogus police report and staging the attack himself for publicity and a possible boost to his salary. Smollett, who maintains his innocence, now faces felony charges and has become the subject of late night television jokes. Social media has also been awash with tweets and posts deriding Smollett.

This case is deeply disturbing and admittedly confusing on many levels. Even as many of the specifics in this case are called into question, lawyers and reporters caution us to wait for all the facts to come out, and to presume Smollett’s innocence until they do. Like most people, with limited information, I am both skeptical and saddened by all the narratives and counter-narratives we have heard thus far. Any fraudulent claim of racial and/or homophobic violence is dangerous and hurtful because it undermines the believability of the many legitimate claims that might come in its wake. I am not sure if Smollett is telling the truth about this particular incident or not.

What I am sure of is that this kind of attack, in Trump’s America, could indeed have happened in the way Smollett describes it. Maybe it did not happen to the Empire star, but similar events happen to dozens of people around the country on a daily basis and get much less attention. That is why so many activists, celebrities, presidential hopefuls and news pundits so readily believed Smollett at the outset. The focus of our alarm should be the current reality that made his story believable in the first place.

We live in a country where the person holding the highest office in the land is an unapologetic racist and hatemonger. He began his public career crusading against the legitimacy of the nation’s first African American president with the so-called “birther” movement. Since then he has accused Mexican immigrants of being murderers and rapists. He has also called countries populated by Black and Brown people, “shithole countries.” And he has described violent neo-Nazis as very “fine people.” Moreover, Trump himself has encouraged his MAGA-hat wearing followers to use violence against his opponents.

Acts of violence classified as “hate crimes” have increased steadily in the U.S. over the past three years. Every single day, nearly 20 such acts of violence occur in this country, including racist, homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, ableist and anti-Semitic attacks. People are punched, shoved, kicked, spat upon, taunted, beaten and murdered. Black queer and transgender folks are some of the most frequent targets of such attacks. If and when they survive, many recount stories of being further victimized by the police, who mock, doubt, harass and even assault them.

Given a political atmosphere in which the denigration of marginalized communities has become commonplace, it is not hard to believe that a high-profile Black gay man who has spoken out openly in support of progressive causes would be the target of violence. Shouldn’t that reality be the foremost object of our outrage?

Such attacks are occurring with disturbing frequency and with a tacit nod from some in positions of prominence and power. That is the real cause for outrage and alarm.

Moreover, none of our sources of information in this case inspire full confidence. Granted, pieces of Smollett’s story don’t quite add up. But we have a Chicago Police Department that has been guilty of torture, forced confessions and cover-ups. And we have an FBI notorious for campaigns of character assassination, surveillance and set-ups of Black activists from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Black Panther Party. So, we don’t have a clear, credible and coherent story yet in the Jussie Smollett case. But we do have a bigger picture to frame what we do know, and our larger understandings of these types of violence.

Acts of racist and homophobic violence may often seem hard to believe until all the facts around them are revealed. For example, could we have fathomed a young white man, barely 21, walking into a Black church in Charleston, and with venomous racial hatred in his heart, shooting in cold blood nine unarmed Black parishioners ranging in age from 26 to 87, while they sat together in prayer? Who could have predicted a shooter murdering 49 strangers in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016? How could we have anticipated the horrific and inexplicably gruesome torture and murder of a young gay man, Matthew Shepard, over 20 years ago in Laramie, Wyoming? There is an element of disbelief when we hear of these kinds of horrific crimes because many of us (especially those in communities that are rarely the targets) don’t want to believe that we live in a country where this kind of attack can occur. And yet we do.

Such attacks are occurring with disturbing frequency and with a tacit nod from some in positions of prominence and power. That is the real cause for outrage and alarm.

Police in Jackson, Mich., arrested Nikki Joly and charged him with arson for the 2017 blaze, which killed five of his pets — two German Shepherds and three cats.

The arrest came as a surprise to many locals, as previously, the case was being investigated as a hate crime, reports The Detroit News.

Joly, 54, had been named 2018 Citizen of the Year by MLive.com for his many efforts of LGBTQ activism, including helping to found a community center, starting a Pride festival, and fighting to pass a local nondiscrimination ordinance protecting gay people in employment and housing.

An investigative report from Jackson police suggested that a wish to draw attention to LGBTQ issues is a possible motive for the crime.

Barbara Shelton and Bobby James — who work at the St. Johns United Church of Christ, which houses the Jackson Pride Center — told authorities Joly was upset that Jackson Pride, held in the week before the blaze, hadn’t attracted enough attention and he feared public interest in LGBTQ rights was waning after the passage of the nondiscrimination ordinance.

Shelton disputed this account in a response to The Detroit News. Shelton “never heard Nikki comment in any fashion about anything like that,"" she said.

Daniel Barnett, Joly’s representation, dismissed the motive as well. “It doesn’t make sense,” he said. “He was citizen of the year. There was plenty of media coverage already before the fire.”

Evidence compiled by Jackson police show that Joly would have had the means and opportunity to commit the crime. According to the investigative report, Joly purchased $10 worth of gasoline the morning of the fire, which he told authorities was for his lawn mower. The blaze was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m. — only a few minutes after Joly had left the house. Traces of gasoline were also discovered on the clothes he wore that day.

News of Joly’s arrest comes in the wake of the investigation of Jussie Smollett, who is also accused of faking a hate crime. The headlines have plastered many right-wing media sites in what appears to be an effort to discredit victims. Ann Coulter has said outright that all hate crimes are fake. In reality, attacks against LGBTQ people and other minority groups have reached record highs, according to the FBI.

However, activists point out that even one fake allegation can give powerful ammunition to enemies of the LGBTQ community. “All that good work is tainted. We know one bad mark outshines a hundred good ones,” Stella Shananaquet told The Detroit News in response to Joly’s arrest. “I’m infuriated someone could tear down the community that way.”"

Groups including Protect Our Wildlife and the Vermont Coyote Coexistence Coalition have been regularly advocating for Vermont to follow the lead of Massachusetts and set a formal season on the killing of coyotes.

Their multi-year campaigns added a new supporter after a scene that played out Saturday morning in the backyard of Diana Hansen of Craftsbury.

""It was, particularly for me, extremely traumatic,"" Hansen told necn Tuesday.

Hansen said a hunter set his dogs on a coyote, and they chased the animal into Hansen's backyard — biting and bloodying the coyote as her young children watched from a rear window, horrified.

""It was incredibly disturbing to see that kind of violence happening,"" Hansen said.

The mom said the coyote pursuit also caused around $500 in damage to the family's greenhouse when the dogs and their target climbed on the greenhouse, puncturing its plastic with their claws.

It is legal to hunt coyotes with hounds year-round in Vermont, but animal advocacy groups often criticize the practice.

""The use of hounds in hunting is really concerning,"" said Barry Londeree of the Humane Society of the United States.

The Humane Society, along with Protect Our Wildlife and the Vermont Coyote Coexistence Coalition, wants to see tighter regulations in the state, including a specific hunting season for coyotes.

Londeree said the animals have an important role in the ecosystem, including preying on rodents like mice and rats.

""They shouldn't be subject to year-round hunting with no limits,"" Londeree said of coyotes.

For a response to the advocacy groups' calls for a defined hunting season on coyotes, with limits, necn sought an interview with the Vermont Department of Fish & Wildlife.

However, the department's commissioner, Louis Porter, declined to comment — even in general terms — citing an ongoing Vermont State Police investigation into this weekend's case in Craftsbury.

Mike Covey, the executive director of the Vermont Traditions Coalition, said the coalition opposes changes to the coyote hunt or any restrictions that would alter the way houndsmen enjoy the outdoors.

""There are social aspects of it, in terms of it's family time,"" Covey said of hunting with hounds. ""A lot of these folks take their kids out with them. It's something they grew up doing with their parents; it's something their children are growing up doing with them. They have a very strong connection to the dogs.""

Covey noted that he feels houndsmen have been vilified in social media discussions on coyote hunting regulations, saying he sees them as a group that cares about the landscape of Vermont.

Covey also said the coyote population is healthy and abundant in Vermont, arguing that restrictions on hunting are not needed at this time.

""If there's no biological imperative to shorten the season, then we shouldn't be doing it,"" Covey said.

As for Hansen, she said she has researched how to register her private land formally as not being a place to hunt, and plans to push for a local town ordinance that could address hound hunting.

Hansen told necn she hopes to spare a neighbor the kind of animal bloodshed and damage that came into her quiet backyard this weekend.

""It's kind of frightening,"" Hansen said. ""Something has to be regulated.""

Londeree was at the Vermont State House Tuesday advocating for a bill that would crack down on what he termed wanton and wasteful hunting — such as the leaving of dead animals to rot in the woods or the killing of animals without a purpose, like harvesting meat to feed people."

The 2017 fire killed five pets, the Detroit News reports. Nikki Joly, a transgender man, had received death threats prior to the fire, and investigators determined that the cause of the blaze was arson. More than a year later, Joly was arrested, but police haven't put forth a motive and his lawyer says, ""It doesn’t make sense."" The house was a rental, and was insured by its owner. A police report said two people who worked with Joly at the Jackson Pride Center said Joly, 54, had been upset that the issue of gay rights was receiving less attention, but one of them says her statement was misinterpreted and she didn't hear Joly say such a thing. And Joly's lawyer adds, ""There was plenty of media coverage already [for gay rights activism] before the fire."" A hearing is scheduled for March 8.

""It’s embarrassing,"" one gay rights activist in Jackson says. ""How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?"" Joly had just achieved a series of local victories for gay rights residents, per the News: He'd organized the city's first gay festival, opened its first gay community center, and helped win an anti-discrimination ordinance—which had been rejected for 18 years running. The Jackson newspaper named him Citizen of the Year. Joly's case has drawn comparisons to that of actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of a hate crime hoax in Chicago. ""Real hate crimes are on the rise,"" an academic at Oakland University tells the Detroit Free Press. ""But as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.""

Kelly's additional charges. If so, might I suggest taking a look at Lil Pump instead? And no, I'm not talking about the disorderly conduct charges that were brought up against him and then dropped after body cam footage of his arrest was released to the public. I'm talking about recent claims by his record label that Pump will deliver the commencement address at Harvard University's 2019 graduation ceremony.

Like many other entertainment journalists and critics, I was minding my own business Monday morning, when I got an email from Warner Bros. Records explaining that Lil Pump—the face-tattooed, colorfully-dreaded Soundcloud rapper—was about to enter a new level of prestige. If the email was to believed, the artist famous for 2017's viral hit ""Gucci Gang"" and last year's ""I Like It"" with Kanye West, was about to join the ranks of Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg by delivering the commencement address at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. But if 31 years of living—and following Joanne Prada on Twitter—has taught me anything: it's how to spot a possible scam. I thought getting to the bottom of it would be pretty cut and dry, but now I have just as many questions as when I started out.

Most outlets that covered the news when it broke seem to be on the same page about the fact that, despite Pump's upcoming album being called Harverd Dropout, he is definitely not giving the speech. This makes sense. At only 18 years old, he is just barely at an appropriate age to even enroll in Harvard, let alone drop out of it. The first thing I did when I got the email was check the Harvard University website. It had previously announced keynote Angela Merkel listed as the only speech deliverer at this year's event. I then reached out to both Harvard and their official radio station, which supposedly confirmed the news.

Someone from Harvard responded, oddly enough, with a request for the original press release that I had received. This was the first piece of damning evidence that this was all a PR stunt. If Harvard had approved Pump to address its graduates, surely the school's media rep would have been prepared to offer an explanation to the public. I followed up, asking if Pump would be involved in Harvard's commencement day activities in any capacity and only received the following line: ""As previously announced, Angela Merkel will be Harvard's Commencement 2019 speaker,"" plus a link to the Harvard Gazette article announcing her address. I took this information back to the Warner Bros. rep that initially reached out to me (feeling just as accomplished as I used to back in 2001, after pulling off a successful three-way call sabotage with my best friend) hoping to finally get the real tea. I fully expected to get a playful response that explained the whole thing away in good fun. Instead, I got ghosted.

Call me paranoid, but I think there's a possibility that this isn't a normal PR stunt to promote an album. Why didn't Harvard offer a firm denial about Pump's involvement as opposed to just reminding me who the official speaker is? Are SoundCloud rappers beneath them, or is it possible that they are secretly planning on incorporating him in some other way? If this is just a way to get everyone's attention, is it even legal for Pump's team to send out that kind of false information? Why was Harvard's radio station—whom I also never heard back from—specifically named as breaking the news? Why has the Warner Bros. team refused to acknowledge my email?

John Legend isn't ready to let a bad apple spoil the bunch.

The ""All of Me"" singer was in New York City on Tuesday when he was asked if Jussie Smollett's alleged hoax sullied the claims of other victim's of hate crimes.

""Hate crimes happen all the time in America,"" Legend said, ""and it’s still a terrible thing. And even if one person’s [story] wasn’t true, it doesn’t make all the other people who make claims false.""

It was a busy day for Legend speaking out on behalf of victims.

John Legend was one of the few musicians who spoke out against R. Kelly in the ""Surviving R. Kelly"" documentary and Legend appeared on ""Today"" where he was asked about the disgraced singer being charged and his role in what transpired.

""I’m so glad that the documentary was made.,"" Legend said. ""I’m so glad that the victims got to have their voices heard, and I think them having their voices heard, this story being retold — because it’s been told before — but I think being retold through that medium really brought the issue to a lot of people’s attention, and I think it inspired the law enforcement to move on some things that they weren’t moving on before.

“I’m p***ed off,” Brady explains when referencing Smollett, who now holds a felony disorderly conduct charge for filing a false police report, which claimed the actor was attacked in an alleged hate crime.

The “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” star adds, “What do you say to your mom? What do you say to your family on the day you have to turn yourself in? How dare you. So I’m hoping that we’re wrong. I’m hoping that there’s some amazing evidence. But, if not, I’m deeply ashamed of him and for him.”

Addressing Hart’s past comments, Brady says, “I know Kevin and I’ve had the opportunity to work with him and he is a wonderful guy. But, that being said, no matter what a good guy you are, everyone has room to grow.”

Jussie Smollett Out For The Rest Of This ‘Empire’ Season : NPR

Just a day after Jussie Smollett found himself formally in legal jeopardy, arrested in Chicago for filing a false police report, the Empire actor’s job appears to be in jeopardy as well. Executive producers of the Fox program announced Friday that his character, Jamal, would not appear in the final episodes of the current season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” said a statement signed by Lee Daniels, Danny Strong and five other producers.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show,” they continued, “and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Permit me to translate: Most of the rest of the cast have said they won’t work with the despicable little fucker.

But FOX is pussyfooting, of course. Poor Jussie hasn’t been “fired.” They care so much and so deeply about him, you see. (If you know anything at all about the business, you’d be laughing your ass off at that).

He merely won’t “appear” for the rest of the season. (While the assholes running the show hope no more shit blows up in their faces. Unfortunately for them, it will – when the federal charges come rolling down).

After which Poor Jussie won’t “appear” on any further TV entertainment shows, anywhere, ever, although he may spend some time being observed by the CCT monitoring his cell."

Production sources who worked with Jussie Smollett on the “Empire” have said they don’t believe he staged a fake hate crime to get leverage for a bigger per-episode salary — and that he never indicated he was unhappy with his earnings.

Sources told TMZ that Smollet, who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series, earns a generous $125,000 per episode, the same as his on-screen brother. For comparison, the show’s co-leads — Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard — reportedly make $250,000 per episode.

The production sources told TMZ that no one in a decision-making position regarding Smollett’s salary had heard that he was interested in negotiating for a higher rate, adding that he was in the middle of a long-term contract.

In a press conference last week, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accused Smollett of orchestrating a fraudulent hate crime to “promote his career,” indicating that Smollett wasn’t happy with his salary.

According to the TMZ report, Smollett was more concerned about his solo music career, and was frustrated that his first album didn’t sell well. As CrimeOnline previously reported, Smollett was preparing to film a music video in late February. The two brothers who have been questioned for their possible involvement in the alleged hate attack are heavily involved in physical fitness, and Smollett had written in the memo on a check made out to one of the brothers that the $3,500 amount was for a nutrition and fitness program. Authorities reportedly believe the check was payment for the brothers’ role in the hoax hate crime.

In an appearance on Good Morning America, Johnson said the information about the payments came straight from the two brothers who testified before a grand jury.

“They [the brothers] said that he paid them $3,500 with a check … to carry out this incident,” Johnson said, adding, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, that does not support the version he gave.”

Smollett was arrested last week and charged with disorderly conduct on suspicion that he filed a false police report. The actor is currently free on bail an due back in court on March 14.

Kamala Harris came to Iowa last month shortly after entering the presidential race, she surprised some in her own party by breezily stating her support for a single-payer health care plan that would end private insurance.

“Let’s eliminate all of that,” Harris, D-Calif., said during a prime-time town hall event on CNN. “Let’s move on.”

Her comments caused an immediate stir in the political world — and Republicans saw a chance to link her to a more extreme policy proposal than she perhaps intended. So when she returned to the state on Saturday, she had a much more precise answer ready when asked about universal health care.

“In my vision of ‘Medicare for all,’ there would be a phasing in of it, and there would still be the option to have private insurance for the purposes of supplemental coverage,” she told a voter in suburban Des Moines whose question had actually been about how best to finance a single-payer system.

Few other Democratic presidential hopefuls have enjoyed as splashy a start as Harris has: She drew 20,000 people to her formal campaign launch in Oakland, California; raised $1.5 million in her first full day in the race; and has been talked about on social media more than any of her rivals, vaulting to the top tier of the rapidly growing field.

But the candidate is still catching up to the campaign — and not just on health care policy.

On issues ranging from breaking up big technology companies to the crisis in Venezuela to reparations for African-Americans — and even the allegations against actor Jussie Smollett — Harris has not offered positions when asked, had to clarify her views and softened her previous comments.

It is hardly unusual for candidates to stumble or appear ill at ease at the outset of the grueling political crucible that is a presidential campaign; even former President Barack Obama, who is remembered as a political phenom, struggled at times in the early weeks of the 2008 campaign.

But the scrutiny has grown even more intense since that race, and the margin for error is minuscule in a field with so many candidates.

With the growth of political news outlets, the rise of social media, and the global interest surrounding President Donald Trump and his re-election, high-profile candidates do not have the luxury of honing their stump speeches before a few dozen voters, and even fewer reporters, in a cozy Concord living room.

Instead, there have been hundreds of attendees at many of the early gatherings featuring the best-known candidates — as well as dozens of writers and photographers eager to capture every moment.

“There is no on-ramp today,” said Stephanie Cutter, a top aide in John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. “It’s instantaneous, which means it is harder for the candidates to work out their positions or decide their positions.”

In this environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Harris’ first response on private health care echoed as loudly as it did. It was not just because of the implications for the nearly 60 percent of Americans who receive employer-based insurance — it was also because she made her remarks on live national television.

Past campaigns did not feature made-for-cable-TV town halls more than a year before the first primary.

Yet health care is not the only issue Harris, who was elected in 2016 to represent California in the Senate, has handled with uncertainty since she entered the race.

Asked Saturday morning about the growing tensions in Venezuela, and specifically how to get aid into the country and whether America should consider using force there, she offered a brief answer with few particulars.

“We need to take it very seriously,” Harris told reporters. “But I don’t know that at this point we need to, and I would not condone, military action at this point.”

Later that afternoon, though, she offered a more detailed response on Twitter about what she called “a crisis” stemming from President Nicolás Maduro’s rule.

“As President, I would immediately extend TPS status to Venezuelans,” she said, referring to temporary protected status for migrants. “It’s the right thing to do. America must show moral leadership in this hemisphere.”

On reparations, Harris said, “Yes, I am,” in a radio interview this month when she was asked if she was in favor of what her interviewer called “some type of reparations” for black Americans affected by slavery.

But when asked in another interview last week to be more specific, she highlighted her tax proposal for middle-class families, a more universal approach that is inconsistent with the definition of reparations.

“I’m not going to sit here and say I’m going to do something that’s only going to benefit black people,” Harris told theGrio, a news website focused on African-American issues.

In other instances, she appears uneasy committing to a policy at all, perhaps sensing a political hazard.

On Saturday, for example, an Iowan asked Harris if she would favor eliminating the filibuster if Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, to more easily push through the party’s agenda. The urgent necessity of doing so has become an article of faith to many on the left.

She initially joked that she wanted to change the subject, twice allowed that she was “conflicted” and did not offer a direct answer. “Sorry I can’t give you more than that right now,” she told the voter.

Similarly, when a reporter asked Harris last month on her first campaign trip to South Carolina about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s suggestion that technology giants like Amazon should be subject to antitrust laws, the California senator sidestepped the issue, which is a delicate matter in her state. “I don’t know enough about what she’s proposing, but I’m happy to follow up with you,” Harris said twice.

At a voter forum in Des Moines on Saturday, Harris said she did not want to be pegged in any fixed ideological category — a posture that can frustrate some progressive Democrats.

“That was evasive,” said Ed Fallon, a liberal Iowa activist who attended the forum. “It’s clear that she wasn’t being clear.”

Her how-will-it-play hesitation is also frustrating to some more pragmatic Democrats who believe the candidates should not try to meet some imagined standard of ideological orthodoxy.

“They’re playing too assiduously to the critics of Twitter,” said Paul Begala, the longtime Democratic strategist. “And the truth is that doesn’t matter.”

Begala said party activists were overwhelmingly fixated on defeating Trump and were unlikely to penalize a candidate if they think he or she is up to that job.

“The scrutiny is far more harsh this time, but the voters are much more forgiving if they think you can win,” he said.

Yet her response to the Smollett case may only reinforce her instinct for caution.

Immediately after the actor, a gay African-American, said he had been attacked in Chicago by a pair of Trump supporters in what he described as a hate crime, Harris wrote on Twitter that the incident represented “an attempted modern day lynching.”

But after the Chicago police last week accused Smollett of staging the attack and charged him with filing a false police report, Harris was caught flat-footed. Reminded by a reporter that she had called the case a “modern day lynching,” she appeared to look back toward her aides before offering a halting answer.

“I think the facts are still unfolding,” she said. “I’m very concerned about obviously the initial allegation that he made about what might have happened.”

The good news for Harris and all the Democratic candidates, Cutter said, is that “it’s OK not to have a position today” on some issues.

“Voters just need to know you’re thinking about issues and are intellectually curious,” she said.

That kind of leeway, she said, will disappear in just over three months, when candidates gather for the first Democratic debate.

“When they have to stand onstage next to each other and debate each other, platitudes aren’t going to win the day,” Cutter said."

Five pets died in the inferno.

Cops say Nikki Joly — who lives in Jackson, Mich. — had organized a number of pro-LGBTQ events.

But when the 2017 Jackson Pride Parade and Festival failed to generate the amount of publicity Joly wanted — good or bad — he became angry.

Two days before the fire he posted on Facebook: “Yes, be angry, be very angry. Use that anger to force good! Use that anger to make change.”

The fire at his home was initially investigated as a hate crime by the FBI and residents of the city opened their hearts and wallets to help.

Now, a new police report said the fire and its aftermath were a hoax to generate publicity for gay and trans causes.

“It’s embarrassing. How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?” Travis Trombley, who is gay, told The Detroit News.

Joly was at the forefront of a wide array of anti-discrimination legislation and was once named Citizen of the Year, the media outlet reports.

But investigators are painting a different picture.

Det. Aaron Grove told Metro News that Joly was “very deceptive” and possessed “layers of manipulation.”

Even in the investigation’s embryonic stage, cops were suspicious of Joly. His clothes smelled of gas and he admitted to buying $10 of fuel at a local service station.

He claimed it was so he could cut his grass. But his timeline of the day of the fire would have left a would-be arsonist just five minutes to set the house aflame.

Joly married his girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire destroyed his home

Two German Shepherds and three cats perished in the fire.

The activist has denied setting the fire. He’s charged with one count of first-degree arson and two counts of animal cruelty.

Joly’s woes come on the heels of Empire star Jussie Smollett’s trials and tribulations.

Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report for allegedly staging a bogus racist, homophobic beatdown in Chicago."

Another tweet from a few months prior, which was not directed at anyone, read, ""YOU'RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE."" That tweet has also been deleted.

The statements were of particular interest because when the brothers were first brought in for questioning, they were quick to release a statement saying, ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Sources in close to the case tell The Blast they believe the deleting of the tweets could be seen as intentional destruction of evidence and ""there could be severe ramifications.""

We're told the tweets could now be a pivotal part of the case.

Both of the Usondairo brothers have said the ""Empire"" star paid them $3,500 to help stage the attack, but Jussie Smollett is adamant the money paid was for a training session.

""The problem is there aren't that many hate crimes occurring in the country,"" Carlson said, in response to the latest news about ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. ""So, instead, reporters take their numbers wholesale from partisan activists who pose as researchers or from wholly fraudulent organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups use moral panics to gin up fund-raising. They get rich doing it. So, of course, they continue.""

The Southern Poverty Law Center, in actually, is a non-profit that tracks hate groups across the U.S. and reports their activities to the public, law enforcement agencies and the media. The SPLC released a report last week that reveals the number of hate groups across the country surged to 1,020 in 2018 – a 20-year high – and that extremists today include white supremacists, black nationalists and neo-confederates. Additionally, the latest FBI statistics from 2017 show that hate crimes increased by 30 percent across the country. (The FBI has not released figures for 2018.)

Carlson, however, did not mention those numbers on his primetime show.

""It's just not a very hateful place. So they have to make them up,"" Carlson said. ""How do they do that? They do it – and this is key – by counting accusations as crimes. An accusation is not the same thing as a crime – it's not even close.""

The Fox News host alleged the press issued the following message surrounding Smollett's allegations: ""Shut up, and believe it – or else you're a bad person, if not clinically insane.""

Smollett received international media attention last week after he claimed he was brutalized in a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago. As an investigation into the actor's allegations unfolded, Smollett was arrested Thursday morning by Chicago police for allegedly filing a false police report. Law enforcement officers later claimed that an alleged attack against Smollett was actually a ""publicity stunt"" devised by the actor over a desire for a better salary. Smollett, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence.

The actor's case, according to Carlson, reveals that ""the few people who are willing to think for themselves turned out to be absolutely right, and the press is scrambling to explain how exactly did that happen. How could reporters who are literally paid to be skeptical have fallen for such an obvious lie?”

""This is the new official story, the one you are going to be hearing for a long time, the one your kids will be learning about in school,"" Carlson continued. ""And it's this: A specific hate crime may not have happened in this case, but hate crimes overall are incredibly common. And the incidence of them is rising.""

""The problem with what you just heard is it's a crock. It's totally false,"" the Fox News host added. ""In fact, it's probably untrue. Anyone who says otherwise — like the people you just heard — is either intentionally misleading you or doesn't understand the numbers — and that would include most journalists. Type in the phrase 'hate crimes' into Google, and you will see story after story claiming that thousands of these atrocities take place every year in our country — and the incidence of them is rising.""

The latest involves liberal actor Jussie Smollett who is accused of staging a racist and anti-gay attack on himself, which Smollett blamed on supporters of President Donald Trump. Smollett’s alleged fake “hate crime” appears to be the latest instance of people manufacturing hate crimes for attention in the Trump era.

One of the more recent hoaxes involved the Covington Catholic School students, some of whom were wearing MAGA hats, who were said to be disrupting and harassing a Native American man banging a drum. Subsequent videos showed the story, as perpetuated by the national media, celebrities, and leftists everywhere, to be false.

Some of these students were even the recipients of death threats. Attorneys for the student receiving the most vitriol have filed a $250 million lawsuit against the Washington Post for defamation. Other lawsuits against those who perpetuated the hoax are said to be pending.

What all of these hoaxes have in common, other than their being lies, is the attention given to them by the media and the rapidity of liberals jumping on the bandwagon far before the true facts were revealed. Not only have politicians, actors, and newscasters been guilty, millions of people flooded social media with their sense of horror and outrage that such crimes had occurred. Except, they hadn’t.

In the Kavanaugh hearings, several women alleged that the nominee for the Supreme Court had assaulted women, apparently on a regular basis, in his younger years. Without waiting for any facts, save accusations, Kavanaugh was pummeled from all directions in an attempt to either ruin his chances of being confirmed or to pressure him into withdrawing from contention. Since then, nearly all of these allegations have been “walked back,” as they say.

In Denton, Texas, resident David Williams set his own car on fire and painted “n***** lovers” on his home’s garage, in an apparent attempt to stage a hate crime. Local police investigated the arson as a hate crime. Williams and his wife, Jenny, collected more than $5,000 from Good Samaritans via a GoFundMe page before the hoax was exposed.

An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed in November 2016 that two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

And the list goes on. One of the things I learned while serving as a law enforcement chaplain for 25 years is that people lie. They lie all the time. Even the most honest people can get caught in a lie. Sometimes people lie to protect feelings. What man has not heard the question, “Does this make me look fat?” Only the most foolhardy will tell the truth if, indeed, it does make her look fat.

Not all lies involve hate crimes, of course. I recently learned of a person who was hired by a major Southern university for a faculty position. There were many applicants but this person had the best resume. Except that it wasn’t. It was faked. The offer was withdrawn.

As noted earlier, part of the problem is that people lie, they lie for a variety of reasons, and they lie because they have an agenda. The other part of the problem is that people also want to believe that people are generally honest and that they tell the truth. So, an accusation, however flimsy or untruthful, tends to be believed by sympathetic people.

But when the lie fits a preconceived narrative, then people lose their perspective, abandon the “innocent until proven guilty” premise, and jump on the accused with both feet. Later, when the hoax is exposed, some even persist in their delusion by saying, “Well, even if this one was false, it’s still true somewhere.”

No, a lie is a lie. People have been hurt by these accusations and reputations ruined. The media has always seemed to love stories like these.

Of course this stuff has always happened to some extent. Back in 1987, 15-year-old Tawana Brawley accused four white men of a vicious rape. The case gained national attention especially because the four men included police officers and a prosecuting attorney. Bill Cosby offered a $25,000 reward for information on the case (seems ironic, huh?) and Louis Farrakhan led a protest march.

When civil rights activist Al Sharpton, with attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason , began handling Brawley’s publicity, the case quickly became highly controversial. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason generated a national media sensation. The three said that officials all the way up to the state government were trying to cover up defendants in the case because they were white. They further asserted that the Ku Klux Klan, the Irish Republican Army and the Mafia were collaborating with the U.S. government in the alleged cover-up.

A grand jury was convened. Brawley never testified despite a subpoena ordering her to do so. On June 6, 1988, Tawana’s mother Glenda Brawley was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $250 for contempt of court for refusing to testify at the grand jury hearing. She evaded arrest by hiding in churches, with the police failing to arrest her, arguing it would lead to violence. The Brawley family then fled New York state, traveling around the country for several months before settling in Virginia Beach.

Much of the grand jury evidence pointed to a possible motive for Brawley’s falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, later shooting and killing her.

There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a shoplifting charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. So one can understand why she might lie.

The grand jury, which heard 180 witnesses and viewed 250 exhibits, including a rape kit, found no evidence that the alleged assault ever occurred. Afterwards lawsuits were filed against Brawley’s advisors for defamation. Yet there are still people who insist that the incident occurred. Why? It fits their narrative.

There is enough real crime in this nation without people making stuff up. But as long as people jump to conclusions, as long as the media reports accusations without facts, as long as we want to believe the worst about people, we will continue to see these lies presented as reality.

I used to think that, in our country, we were better than this. Apparently, I was wrong.

Rosaine Santos, 41, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and assault and battery after assaulting Bryton Turner, 23, at a restaurant in Falmouth, Massachusetts.

Footage recorded by Turner showed Santos clearly knocking the hat off of his head. Witnesses said she also hit him while being escorted out of the restaurant by police officers.

Santos pleaded not guilty and was released pending trial but she was detained on Tuesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after agents discovered that she’s an illegal alien.

“Deportation officers with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Team arrested Rosie Santos, an unlawfully present citizen of Brazil,” ICE said in a statement sent to Boston 25 News. “Santos is facing local charges for assault and other offenses. She is presently in ICE custody and has been entered into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts.”

Santos, a native of Brazil, told police officers at the restaurant that she thought Turner shouldn’t be allowed to eat in peace while wearing the “MAGA” hat, which is worn by some supporters of President Donald Trump.

Turner said after the initial arrest that it was sad to see what happened.

“I think it’s sad that people don’t know how to behave in public. Just because I don’t agree with people doesn’t mean I’m going to be going around assaulting people,” Turner told MassLive.

Smollett Told Black Brothers to Yell ‘MAGA:’ Prosecutors

Actor Jussie Smollett told the Osundairo brothers that he paid to fake a hate crime attack against him to yell “This is MAGA country,” according to Chicago prosecutors.

Smollett, 36, was arrested on Feb. 21 for a charge of filing a false police report.

The “Empire” actor initially claimed that two white men on Jan. 29 assaulted him in downtown Chicago in freezing temperatures, shouting slurs in addition to the “MAGA” line, in an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again slogan.”

While “MAGA” is known as shorthand for the slogan, it’s rarely said aloud in place of the full slogan, making the quote appear awkward. With Chicago being heavily liberal along with most other American cities, it was one of the aspects of the alleged attack that first ignited people’s doubts.

After Smollett appeared in court and had his bond set at $100,000, prosecutors released a four-page summary of his alleged actions. According to the summary, it was Smollett’s idea for Ola Osundairo, one of the Nigerian-American brothers, to yell “This is MAGA country” while placing a rope around his neck.

Smollett also instructed the brothers to yell slurs at him and that Abel Osundairo, the other brother, should “attack him, but not hurt him too badly.”

Smollett gave the brothers extra money to buy the rope, ski masks, gasoline, gloves, and red baseball caps. The latter resembled the red hats that say “Make America Great Again,” which are worn by Trump and supporters of the president.

Smollett is also believed to be behind a letter that was sent to the actor at the “Empire” studios in Chicago and contained the word “MAGA” in addition to threats. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service are investigating whether the actor was involved with sending the letter, which contained a white powdery substance that was later determined to be aspirin.

Police said that Smollett was motivated to stage the attack because he wanted a higher salary.

.@JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019

Smollett, like many in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, has been a big critic of Trump, recently calling Trump “and all his white cohorts” a “national disgrace.”

“And if you support them … so are you,” he wrote in one Twitter post. “Clowns.” He shared a video that showed far-left lawmaker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaking.

After the attack was revealed by officials to allegedly be a hoax, Trump took to Twitter to slam Smollett for including the quote in allegedly staging the attack.

He wrote, “Jussie Smollett—what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?”"

You get two sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins to spoil you, teach you things (both good and bad) and give you a sense of belonging. I, as well, have two sides of family: the Davises and the Waltons—two very different distinctive Southern families that have created the quietly loud, outgoing, ambitious, extrovert whose words you are currently reading.

But I also have two other families—two distinctive cultural families, as well. I am a member in good standing of both the African American community and the LGBTQ community (the “G,” to be specific). Sometimes, these two cultural families break bread at the family reunion in the summer, and sometimes they are as close as the Montagues and Capulets. I am equally parts of both families.

I embrace the rich heritage of the African American experience. I even went to school to further study it in its awesome depths. Being a black man in America is like running a continuously recreated obstacle course in which every time it seems you are about to win the ground shifts, and you just do a little bit better than you did last time no matter how hard you try. To be a black man in America, it can sometimes become easy to believe that your life does not matter when the message you hear daily from the media, White House and other places of authority say that it does not.

Fighting for ‘Acceptance and Validation’

I am also an out-and-proud gay man with all the rights of privileges that it has allowed me in some spaces. According to some studies, this makes me “less threatening as a black man.” Let’s get one thing very clear: In the words of Tupac Shakur, “I ain’t a killer, but don’t push me.” It’s been told to me that being black and gay is like having two strikes against you. As I wrote previously in my column, “You have to fight for acceptance and validation. You have to prepare for the inevitable moment where you might get an odd stare from your own tribe sometimes, which cuts a little harder as a group within an already oppressed minority.” This is even more so when you are part of a minority within a minority.

The African American community is often labelled as being hardline against the LGBTQ community, which is untrue; it is no more against the LGBTQ community than any other community and, if you really want to get right down to it, there are many African, Indian, Native American and Asian-Pacific traditions which were openly welcoming of LGBTQ peoples before white Christian colonialism came ashore from beyond the horizon. There are evangelical Christian segments of the community that believe you can “pray away the gay” and think it is acceptable to disown LGBTQ children.

There are segments that believe that being LGBTQ is something that was placed into the black community by white popular culture and the feminization of black men. Which begs the question to those who believe this: Can we say “Black Lives Matter” if only certain black lives matter? When a transwoman is murdered, when a young boy is put into a trash can by his father, do those black lives matter?

The Jussie Smollett situation, as convoluted as it has become, has highlighted a problem and focused attention on the violence that the LGBTQ community still faces even in 2019. Here we are, 50 years after the Stonewall Uprising, and this type of violence is still real. As the 2020 U.S. presidential election looms ever closer, you can rest assured that these kinds of attacks on racial, cultural, religious and ethnic minorities are only going to increase with the Grand Wizard in Chief at the helm fighting to maintain power.

Both sides of the family need to pull together and prepare for this onslaught together. Like fingers on a hand, we are in this together, and if we combine, we make a mighty fist with which to fight back."

The Daily Caller reports that Roberts made the “red flags” comments to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson during his own interview Monday on GMA, but did not explain why, if she knew that authorities doubted Smollett’s story at the time of Smollett’s interview, she didn’t ask him any tough questions.

Johnson spoke about the interviews he and detectives did with two brothers, who allegedly helped Smollett carry out the hoax, noting that the brothers, after speaking with their lawyer, were very willing to tell “the truth” to investigators.

Roberts responded by asking Johnson whether he’d been clued into some of the “red flags” others now say they saw in Smollett’s story.

“Even though that you all were saying early on there was no reason not the believe his story, there were a lot of red flags, that a lot of people saw. You all had questions. Even though you weren’t, of course, going to be public about that,” Roberts said.

Johnson responded that, indeed, the Chicago Police Department played a number of cards very close to their chest.

But if Roberts suspected Smollett might not be telling the full story, she never let on during her interview with the “Empire” actor on GMA. In fact, Roberts does not appear to have used the word “allegedly” to describe the attack, and several times during the interview allowed Smollett to make off-the-cuff political statements, implying that the city of Chicago was simply teeming with racists, and that those investigating his claims were racist as well.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” Smollett told Roberts. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett even repeated some of the allegations, that he gave to police, that caused detectives and local Chicago media to question his version of events from the beginning — that Chicago’s downtown could be the location of a racist attack clearly motivated by President Donald Trump.

“I could only go off their words,” Smollett said. “I mean, who says, ‘f***** ‘Empire’ n*****, this is MAGA country,’ ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Smollett is now out on bail pending trial, after pleading not guilty to charges that he filed a false police report with the Chicago Police Department. An FBI and United States Postal Service investigation, of the same series of events, is reportedly ongoing."

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was highly steamed about the alleged hoax Jussie Smollett pulled on the city and its cops.

“Those are resources and time spent that we can never get back and we can utilize for another investigation,” Johnson said.

Police haven’t yet totalled up how much money and manpower was dedicated to the Smollett investigation, but Johnson claimed other victims were not shortchanged.

“We have been working on this investigation for about three weeks. We solved several shootings and homicides in that period of time, so we don’t take away resources from violent crimes of that nature just because this person is a celebrity,” added Johnson.

However, police sources tell CBS 2 the resources expended were significant. Twenty-four detectives were removed from regular cases, expending up to 1,000 hours, overtime not included. Police outlined the extraordinary detail of their investigation.

“We interviewed over 100 individuals in a canvass of the area and a followup canvass as our investigation expanded,” said Commander Edward Wodnicki from the Area Central Detective Unit.

In addition, police spent dozens of hours of examining surveillance video from 55 city pod cams and private cameras. And working with federal authorities, they executed 50 search warrants and subpoenas for phone, social media and financial records.

The Fraternal Order of Police is hoping Smollett is ordered to pay back the cost.

“If he is convicted, that the city of Chicago provides him with a bill for all the services that have been rendered from that police department,” said FOP president Kevin Graham."

Commentary

The exposure of Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime hoax left a lot of people with egg on their faces. In the aftermath of the scandal, some of those who condemned the “attack” scurried for cover, while others expressed their disappointment with the actor’s actions.

For some, Smollett’s alleged hoax caused all the more damage because it distracted people from whom they believe are the real race problem in the United States today: President Donald Trump and his supporters.

We’re all familiar with the theory: Trump is a racist. His election emboldened all of the closeted, white racists whose bigotry is constantly smoldering just below the surface of their apparently polite behavior. “Dog whistles” are being employed to send secret racist messages to a lot of white Americans, but most dangerously to old white males like me. According to the theory, one of the ways this process manifests itself is an increase in hate crimes.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) reacted to the first reports of the attack on Smollett as an “attempted modern-day lynching.” After the truth came out, she wrote: “Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett and I’m sad, frustrated and disappointed.” Well said. But, then she wrote this: “At the same time, we must speak the truth: hate crimes are on the rise in America. Just last year, the FBI released statistics that revealed a 17 percent increase of hate crimes in America.”

As a person who works with data, alarm bells begin to go off in my head when a public figure casually tosses out an alarming statistic like that, without any context or further detail. So, I jumped on the FBI website and started breaking down the numbers.

Hate-Crimes Data

The FBI keeps a lot of detailed statistics on hate crimes. For the most part, they act as compiler and validator, rather than as a primary source of these statistics. Other law enforcement agencies send the FBI data, the FBI checks the data, and, assuming it meets their criteria, enters it into their database.

One could, if one had the time, do a detailed analysis of the data year by year. It wouldn’t surprise me to learn someone had done so. My more modest analysis focused on two years: 2011 and 2017.

I chose 2011 because it was in the middle of the Obama era, was not an election year, and could thus be expected to reflect the mood of the nation during a time when progressives were happy with the way the government was running, while those on the right weren’t. I choose 2017 because it’s the latest year available and it’s also the first year of the Trump administration, with a lot of unhappy people on the left and much more satisfaction among conservatives and libertarians.

A first look at the stats suggests Harris might be onto something. The FBI reported 6,222 single-bias incidents in 2011 and 7,175 in 2017. That’s an increase of a little over 15 percent. But, that comparison is a little deceptive because not all local law enforcement organizations (LEOs) choose to report hate crimes to the FBI. The agency indicates the populace covered by participating local LEOs in 2011 was about 286 million, while it was 306 million in 2017.

We really need to “normalize” the data so we can make a fair comparison. So, I generated the hate crime rate per million people for each year. The 2011 incident rate was 21.8 per million, and the 2017 rate was 23.4 per million. That’s an increase of about 7.5 percent. Better than 15 percent, but still an increase. So, the next question is obvious: Why an increase at all?

A Growing Anger

The most significant increases in hate-crime incident rates between 2011 and 2017 occurred in one ethnic group and two religious groups. With one exception, they aren’t groups most people would guess. What the FBI identifies as anti-white hate crimes rose 37 percent, anti-Jewish hate crimes rose almost 14 percent, and anti-Islamic hate crimes rose over 60 percent.

The overall anti-black incident rate was still much higher than the anti-white incident rate—6.6 per million compared to 2.4 per million, respectively—but the rate of anti-black incidents dropped over those six years by almost 10 percent. Similarly, although the rate of anti-Jewish hate crimes increased far less than anti-Islamic hate crimes, the overall rate of anti-Jewish hate crimes remains substantially larger than anti-Muslim hate crimes: 3.1 per million compared to 0.9 per million. Anti-gay (male) and anti-lesbian incidents dropped by 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively.

Now, two years of data does not a study make and I’m not suggesting it should. But this snapshot should at least give Harris and like-minded Americans pause, for it does not suggest rising anger and violence in our nation inspired by nefarious Trumpian dog-whistles directed at minorities and the LGBT community. It rather points to growing anger directed at whites, Jews and—to a lesser, but still important, extent—Muslims.

As with all violence, that directed at Muslims, simply because of their choice of religion, is reprehensible, but I think most of us understand (but do not excuse) its origins. The reason for the growing amount of anger and violence aimed at whites and Jews? I will leave that for the reader to decide.

Glover spoke to about 50 people in the Joyce Hergenhan Auditorium as part of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications’ Leaders in Communication Lecture Series. She graduated from Newhouse and the College of Arts and Sciences in 1996 with a dual degree in photojournalism and African American studies. She is now a social media editor for NBC Owned Television Stations.

Glover said that social media can make journalists lazy, but getting to a story first should not jeopardize the accuracy of the reporting.

“You’re the gatekeeper of trust,” she said.

Glover said that journalists should not share their opinion on hot button issues, as it could infringe on the impartiality of their work. She implored the room to check facts, look for other angles and cover the whole story.

She cited recent media coverage of the investigation of Jussie Smollett, an “Empire” actor who was charged for allegedly filing a false report of a hate crime, CBS News reported. Glover said too many facts and nonfacts are being circulated by media sources that want to get the scoop first.

Fast journalism can also overlook the importance of individual word choice, Glover said. She said she saw a headline during the Freddie Gray protests, which began after 25-year-old Gray died from injuries sustained while in police custody, The Guardian reported. The headline read: “Woman Beats Boy.”

Using “boy” to describe a young black male has historical implications connected to Jim Crow laws, lynching and slavery, Glover said. She said that she worked with the Associated Press to update their style guide to include an explanation of the problems with using “boy” to describe black males of any age. That update was added to the 2018 AP Stylebook.

Glover also spoke about the importance of diverse newsrooms during her talk. She said diverse newsrooms lead fairer and more balanced reporting, which in turn creates a better media product.

When asked about how to increase diversity in newsrooms, Glover said that imbalances in newsroom diversity result from conscious decisions, not unconscious bias. Hiring decisions are orchestrated and purposeful, she said.

Glover also gave professional advice to students during her talk. She said that students should find people that can help them navigate the media industry.

When Glover asked how many people in the room had a mentor, nearly every hand shot up, but when she asked how many people had a sponsor, only a few people raised their hands. Glover said that mentors provide advice, while sponsors take action. Students need both in order to be successful, she said.

“You need your own board of directors,” she said."

Nikki Joly, 54, was named by the Jackson City Patriot last year as the conservative town’s top citizen after organizing its first gay community center and gay pride festival. He also helped pass an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against homosexuals in employment, housing and public facilities after nearly two decades of failed attempts, the Detroit News reports.

Joly was later charged with first-degree arson after authorities determined the blaze was intentionally set — and that the timeline of events made it difficult for anyone but him to have ignited the fire that killed his two German shepherds and three cats, according to a police report obtained by the newspaper.

Two people who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ told police that he had been frustrated that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival didn’t attract more protests or generate more attention for gay rights.

One of the church officials, Bobby James, declined to comment when reached by a reporter, while Barbara Shelton stopped short of that assessment, saying police may have mischaracterized what she told investigators.

“Not sure I said that,” Shelton wrote the newspaper in an email. “I have no idea about anything, never heard Nikki comment in any fashion about anything like that.”

Joly’s attorney, meanwhile, has dismissed the charges, saying his client had no need to generate more attention for his activism, especially since Joly has said he’s received death threats in the past because of it.

“It doesn’t make sense,” attorney Daniel Barnett told the newspaper. “He was citizen of the year. There was plenty of media coverage already before the fire.”

Traces of gasoline were found in five rooms inside Joly’s two-story, wood-frame home, which he shared with his partner, Chris Moore, according to the police report. Two days later, Joly urged supporters on Facebook not to respond to the fire with threats of additional violence.

“Yes, be angry, be very angry,” Joly wrote. “Use that anger to force good! Use that anger to make change.”

During an interview two weeks later with police and two FBI agents investigating the fire as a possible hate crime, Joly dropped his head at one point during a four-hour session. But he did not deny or admit setting the fire, although traces of gasoline were also found on the clothing he wore on the day of the fire, according to the report.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Jackson’s director of police and fire services, Elmer Hitt, told the Detroit Free Press. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

A hearing to file motions in the case is scheduled for March 8, according to the Detroit News.

The case has drawn comparisons to the case of actor Jussie Smollett, who has been charged with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist attack in Chicago. Still, some of Joly’s supporters said they will never believe he set the blaze.

“There’s no path for me to believe it could ever be true,” said Elody Samuelson, a bisexual woman who raised money for Joly after the blaze. “There’s no way he did it — not a bit, not a chance.”"

The superintended made sure to say that filing a false report, which is what the actor is believed to have done, was “dangerous,” as the progress Chicago and the police department has made in race relations lately might be affected.

Johnson also pointed out that real victims of hate crimes should not be treated with skepticism and set clear that it was not the Chicago Police Department saying that Smollett staged the attack, but the evidence they have found so far. The Chicago Police Department also called out Donald Trump.

Smollett's version of the attack

The “Empire” star has maintained the same version of his story ever since the attack happened on January 29. He stated that he was on his way home from a Subway when two masked men insulted him for his race (he is black) and sexual orientation. According to his initial description, at least one of them was white and was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat. The one President Donald Trump usually wore during his presidential campaign.

Will the MAGA slogan be successful?

After the alleged beating, Smollett stated that the attackers put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on his face. As they were leaving, one of them supposedly yelled: “this is MAGA country.”

What the police have revealed so far

Even though the Chicago police initially believed in Smollett’s story and treated him as a hate-crime victim, they identified some inconsistencies during the investigation.

Days after the actor filed the report, Abel and Ola Osundairo were arrested. The men confessed that Smollett hired them to attack him and even disclosed the payment: $3,500 in check form. The actor admitted that he had indeed paid them $3,500, but said that it was related to personal training and nutrition services.

The threat letter Smollett allegedly got

It is not the first hate crime issue in which the actor has been involved. Days before the supposedly staged attack, the Smollett reportedly sent himself a hate letter to the “Empire” set in which he claimed he would be killed. The FBI is investigating that incident, and if they find that Smollett committed mail fraud, he could be behind bars for up to a decade."

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

The post on Saturday came a day after “Empire” producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set.”

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police said Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some “Empire” cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard’s post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.”"

But, on Tuesday, Feb. 26, reports began to surface that contradict this notion.

According to TMZ, Smollett never gave the Empire executives or producers the impression he was unhappy with his pay. Sources explain that if Smollett was disgruntled about his salary, then he kept those feelings to himself. And although his rumored salary of $125,000 per episode is significantly less than household names Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard, it mirrors that of Bryshere Y. Gray who plays Hakeem.

This combined with the fact Smollett was in the middle of a long-term contract with the series casts doubts on money being the motive. The confusion surrounding the case has reportedly disrupted the set's chemistry. It is said that many have doubted Smollett since the beginning and are wondering why he would do it. This includes Terrence Howard.

Despite publicly supporting Smollett, TMZ reported that Howard and Smollett got into an argument regarding the attack. After being annoyed with the story, Howard came to a head when Abel and Ola Osundairo were detained by police. He reportedly confronted Smollett demanding he tells the truth. Also, Howard was not in attendance on Thursday, Feb. 21, when Smollett addressed the cast."

He was going to claim to be sexually harassed/hate-crimed at work and, when asked by whom, he planned to respond, “By anyone who will settle.”

He went on to say, “You notice it is never the middle-income Waffle House manager who gets accused of sexual misconduct; it is always rich folk. I want a piece of that action.”

He’s onto something. An increasing number of claims are made with financial or political motivation (those against Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, for example). The problem is, when so many false claims are made, the important and real crimes are diminished. Ask the Chicago kids killed while 25 detectives were otherwise occupied with the Jussie Smollett case, hunting down those white nationalists who gave him noogies and called him names.

In the case of the hoax “hate crime” Empire star Jussie Smollett tried to pull off, he had both of the aforementioned motivations. Money: he wanted a higher salary than $125,000 per episode from Fox. And he could play the victim, the most coveted role for Democrats and Hollywood. The bonus? His lies would make him a hero to the left and would hurt Donald Trump.

What we learned in this foreseeable farce (I predicted it in a column when it was first reported and got a lot of pushback) is that the media and their left-wing brethren will believe anything you say if it aligns with their political world view. Also, actors like Jussie Smollett make awful film directors.

From the start, the Smollett story seemed like BS to me. At 2 a.m., two white guys recognize Jussie in a Subway sandwich shop. They happen to have MAGA caps on in Chicago’s hip section of town in ten below zero weather. And they happen to be carrying bleach and the noose that all Trump supporters carry with them, as you know.

Then these two guys decide to even some score with a guy they don’t know. It was fishy from the start. In Chicago, not that much planning goes into anything. Chicagoans do not put nooses over necks, call names and declare their political beliefs (“This is MAGA Country”—even though Chicago votes 95 percent Democratic). In Chicago, they handle beefs like men, with drive-by shootings that go unsolved.

So, in Chicago, Smollett filed a false police report and two Nigerian brothers were initially arrested for beating him up. Now they both could be charged with impersonating police officers.

The new PC norm in America is that if you are a woman or minority and you claim to be the victim of a crime — even though there is scant or no evidence — you must be believed. If someone does not believe you, that person hates women and/or is racist. Anyone who doubted Christine Blasey-Ford was guilty of misogyny when he or she asked for evidence.

The left knows they can do this now because once someone is accused and the media do not like you (i.e., you’re a Republican), they have successfully ruined your reputation. Rush Limbaugh calls the media the “drive-by media,” because, like the gangs in Chicago, they shoot ya quick and run away with no responsibility.

The predictable martyrdom that followed Jussie Smollett’s charges is why he did it. The most recent examples of media firestorms are the Brett Kavanaugh hearings on sexual misconduct allegations, the Covington Catholic High School students smeared over falsehoods, and now the Smollett “hate crime” hoax. All are based on well-known and predictable outcomes for those who make this stuff up, and all are based in the presupposition that the U.S. is fundamentally bigoted.

According to the Washington Post, “The 36-year old ‘Empire’ actor filed a false police report when he claimed he was attacked last month in downtown Chicago by two men who shouted slurs and physically assaulted him. The incident captured national attention.”

As I write this article for Matters of Faith, Smollett’s case is still pending as many within the nation try and figure out if he really is a victim of a hate crime, or if he is just the “boy crying wolf” in order to draw attention to himself. If he is truly a victim of a crime, we need to rally around him and all victims of hate crimes in order to ensure their safety and protection; however, if Smollett is doing nothing but crying “wolf,” he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law so that he and others will know and believe that they cannot falsely accuse others of crimes, receive national attention and walk away scot-free.

I believe that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson nailed this fall-out from Smollett right on the head when he said, “Bogus police reports [like this] cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators, as well as the citizens of the city.”

In the same vein, tone and concern as Johnson, Reverend Gregory Seal Livingston, pastor of Chicago’s New Hope Baptist Church, stated, “What [Smollett] did could make it harder for the straight, gay, black, white, rich, poor folks here in Chicago and in the nation. How much more cautious are police going to be to extend credibility and resources to a real hate crime?”

Although the verdict regarding Smollett’s guilt or innocence is not in at this time, many around the nation can already see the “writing on the wall” or the consequence of what happens when people like Smollett falsely draw attention to themselves: They make it just a little more difficult for true victims of hate crimes to actually receive attention or to be believed, and that’s the real crime! As in Aesop’s fable, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” there is the risk that villagers will not believe the “boy” or the “shepherd” and therefore, when a real wolf does appear, it will be written off as a false alarm.

We know that with each new false report, it becomes easier for us to “bury our heads in the sand” a little deeper by pretending that hatred, racism, prejudice or bigotry are not as prevalent as they once were during the slavery movement or during the time of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Therefore, we can somehow put these issues on the back burner of our nation and continue moving forward, right?

I recently read an article called, “Sorry haters — A handful of hoaxes doesn’t debunk the hate-crime reality,” by Goldie Taylor and Katie Zavadski. They state, “While skeptics fixate on a handful of false reports, the number of real hate crimes has been rising across the United States. New York City has seen a 31 percent rise in hate crimes so far this year compared to the same period last year, with the number directed at Muslims going up by more than 100 percent. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported 867 incidents targeting African Americans, Muslims, immigrants, women and the LGBT community. Online harassment was not included in the tally.”

I’m confident that the hate crimes that we have within our nation are not only affecting the adults who belong to different races, color or creeds; these hate crimes are also trickling down to the children in our schools. While doing some research, I stumbled across an excellent 40-page report for principals, teachers and parents called, “Responding to hate and bias at school — a guide for administrators, counselors and teachers.” As pastors, parents and teachers, we might not have time to read a 40-page report about hatred or bullying in schools, but we do need to do our best to ensure that “bullying” gets addressed several times throughout the year in order to protect the children and in order to teach them to respect others.

We may never fully understand what Smollett was thinking when he filed that police report, but we cannot afford to let his case cloud our desire to reach out and help others who are considered to be victims of hate crimes, and where does this outreach begin? It begins in the home; it begins with you and me.

“Let there be peace, and let it begin with you and me!”

But the candidate is still catching up to the campaign — and not just on health care policy.

On issues ranging from breaking up big technology companies to the crisis in Venezuela to reparations for African-Americans — and even the allegations against the actor Jussie Smollett — Ms. Harris has not offered positions when asked, had to clarify her views and softened her previous comments.

It is hardly unusual for candidates to stumble or appear ill at ease at the outset of the grueling political crucible that is a presidential campaign; even former President Barack Obama, who is remembered as a political phenom, struggled at times in the early weeks of the 2008 campaign.

The Chicago Mayoral election is today. Soon the city of Chicago will have a new mayor after a likely runoff election. For the Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, a new mayor likely means a new superintendent since a new mayor will likely want to start over with their choice to lead the Chicago Police Department (CPD).

Luckily for Superintendent Johnson, the Chicago Police Department is in the national spotlight because of the Jussie Smollett case. So Superintendent Eddie Johnson is in the perfect position to boost his resume and put himself in the national spotlight. He started preparing himself for the national stage by delivering a dramatic speech about Smollett’s alleged wrongdoing in front of the national press by saying how offended he were as an African American that Smollett chose to use a noose in his fake attack.

Now Superintendent Johnson is using the Smollett case to make the rounds on several national news broadcasts like he is auditioning for his next job as a news correspondent, elected official, superintendent of a new city or willing author looking for a book deal.

Superintendent Johnson talked about Smollett faking the attack to boost his career, but he is doing the same thing. He has gone full celebrity.

Yesterday, Johnson was in New York where he did a studio interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America followed by doing another national television interview with CNN’s Don Lemon.

The case against Smollett is terrible for him, but on the other hand, is the best thing that ever happened to our new celebrity Superintendent who is milking it to boost his resume. I am sure Smollett's lawyer is taking notes."

That’s how close he came to dying in 1930. The same mob that had already lynched two other suspects in a white man’s murder spared the 16-year-old when, as he would tell it, a voice proclaimed his innocence. Cameron thus became the only known survivor of a lynching attempt in the United States when he died in 2006 at age 92. There haven’t been any others since, no matter what Clarence Thomas would have you believe.

Fifteen years after the eventual Supreme Court Justice called his questioning over the Anita Hill harassment allegations a “high-tech lynching,” Cameron was able to witness, in person, Congress apologize to him for never passing anti-lynching legislation. He didn’t live long enough to see the government actually do anything about it. Lynching still isn’t a federal hate crime today; while the bill introduced by the Senate’s only three black members passed in December, as of today, it sits waiting in the House before it is sent to the president for his signature. The bill itself counts at least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, who died by lynching between 1882 and 1968. That’s not far from the count that the Equal Justice Initiative keeps in Montgomery, Alabama, at the new museum and memorial dedicated to the victims of this form of domestic terrorism.

However, even with a surge in lawmakers, historians and activists re-contextualizing the crime for a new era, we continue to see prominent black men, in particular, misuse the iconography of lynching for their own purposes.

Jussie Smollett, the singer and now-suspended Empire actor, allegedly staged his own attempted lynching-style attack, complete with a rope around his neck. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson was indignant last Thursday when he blamed Smollett for supposedly shaming his city. That was an odd and opportune bit of deflection coming from a man in charge of a department with an earned reputation for dishonesty and violence. Rather than going there, Johnson could have stuck with the first point that he made that morning. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” he asked. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Smollett’s exploitation of lynching is not the only one we’ve seen in recent weeks. Justin Fairfax, Virginia’s African-American lieutenant governor, has refused to resign despite being credibly accused of sexual violence by two black women earlier this month. On Sunday, when speaking before the state Senate over which he presides, he invoked both slavery and lynching to describe his ordeal. You can watch his remarks in full below.

Referring first to 2019 being the 400th anniversary of enslaved Africans being brought to Virginia’s shores, Fairfax soon centered himself in the story. “In this moment, we have to decide what the next 400 years look like,” he said. “And if we go backwards in a rush to judgment, if we eliminate due process,” he added, referencing the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, “[if] we allow for political lynchings without any due process, any facts, any evidence being heard, then I think we do a disservice to this very body in which we all serve.” His remarks provoked condemnation from Republicans and Democrats alike. (Fairfax’s office, when contacted by Rolling Stone about his remarks, offered no further comment or clarification.)

Fairfax became a national name in January, prior to Virginia’s explosion of scandals, when he stood apart from that same state Senate when they chose to honor Confederate general Robert E. Lee’s birthday. Fairfax seemed then to have not only an apt grasp of history, but a keen sense of where the political winds were blowing. Perhaps he still does, considering that some Republican elected officials bet that undermining women with misogynist rhetoric and policy will pay off at the ballot box.

Thomas, Bill Cosby, R. Kelly and now Justin Fairfax are all black men who have been accused (or, in Cosby’s case, convicted) of different crimes against women, but nonetheless all saw fit to use lynching as a form of dismissal or deflection. With the exception of Cosby, all of the accusers are black women. Even in the wake of Kelly’s recent arrest in Chicago over a newly surfaced video depicting another incident of alleged sexual abuse, it is difficult to forget what journalist Jim DeRogatis wrote in one of his many reports about the Kelly saga: “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women.”

Misogynoir, the particular kind of intersectional hatred directed at black women, isn’t solely to blame. Just as history has forgotten the many lynched black women, Americans have placed an undue emphasis on the fragility of black male lives at the expense of black female and non-binary lives. It may seem understandable, especially since the killings of Michael Brown, Freddie Gray and so many other unarmed black men and boys at the hands of police helped expand awareness among Americans who didn’t know this was a problem. It is also undeniable that America’s history is littered with the bodies of falsely accused black men, many for sexual crimes. However, as Thomas proved when he escalated matters during his 1991 confirmation hearing, a black man using the word “lynching” carries a unique weight.

Summoning the specter of black men hanging from trees, their lives ended by a raging white mob who sometimes took photographs and picked at their dead flesh for souvenirs as if they were at the county fair, is neither casual nor figurative. Though many argue that lynchings continue, some evolving into reckless police killings, the metaphor remains too casually employed. It is utterly inapplicable even in cases of libel and slander. The insult to the thousands who died this way grows exponentially with every instance of exaggeration.

Fairfax’s chief of staff, Lawrence Roberts preceded his boss’ “political lynching” remarks with a stunning comparison of his own. Roberts published a Facebook post on February 16th that read, in part, “Emmett Till’s case alone should give people pause before rushing to judgment — a young man lynched like so many others without recourse to justice because of a lie,” Roberts wrote, referencing one of the most notorious American murders of all time to defend the lieutenant governor from allegations that he raped one woman during college and later forced another to perform oral sex.

Lynching is such a horrible crime that any comparison to it requires an almost surreal skewing of perspective to liken it to anything one might experience in modern life, even while black. It is just about impossible to hyperbolize, and yet here we are. Hence, it is easy to see why using it to either exonerate yourself or to incriminate your enemies in the service of a hoax would appeal to someone with selfish motivations. If one was going to make the mistake of exploiting lynching, Smollett allegedly chose about the stupidest possible way to do so, and he likely will pay a steep price. (I’d argue that the performer would benefit less from the three years in prison than from education. Perhaps he should be forced to learn the name of each and every victim of lynching documented on those iron slabs hanging at that memorial, including all the “unknowns.”)

But while Cosby was eventually convicted and Kelly soon may face justice, Thomas is still on the bench, casually threatening press freedoms. As you may have seen in the video above, Fairfax’s colleagues preceded his remarks with praise and applause. It would have been better for one of those state Senators to remind Fairfax that no one has been “politically lynched.” It is too loaded an image to conjure, particularly as he is discussing the very history of African bondage in this country. In that respect, Fairfax’s language is worse than Smollett’s alleged actions, because the former is in a position of political and sexual power.

The two women who have leveled accusations against Fairfax, Dr. Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson, have said that they would testify publicly and the Republican-controlled Virginia House of Delegates announced Friday that it will give them that opportunity by holding hearings. Independent of criminal charges or impeachment, neither of which Fairfax could possibly want, that is the due process he has available at the moment. The women will have their platform to speak their truth, and presumably he will have his. If he holds dear the values of equality and justice that he spoke of in his remarks, then Fairfax would be wise to use that time proving his innocence rather than asserting his victimhood."

1. There is little racism in America.

2. The left—white and black—is morally and psychologically impaired.

There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollett faked the “racist” attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders, and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, “I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created … .”

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been “an atmosphere of menace and hate” since Donald Trump was elected president, which made “people want to believe” Smollett’s story. Exactly. Capehart, a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: “I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did.” Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, “I wanted to be wrong.” Three paragraphs later: “But still, I wanted to be wrong.”

This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.

Here’s the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church?

Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?

As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews—certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews—would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.

Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?

Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.

And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history—namely, that America is a racist country.

If just 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, “You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),” that would end the Democrats’ chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens—and in the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history—want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.

And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?"

According to The Blast, Oleg Lee—who has more widely become known as ""That Pillow Guy"" after founding American Pillow Partners—was in talks with Smollett to donate pillows with the actor's image on them to help raise awareness and funds for various LGTBQ organizations that Smollett has supported.

However, Lee now says that they have decided to go in a different direction, in light of Smollett's arrest and charge of filing a false police report.

“I am currently looking for a new celebrity face to partner with to raise money for LBGTQ causes. If the allegations are true, I hope Jussie gets the help and support he needs. I was looking forward to working with him,” Lee said in a statement.

In January, Smollett alleged that two men had attacked him and violently assaulted him for being a gay black man. After weeks of investigation, Chicago police charged Smollett with a felony, claiming that they believe he fabricated the event.

Authorities spoke with two men who were persons of interest in the crime (brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo), but the two have since claimed that Smollett paid them to be involved with the attack, which they allege he orchestrated.

Following his bail hearing and subsequent release from custody, Smollett's legal team issued a statement on the case, asserting that the star denies the accusations against him.

""Mr. Smollet is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,"" the statement read.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the statement continued.

Smollett has since been released from Empire for the remainder of the season, but there is no word on if he is officially fired. If convicted, the actor could potentially be looking at up to three years behind bars."

The brief video of the MAGA-hatted lad smiling at activist/fabulist Nathan Phillips went viral, and within 24 hours we knew Sandmann’s name, where he’s from, and where he goes to school. In fact, his school had to be shut down because of all the death threats. When further video evidence appeared, proving that Sandmann didn’t do anything wrong and in fact tried to defuse tensions, most of the people who threatened him and tried to get him expelled just pretended they were still right all along. It was #FakeButAccurate. That kid had to be the bad guy if he was wearing the bad hat, right? The outrage mob made a few more pathetic attempts to slander Covington Catholic, and when that didn’t work, they stopped screaming about that hoax and immediately started screaming about the Jussie Smollett hoax. It was a busy month for getting angry at things that didn’t actually happen.

Fast-forward to last week on the campus of UC Berkeley, and a hate crime that actually did happen. A young fellow named Hayden Williams was manning a table for Turning Point USA when he was threatened and punched (video courtesy of Campus Reform):

And here’s a clear image of the attacker:

Why, you may ask, is this the right thing to do in this situation? Because now we have this perfect image of the perpetrator’s face! If you know who this man is, PLEASE DM ME! pic.twitter.com/r90A8ozcfS — Brad Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 21, 2019

That was a week ago. You’d think that the attacker would’ve been arrested by now, or at least identified. Right?

Hello?

David Rutz, Washington Free Beacon:

Police are still searching for a man caught on video last week punching conservative activist Hayden Williams in the face on the University of California, Berkeley campus…

Police do not believe the suspect is a student at the university.

That’s it. The cops now claim they’ve identified the attacker, but they haven’t arrested him and they’re not releasing his name to the public.

Would they be protecting this violent thug’s identity if he had been wearing a MAGA hat?

And what triggered the black-clad hooligan? What drove him to such a violent rage? It was a sign reading “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” a reference to the Smollett hoax. This coward got so triggered by a fake hate crime that he committed a real one.

The whole thing was caught on camera. Williams has the injuries to show for it. This attack happened. And what are the headlines?

“Allegedly.”

Once you notice when that word is used and when it isn’t, you can’t unsee it. When a Democrat or some other designated victim claims to have been attacked, there’s nothing “alleged” about it. It’s presented as fact. The attack happened, even if there’s definitive proof it didn’t happen. But if the actual victim of an actual on-camera attack isn’t a designated victim, then it becomes “alleged.” We wouldn’t want to make any hasty assumptions, now, would we?

You can’t just go around punching people for saying things you don’t like. Not even in Berkeley. The cops need to arrest his guy, or explain why they haven’t.

And this is coming from me, a cuck RINO traitor who probably wanted Hillary to get elected. You know things are bad when I make common cause with the Trumpkins who hate my guts!

*Sandmann is now suing the Washington Post for defamation. He’s demanding $250 million, and I’ll be surprised if he gets even a fraction of that. But I’m rooting for him. They tried to ruin that kid’s life, and they need to answer for it. When the media starts going after children for wearing the wrong hats, I’m not listening to any of their whining about how mean Trump is to them. They’ve become as addicted to victimhood as every other Democrat."

Glover spoke to about 50 people in the Joyce Hergenhan Auditorium as part of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications’ Leaders in Communication Lecture Series. She graduated from Newhouse and the College of Arts and Sciences in 1996 with a dual degree in photojournalism and African American studies. She is now a social media editor for NBC Owned Television Stations.

Glover said that social media can make journalists lazy, but getting to a story first should not jeopardize the accuracy of the reporting.

“You’re the gatekeeper of trust,” she said.

Glover said that journalists should not share their opinion on hot button issues, as it could infringe on the impartiality of their work. She implored the room to check facts, look for other angles and cover the whole story.

She cited recent media coverage of the investigation of Jussie Smollett, an “Empire” actor who was charged for allegedly filing a false report of a hate crime, CBS News reported. Glover said too many facts and nonfacts are being circulated by media sources that want to get the scoop first.

Fast journalism can also overlook the importance of individual word choice, Glover said. She said she saw a headline during the Freddie Gray protests, which began after 25-year-old Gray died from injuries sustained while in police custody, The Guardian reported. The headline read: “Woman Beats Boy.”

Using “boy” to describe a young black male has historical implications connected to Jim Crow laws, lynching and slavery, Glover said. She said that she worked with the Associated Press to update their style guide to include an explanation of the problems with using “boy” to describe black males of any age. That update was added to the 2018 AP Stylebook.

Glover also spoke about the importance of diverse newsrooms during her talk. She said diverse newsrooms lead fairer and more balanced reporting, which in turn creates a better media product.

When asked about how to increase diversity in newsrooms, Glover said that imbalances in newsroom diversity result from conscious decisions, not unconscious bias. Hiring decisions are orchestrated and purposeful, she said.

Glover also gave professional advice to students during her talk. She said that students should find people that can help them navigate the media industry.

When Glover asked how many people in the room had a mentor, nearly every hand shot up, but when she asked how many people had a sponsor, only a few people raised their hands. Glover said that mentors provide advice, while sponsors take action. Students need both in order to be successful, she said.

“You need your own board of directors,” she said."

Valencia Love, 47, lives just outside Chicago in Romeoville, and on the form she submitted in Cook County Court stated that she is friends with Kelly.

Love owns a number of restaurants according to records obtained by DailyMail.com, as well as a childcare facility, the Lord and Child Christian Day Care.

She posted that bail despite the fact that Kelly is accused of raping three underage teenagers in this latest Cook County indictment, and the emergence of new rape tapes which allegedly feature the singer and minors.

In addition to the daycare, Love also runs the restaurant Love on the Blu.

Some left comments on the restaurant's Yelp page after learning Love had posted the bail, which were all negative save one that praised the food.

Love responded to that comment by writing: 'Thank you I just help out a Friend if he guilty let him pay for it thru the courts. I am sure some of them.have bail out murders drug dealers etc.'

Kelly appeared in a Chicago courtroom on Monday where his lawyer formally entered a not guilty plea on his behalf to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The singer, who wore an orange prison jumpsuit in court, identified himself to the judge at the start of the hearing, but did not speak again during the proceedings.

Once the hearing was over, Kelly returned to D. O. C. Division 8 RTU, with the singer still unable to cover his $1 million bond.

Hours later he was free, thanks to Love.

Kelly's lawyer, Steven Greenberg, responded to the charges with a statement over the weekend, saying: 'We haven't seen any evidence, any reason to believe these allegations are credible. He's a rock star. He doesn't need to have nonconsensual sex.'

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of 3-7 years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

And on Monday, lawyer Michael Avenatti stated that he is working to obtain new tapes that allegedly show Kelly with underage females.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx spoke about the charges at a brief press conference on Friday.

She went through the charges related to each of the four victims, using only initials to identify the women.

Once the hearing was over, Kelly returned to D. O. C. Division 8 RTU, with the singer still unable to cover his $1 million bond. Valencia Love then posted his bail

First was H.W., who was under the age of 17 between the dates of May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999.

Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

Those include an instance of 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and H.W's sex organ,' an instance where the contact was with 'H.W's mouth' and when 'Robert Kelly touched his penis to H.W's breast.'

The fourth count stems from the claim that 'Robert Kelly touched his mouth to H.W's breast.

R.L. was involved in an incident which occurred between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001 when she was a minor.

That alleged incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

The third victim L.C. was of the age of consent on February 18, 2003.

'A grand jury returned an indictment of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly upon any part of the body of the victim for the purpose of sexual gratification during the course of the underlying forcible felony of Attempt Criminal Sexual Assault,' said Foxx.

The fourth and final victim was identified as J.P., and the incidents she was involved in led to the final three sexual abuse charges against Kelly.

Those incidents took place between May 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, and the victim was under the age of 17.

In that case there was 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and J.P's sex organ,' 'mouth' and 'the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly.'

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

Away he goes: Kelly was seen getting into a black, unmarked van (pictured) as he left the prison facility on Friday

Pick up: Moments after being released from jail, the vehicle pulled over and stopped. A woman is then seen stepping inside the van

Grub: Kelly stopped off at McDonald's for dinner after picking up the mystery woman on the street

Kelly's indictment came one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report.

The speed with which Smollett was indicted had led some to question why the State's Attorney's Office seemed to be taking their time with Kelly but rushing through the Smollett case.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday."

The 36-year-old Empire star had to surrender his passport as part of his bail agreement last week.

Smollett had been ordered to stay in Illinois but a Chicago judge on Monday granted him permission to leave the state so that he can work with his lawyer Mark Geragos.

He paid $10,000, ten percent of his $100,000 bond that was set by Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr.

Jussie Smollett, pictured leaving county jail last week, will be allowed to travel to California from Illinois to meet with his lawyer

It is not clear if it is the same judge who granted him permission to travel. Judge Lyke also set R. Kelly's $1million bond this week.

Geragos, who is based in Los Angeles, has represented Colin Kaepernick, Chris Brown, Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder in the past.

He is now leading Smollett's team of attorneys to fight the disorderly conduct charge he was hit with last week.

He has not responded to repeated requests for comment nor has Anne Kavanaugh, the Chicago-based crisis manager Smollett hired last month.

Police say they have overwhelming evidence Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him on January 29 in a staged hate crime because he wanted a higher salary.

Smollett maintains he is innocent and says he was attacked by homophobic, racist assailants who shouted: 'This is MAGA country!' while beating him, putting a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him.

Smollett's legal team is being headed up by celebrity-favorite Mark Geragos (shown) who is based in Los Angeles. A judge granted the Empire actor permission to travel to L.A. to visit him on Monday

Newly-unearthed tweets from a Twitter account used by brothers - Ola and Abel Osundairo - in 2013 where they make homophobic remarks may also be used as evidence in the case.

'Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that n***a gay right,' Ola tweeted at a man in 2013.

Another tweet read: 'YOU'RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.' It's unclear who Ola was referring to in that tweet.

The actor's explanation for a $3,500 check he gave one of the brothers, which they say was payment for the hoax, is that he was paying him for personal training.

Smollett's bond was set last week by Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke (pictured). It is unclear who gave him permission to go to California

Smollett, according to prosecutors, had previously bought drugs off from one of the brothers and knew them because they had appeared on Empire as extras.

On January 29, the day of the attack, he called them an hour before it happened and an hour afterwards, according to prosecutors.

He also spoke to them when they were in Nigeria for two weeks afterwards.

Smollett has not entered a plea yet.

He is charged with one count of filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony which carries a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.

After being released on bond last Thursday, he went immediately to the Empire set to tell his colleagues he was innocent.

On Monday, Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America to defend the Chicago Police Department's investigation into the attack and double down on his condemnation of Smollett.

Tweets (pictured) from a Twitter account used by brothers Ola Osundairo, 27, and Abel Osundairo, 25, surfaced on Monday as the controversy surrounding Smollett's alleged attack continues

He batted away the Empire actor's claim that a $3,500 check for the brothers he allegedly paid to attack him was for personal training and said there was surveillance footage, physical evidence and testimony that proves it was a hoax which is yet to be presented.

'He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,' Johnson said, rejecting Smollett's lawyers claim that he has been unfairly vilified by the police department and prosecutor's office.

'I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.

Smollett will return to court on March 14, a day after Empire returns to screens.

He has already filmed seven episodes of the popular 20th Century Fox show which will air as planned but he will not feature in the final two episodes.

The cast was filming those two episodes when he was arrested. The studio, which had been standing by him, said last week it was now 'considering its options'."

BREAKING NEWS: I didn’t watch the 91st Academy Awards. This annual event has become far too embarrassing.

I cringe while multi-millionaires play at being the voice of the put-upon and the downtrodden. All the while, they’re clad in designer gowns and bizarre tuxedo clones, their necks draped in ostentatious gold chains and multi-million-dollar necklaces. Meanwhile, they’re carted around to and fro in stretch limousines to attend various events. Along the way, they are offered acres of expensive culinary delicacies to shove down their pampered gullets by the likes of celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.

The revolution will be televised

These are the faces of what fancies itself to be the brave, revolutionary #Resistance.

But it’s a revolution without much of a following. Reportedly, major advertisers for the 91st Academny Awards telecast demanded and got a guarantee from ABC. The guarantee? If the broadcast failed to reach a certain number of viewers, the advertisers would receive a partial refund from the network.





Ouch!

The good news – if you can call it that – is that viewership popped by 6 percent last Sunday. But the 2018 Oscars witnessed the Award Ceremony’s worse ratings plunge in more than 40 years. That means the meager bump generated by the 91st Academy Awards telecast is nothing for the entertainment industry to celebrate.

Regarding the 91st Academy Awards telecast and beyond: No one cares anymore

It seems that Hollywood’s culture-conscious dream factory isn’t getting much love from America’s great unwashed in Flyover Country. You know, the folks who cling (bitterly) to God, guns, and country. Those turning a deaf ear to the concerns of Hollywood’s coddled elite. Those who view little-known actor Billy Porter’s Oscar outfit – tuxedo jacket, bow tie, and flowing black velvet gown – as symptomatic of gender dysphoria.

And don’t, as the media would have us believe, regard this childish silliness as an act of “bravery.”

Playing the race card

And then there’s the latest grandstanding of perpetually aggrieved film director Spike Lee. He stormed toward the exits of Hollywood’s Dolby Theater after losing to “Green Book” in the Best Picture category. But he eventually returned to his seat. He was probably informed in advance that his burning anger was needed to illuminate the Oscar stage.

But Lee did receive a consolation prize in the Academy’s award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his film “BlacKkKlansman.” This provided him an opportunity to deliver the Oscar Award’s annual “America is so racist” speech.

And thus, Lee informed white America there was a way to make up for 30 years of Oscar slights and 400 years of racism.

“The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love vs. hate. Let’s do the right thing!”

Right.

Look out, America: MAGA’s out to get you!

Speaking of hate, the name of newly-disgraced actor Jussie Smollett for some reason did not come up at this year’s Academy Awards. You may recall that the “Empire” actor recently claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.





Allegedly, he was abused and assaulted as he was walking the mean streets of Chicago. He said the attack resulted from his coming down “really, really hard against 45 [President Trump]. I come really, really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” Smollett told Robin Roberts while appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

He further claimed that a pair of white, MAGA-hatted attackers hurled racial and gay epithets at him as they roughed him up. They then poured an “unknown substance” on him and placed a noose around his neck, yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, himself an African American, later held a press conference to say the evidence strongly suggests Smollett staged his own attack.

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Money, egos and tired narratives

It seems Smollett may have done the wrong thing by perpetuating the “America is so racist” narrative to, as some suggest, boost his public profile as one way to boost his $65,000 per episode salary during the upcoming season of “Empire.”

The same motivation may hold true for certain directors desperate to gain that elusive and shiny gold statuette for Best Picture.

It’s getting a lot harder for America’s cultural, journalistic, and political elites to sell their bilge to an increasingly aware American public. That said, shouldn’t they follow ABC’s lead in its treatment of advertisers underwriting the network’s 91st Academy Awards telecast? Shouldn’t these privileged elites give all of us substantial refunds for ceaselessly insulting us, hoaxing us, wasting our time, and overcharging us for the honor?

When TMZ first broke the news of Jussie Smollett’s alleged gay bashing last month, it sent shockwaves throughout the LGBTQ community and the country at large. Reactions poured in from everyone from Kamala Harris to Katy Perry, and even President Trump called the situation “horrible.” Thousands of others took to social media to voice their support for Smollett, while simultaneously rallying against a country so fraught with anger and divisiveness, that a racist, homophobic attack could occur in the middle of one of the nation’s busiest, and most liberal cities.



My immediate reaction to the news was shock and horror, saddened that an attack so bold and blatant could be carried out in 2019. Yet as details began to trickle in in the hours following the initial report, my shock turned to disbelief, and I began wondering if there was more to the story than what was being presented.

Though I have never been attacked, I have been bullied — an ankle-twisting kick during recess that I chalked up to junior high rough-housing; dismissive sneers cast in my direction in high school and college that kept me in the closet till well into my 20s; and that word, the f-word, tossed casually in my face on too many occasions to count. Even the remote possibility that someone could have staged a bias attack on himself, when so many people actually experience forms of these attacks on a daily basis, was enough to make me want to get to the truth.

On a group text with four of my friends (three of whom identify as gay and one who identifies as lesbian), I shared my frustrations with the investigation. “I’m not sure if I should say this,” I began typing, already aware of the implications of what I was about to say, “but I feel like there’s something shady about this whole thing.”

The reaction and rebuke from my friends was swift. “How could you even say that?!” one friend replied. “I’M DONE WITH YOU,” said another, in all caps. “This is not a discussion,” a third friend texted back.

And then, this: “You’re supposed to be a member of the LGBTQ community. I can’t believe you’re not standing up for your own people.”

Three weeks later, Smollett was charged with a felony, accused of filing a false police report to cover up an attack that cops allege was staged in order to boost his public profile, and to promote his career. In a bout of confusion, I felt momentarily vindicated, then immediately disheartened that I was even allowing myself to feel anything other than sadness for this whole situation. Was I wrong to voice my skepticism about the attack? Was I really betraying my own community, the one it took me so long to finally feel a part of, just for some “gotcha” moment in the end?

I hated hearing about what happened to Smollett, but I also hated that no one was willing to have a conversation about it. If his claims were valid, I thought to myself, we could figure out a way to voice our support for him and get the news out about the assault. And if his claims were debunked, I wanted to have a safe space to talk about why we thought he made the whole thing up in the first place. But as it turns out, it wasn’t a conversation my friends were willing to have.

“We are currently living in a very politically fraught time,” says Uri McMillan, Associate Professor of African-American Studies, English and Gender Studies at UCLA. “Identity politics has become especially potent in this moment, as those who are marginalized in our society are witnessing overt efforts to strip them of rights and limit their access to the 'American dream.' And in this particular milieu, there have been pernicious attempts to silence, target, and demonize people of color and LGTBQI-identified folks at the exact time.”

“The pressure to rally around Jussie Smollett,” McMillan offers, “was an explicit effort to push back against the recent rise in white supremacy. In some ways, it was a perfect storm — a way to both critique the racism that MAGA hats emblematize while also attacking homophobia.”

“And yet,” McMillan says, “I now wonder what our too-quick rallying reveals about ourselves, our desires, our fears, and our hopes.”

Oscar Wilde once said, “The truth is rarely pure and never simple.” As officials continue to work to uncover the truth behind this ever-evolving story, here are three things I want my friends to know.

1. Believe victims

When Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson unveiled the charges against Smollett, he said he worried that, “hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”

The most recent available statistics from the Department of Justice revealed more than 7100 hate crime incidents in the U.S. in 2017, up 17 percent from the previous year. Of these incidents, 75% were motivated by race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. And while hate crime hoaxes have been given attention due to Smollett’s alleged actions, a 2018 California State University-San Bernardino study found less than two dozen confirmed hoax cases in the country, dating back to 2016. In short, the chances of a hate crime victim telling the truth are undeniably strong.

Waddie Grant is the founding editor of The G-Listed, a blog that covers urban and LGBTQ culture. He says there is no question that any allegations of harassment or assault should be taken seriously. “For those who share identities as Jussie — Black, LGBTQ, Jewish or a mixture of the any of the aforementioned — and have been physically or verbally assaulted on the basis of identity, as I have during my youth, the seriousness of the hate-crime narrative should be believed in 2019,” Grant says.

Grant also hopes the same wave of compassion and empathy that was extended to Smollett immediately following news of his attack will be extended to those who aren’t in the public eye as well. “As a Black and LGBTQ advocate with a public platform, I see the rallying more frequently when the ‘victim’ is a celebrity,” Grant says. “I’ve noticed more silence, skepticism and judgement when the ‘victim’ is not famous, has no cultural or social popularity, or is not physically appealing to certain demographics.” That has to stop.

2. Be open to questions and debate

Sometimes the narrative that we want to follow doesn’t always play out the way we expect it to. And while the process of arriving at the truth can often be uncomfortable, we shouldn’t be afraid to question the facts and statements being presented, in order to draw out the most accurate and honest conclusions.

Jen Mattiola is an Los Angeles-based life coach whose work with Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) focuses on how people can learn to manage and master their minds, so they can train themselves to reprogram the way they think about and respond to situations. Mattiola says the important thing is to start a conversation, and to listen when others have something to say. “When someone confides in you about a personal conflict or opinion, the best way to show support is by non-judgemental listening,” she says. “This means actively listening without offering suggestions, solutions, or advice. This will make that person feel supported and their feelings validated. Chances are, they are simply wanting to express their vulnerabilities or fears with you, and them sharing with you is a sign of trust. Asking clarifying questions is okay,” she offers, “but let the person have the opportunity to talk.”

Grant says asking questions also prevents us from jumping to conclusions too soon, or placing blame on innocent people. He cites the examples of Andrew McClinton, the African-American man who was arrested for vandalizing a Black church in Mississippi and trying to pin it on Trump supporters, and Yasmin Seweid, who claimed to be the victim of an anti-Islamic attack on a New York subway train, only to recant it days later.

And while my friends accused me of being a “bad gay,” countering a popular opinion or raising red flags isn’t always detrimental to a cause or community. In fact, experts say it’s often a lack of questions that can trigger the most damage.

“Efforts to protect one of your own can often lead to a failure to question why 'we' are rallying around someone in the first place,” McMillan says. “The denial of R. Kelly's crimes against black women and girls for decades is a perfect example of this; or the way the O.J. Simpson trial in the early 1990s unfolded. There is a tendency to prop up singular iconoclasts who are able to succeed, as a representation of the entire communities from which they emerge, especially communities of color. If they succeed or fail,” McMillan explains, “they reflect on us, or so the thinking goes.”

3. Just because you're part of a group, doesn't mean you have to walk in step all the time

While we should always seek to empower members of our own communities, things get problematic when “group-think” replaces dialogue or conflict. As someone of Chinese descent working in entertainment, I appreciated the representation of Crazy Rich Asians. Still, I don’t have a problem with saying that it wasn’t a particularly strong movie when it came to plotlines or character development. Supporting your community and having your own opinion aren’t always mutually exclusive.

“The mob mentality tends to favor absolutes,” Mattiola says. “but your personal credibility depends on your ability to be discerning and skeptical.”

In the case of Smollett, my friends saw my skepticism as a rejection of the LGBTQ community’s call for unity and justice, when in fact, we were all chasing the exact same thing.

“Systemic disenfranchisement engenders fear, and justifiably so,” McMillan says, “because that has been the case for many minority groups in the United States. Still,” he’s quick to add: “queer people are not a homogenous community, nor should we be.”

Says Grant: “I have always put facts before emotions, and have found it liberating to be myself and to subscribe to the truth and logic — even when I have been in the far minority and vilified because I did not follow the ‘you shoulds.’”

At the end of the day, he says, “There is less stress in subscribing to truth.”

Last week, Smollett appeared in court to be arraigned on his felony charge, and I texted our group thread to see what my friends thought about the new developments in the case. This time, their responses came in slowly, and were more measured. “If this is true, it really sets us back in helping real victims,” one friend said. “This whole thing has been upsetting,” texted another.

A third friend’s response: “It sounds bad for him but I’m waiting to see how it plays out in court. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty right?”

Smollett’s next court hearing is March 14."

(Tasia Wells/Getty)

Homophobic tweets claimed to have been sent by one of the brothers involved in Jussie Smollet’s alleged attack have emerged.

According to The Blast, the tweets—which date back to 2013—were allegedly sent by Ola Osundairo, who, along with his brother Abel, was implicated in the racist and homophobic attack in Chicago last month.

Smollett was later accused of staging the attack and was arrested and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime on February 20. The brothers, who say they helped Smollett fabricate the incident, are said to be co-operating with the prosecution as witnesses.

“Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that n***a a gay right,” one tweet allegedly sent by Ola Osundairo reads.

Another tweet reads, “YOU’RE GAY THAT’S WHO YOU ARE.”

Jussie Smollett: the alleged attack

Smollett claims that two men cornered him at around 2am in Chicago on January 29.

He said the men attacked him verbally, calling him a “f****t” and “n****r,” while covering him in bleach and tying a noose around his neck.

Smollett also claims they shouted, “this is MAGA country!”

The incident sparked national outrage, and a search for the guilty parties.

OMG!! THIS is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and PROTECTED against hate! We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved! https://t.co/bprDZ3Luah — Viola Davis (@violadavis) January 29, 2019

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker seized on the event to urge Congress to pass their federal anti-lynching bill.

Lynching is a dark and despicable part of our nation’s history, yet it is still not a federal hate crime. Passing a federal anti-lynching law must be a priority for this new Congress. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 31, 2019

Despite 200 attempts to pass similar legislation over 100 years, lynching is still not a federal crime in the U.S.

Jussie Smollett: questions surrounding the case

The Osundairo brothers were arrested and subsequently released February 15 without being charged with a crime.

“We are not racist, we are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,” they said in a statement.

Police said they had questions surrounding a $3,500 cheque Smollett had made out to the brothers.

Ola and Abel Osundairo claim the cheque—dated six days before the alleged incident—was a downpayment for the attack.

Smollett maintains it was for a “5 week nutrition/ workout programme.”

Chicago police have said Smollett staged the incident because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on the TV show Empire.

Empire: the show must go on

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett’s character on Empire, expressed support for his fellow cast member.

He posted a video of Smollett holding a laughing baby with the message: “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”

The post came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season.

They said they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set.”"

The reports read like a nightmare come true for any queer person of colour.

Jussie Smollett—the gay black actor and star of Fox’s Empire—had been beaten, sprayed with bleach and subjected to a mock lynching, with a noose tied around his neck by his white male attackers.

There was an outpouring of sympathy from the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, and allies of both. But as the weeks went by, sentiment gave way to suspicion as it was claimed that Smollett orchestrated the attack for publicity. Last Thursday these accusations came to a head as the 36-year-old was charged with filing a false police report.

Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” a claim which the actor denies. While some took pity, others expressed disappointment and outrage. Many pointed out that his alleged actions could discredit real victims, serving only to harm people who are LGBTQ+, of colour, or both.

To be a queer person of colour is to be a double target. We face a disproportionate amount of violence from people both in and outside of our communities, never neatly fitting into any single box.

In Britain, race and sexual orientation are the two largest motivating factors in reported hate crimes, of which there was a 17 percent rise in 2017-18. According to Stonewall, one-third of all LGBTQ+ people of colour experienced a hate crime in 2017, compared to one in five white LGBTQ+ people.

In the US, hate crimes have been steadily rising for three years. In 2017 (the year in which Donald Trump was inaugurated) there was a 17 percent spike in reported attacks, the majority of which were against people of colour and the LGBTQ+ community.

“The politics of Trump and of Brexit also pose a legal threat to minorities on both sides of the Atlantic.”

There’s a common theory that Trump’s election and the rise of global populism has emboldened racists, misogynists and homophobes – the fact that Smollett’s purported attackers chanted “this is MAGA country” came as little surprise. But, perhaps even more dangerously, the politics of Trump and of Brexit also pose a legal threat to minorities on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Trump administration has made rolling back transgender rights a centrepiece of its ideology. Trans servicepeople have been banned from serving in the military. Obama-era guidance for the handling of trans prisoners has been removed, as have protections for trans schoolchildren. Elsewhere the White House has attempted to expand discrimination on the basis of religious freedom, repeatedly ignored Pride month and shut out LGBTQ+ groups from its decision-making.

Here in Britain, we are scheduled to leave the EU in a matter of weeks. On Brexit Day, the EU charter—the single piece of legislation expressly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation—will cease to have effect, deal or no deal.

“Jussie Smollett might have lied about his attack—that much remains to be seen. But thousands of others did not.”

While there are other laws which protect the LGBTQ+ community, the government could theoretically scrap these at whim without the underpinning of the European Court of Human Rights. The police watchdog has already warned that Brexit could trigger a spike in hate crimes, as happened during the leave/remain campaign.

Jussie Smollett might have lied about his attack – that much remains to be seen. But thousands of others did not.

The victims of Canadian serial killer Bruce McArthur, for example, many of whom were immigrants from South Asia or the Middle East. The 25 or more trans women of colour murdered in the US in the last year. The victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting.

For all too many queer people of colour, violence is a real and increasing threat, so let’s not allow one man’s mistake to undermine that.

I Need All Evidence.

Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 2

(ThyBlackMan.com) Black history month this year has been one huge ball of confusion, and disrespect. Its far time that we as black people in this country openly allow ourselves, as a whole, to understand racism never ended. We never entered a post racial society, and what we are seeing is the resurgence of open blatant racism. Of course, we know the South is nationally known for its open racism, but it doesn’t bear the burden of this evil alone. This entire country is complicit. There is no place t that our people are safe from racism and the institution(s) it represents. With this in mind we must be careful about the manner in which we deal with our own. I admit I felt like something was missing when the Jussie Smollett story broke, but I was not willing to speak against him because the facts were not out. I was going to stand with him until there was a hard-concrete reason not to do so.

I know it’s an unpopular position as black people have to come to terms with how we deal with our own that are members of the gay community, but when I think about it I had to see him as a black man attacked before anything else. Race determines how our people will be treated in any other area of movement; black women should understand this as the feminist movement reminds us we are black…not just women. Now the news is saying the attack was a hoax he orchestrated, he has been charged, and arrested on for filing a false report.

As I look on social media black people are angry. Some are shocked, and others are saying I told you so. However, all the facts in this case are yet to be seen. I admit it looks quite bad, but I still can’t bring myself to condemn the brother until I have all the evidence. There is a part of me that can’t bring myself to believe he is as stupid as the hoax suggests. Honestly, who writes a check when staging this kind of crime. What comes to mind is the OJ Simpson case. Not the details of the case at all, but the public response to the situation in the sense that there are white people that believe OJ is guilty to this day. There was not enough evidence in that courtroom to make them believe otherwise.

In defense of their position they show us that they understand the justice system is flawed in many ways. All I’m saying is Chicago PD isn’t a department that has a record of handling investigations properly, and the court of public opinion is not the court of law. We, as black people, know of our past and present regarding the police and the courts so why is it that we are so quick to condemn one of our own.

I thoroughly agree that if all evidence soundly points to this brother staging this heinous crime then yes, our people ought to be livid. He would have given those that would seek to harm our people gay or not more ammunition. In a time whereby black people, and people of color, are under constant attack he would have given a narrative that WE, yes all of us, are lying about our oppression in this country. However, if we are by chance wrong…it showed that we are willing to sell out our own so why should white people care about us when we clearly don’t care. Again, we would have given our oppressors ammunition. It is very important that we try to hold our peace until ALL the evidence is presented.

We seriously need to see how this will play out. What disturbs me in many cases is that white people will defend their own to a fault…even when they know they are wrong. Not saying we should do such, but we need to be a bit more patient on how we decide to speak on a matter. Innocent until proven guilty is not something we should just remember when dealing with white people in this country, it is something we must be sure to keep in mind when dealing with our own first.

On Feb. 20 my husband and I were on our way home from a VA appointment and we got stuck in the traffic due to the crash on Highway 20 by Blue Lakes. The officers were telling everyone to either go around to 175 Hopland or to get a hotel in Mendocino County. Our problem was my husband was very ill and strapped to a gurney in the back of the vehicle and he needed to get home to his medicine and his special hospital bed. During this time the VA was in contact with the CHP and the CHP was in contact with their supervisors to see what they could do to help.

I want to thank the VA, Mendocino CHP and the Lake County CHP for making it possible for us to get back to our home.

The Mendocino CHP escorted us to the Lake County line and the Lake County CHP got us as far as Blue Lakes, which was four miles from our home. Then the officer told us of a back road that we could take around Blue Lakes and into Scotts Valley that would get us home.

We do not know what we would have done without the help of these wonderful officers and the VA personnel. Again thank you very much.

Plethora of wannabees

We seem to have a plethora of presidential wannabees trying to convince the American people that socialism is the way of a perfect future for the United States.

Has one of these wannabees recently visited any one of the top four socialist countries in the world and compared any of these countries to the United States? Note the names of these four countries and in parentheses you will find the political party controlling the country.

Considered as the top four socialist countries are People’s Republic of China (Communist Party of China), Republic of Cuba (Communist Party of Cuba), Laos People’s Democratic Republic (Lao People’s Revolutionary Party) and Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Communist Party of Vietnam).

Some think of Sweden as being a socialist country, however, that is not true, although the Swedish Social Democratic Party has won most elections in Sweden since 1932, the country has never adopted socialism as its official ideology.

All people should study the differences between socialist and non-socialist countries before jumping on a socialist political band wagon.. The one thing you will find is that the four countries listed above do not have a free press.

In the U.S., at this time, we find a very biased press. People who do not seek out a news media that reports both sides of the story are lead astray. We have seen that in the now on-going Jussie Smollett case where even wannabee Kamala Harris, along with many others, did not wait for the police investigation. Harris referred to what had happened as a ‘modern day lynching’ and she wants to represent all of us in Washington, D.C.

Now turn your sights on Venezuela. Is this the kind of country we want the U.S. to become? I suggest readers check out a May 29, 2018, Wall Street Journal article by Nathan J. Robinson, “What Venezuela Tells Us About Socialism.”

Study wannabee Bernie Sanders five years ago and you will find that at that time he was holding Socialist-ruled Venezuela up as an example of what the American dream should be. Makes one wonder just what he wants for the U.S. now.

If all readers study the history of each of the countries mentioned, they will have a greater understanding of what has happened and continues to happen in socialist and communist countries around the world.

Maybe, just then, they will want to stand up for and speak up for the United States of America.

Like Germany 1933

Every word out of Donald Trump’s mouth is a lie. Today America is like Germany in 1933. A would-be dictator is insanely incapable of telling the truth. Trump’s fascist liar-virus has infected everyone in his administration and right-wing media cronies (Just like the Nazi Party) who all play fast and loose with the truth. Talk about “trickle-down” policy, the only trickle-down that works is his gullible Brownshirt followers who blindly defend him with cries of “fake news” whenever they hear or read anything about him they disagree with or he has lied about it.

Just like Adolf, Trump uses fear to maintain his base. But as the great Franklin Roosevelt said: “The only thing to fear is fear itself, not the unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes reason.” For example, Trump screams that crime in border towns is at an all-time high to provoke fear but that is just another big lie. He stokes the bogeyman fear of socialism and communism that will supposedly cause his base to pay a few dollars more in taxes (but less if reasonable tax rates go into effect). But going to the doctor without going into bankruptcy is not socialism. And then there is the fear of Islam and Iran. Trump has cancelled the Obama plan to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump is a madman who bashes the American people over the head with fear. He has terrifying mental problems and for the sake of all humankind should be removed from office pronto.

Chicago has had a rough couple of weeks when it comes to the American news cycle. The Night King decided to make the city his vacation spot, Jussie Smollett and the Chicago Police Department have been in a fight to see who sounds the least credible, and R. Kelly’s latest arrest is a reminder of why it’s taken so long for the alleged predator to be brought to justice (again) to begin with.

Yet, in the midst of the national coverage of Chicago, there’s scarcely been a mention of the biggest thing happening in the city: a huge mayoral primary on Tuesday, Feb. 26, that could likely change the face of Chicago more than any TMZ- style story has over the last few weeks.



There is a field of 14 Democratic candidates (the only viable party for mayor) and it features three African-American women; 71-year-old Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle; 56-year-old former Chicago Police Board President Lori Lightfoot; and 35-year-old community activist and lawyer, Amara Enyia. Two of them , Preckwinkle and Lightfoot, are in a three way tie at 14 percent heading into Election Day with Chicago political scion Bill Daley. While three black women may seem like a sign of progress for the Windy City, according to Enyia, black Chicago is still in a very precarious place.

“Chicago has been a top three city in population loss,” Enyia said during an interview with The Root in her cozy campaign office during a brisk evening. “We’ve lost over 250,000 black residents in the last 15 years alone.”

To put that into perspective, Chicago has lost roughly a Cleveland- or Pittsburgh-sized number of black folks in the last decade and a half. Some moved to the suburbs, but many are leaving Chicagoland entirely, heading to Houston or Phoenix or Atlanta. With that loss of population comes a loss of political power in the city. Why is this happening? It might have something to do with the “Chicago Way” that Amara Enyia is fighting against in her campaign.

When I first saw Amara Enyia, I was eating at an old-school deli shop next to her campaign office across from DePaul University. Incredibly tall and poised, she walked into the same spot with what appeared to be a body guard, and she looked like she was doing cosplay of Michelle Obama with the Secret Service. Enyia was only halfway through her order when a DePaul University student walked up to her, praising her campaign from 2015 and saying he was voting for her again. The candidate smiled and bantered for a bit before even noticing me chowing down on my pre-interview cheesesteak. She complimented my sandwich choice, betraying a natural way around people that fits her profile as a long-term activist with deep passion for the city. You’d want Amara Enyia as your neighbor, friend, business partner or mayor, and yet in many ways she is a Chicago dream that has yet to be realized.

While Chicago isn’t the mobbed-up paradise you see in the movies, the city is incredibly politically top heavy. As I spoke to campaign staffers in her office, I kept hearing references to “the Chicago Way,” which, quite honestly, I thought was something people only said in movies or mawkish CBS series’ about cops or firemen. When I asked Enyia about it, she first chuckled and then made it clear the Chicago Way is a real thing.

“How does that phrase go?....Nobody wants somebody that nobody sent for,” she said. “You have to be selected. You have to kiss the ring in order to be moved through the system, in order to be known [In Chicago].”

Enyia is definitely not someone that anybody linked to Chicago politics has “sent for.” She’s the consummate outsider, a millennial activist with Nigerian immigrant parents who got her bachelor’s, law degree and doctorate from the University of Illinois. She’s running on a very progressive platform with policies like creating a Chicago public bank; allowing those jailed on old marijuana drug charges to get a foot hold into the new legal market; and a “Ban the Boot” program where people are given the chance to pay off car and boot fines with community service if they can’t afford to pay in cash.

“Chicago stifles innovation, ” she said during a long monologue about opportunities for young people in the city.

If the only way you can make a difference in Chicago politics is to be ushered in by powerful families like the Daleys (who have already had a father and a son run the city in the last 40 years and another Daley is in a three-way tie to be the next mayor), how does the Enyia campaign plan on countering that? Through the power of hip-hop.

Chicago, perhaps more than any other America city, has a history of politically active rappers. Common was a long-term surrogate of the Obama campaign. In 2011, I interviewed rapper and producer Rhymefest, who ran unsuccessfully for Chicago’s Ward 20 city council seat; most recently, Chance the Rapper and, yes, even Kanye have been involved in politics, not just in words but with their cash as well. What the Enyia campaign couldn’t do through name recognition or deep city Chicago Way contacts, they are doing with the newest power pillars in the city.

“My first conversation with [Kanye] happened out of the blue, he called my cell phone out of the blue...and said like…Hi?” she chuckled.

“He’d heard about my work, and it was actually a visioning conversation. He has all of these businesses, fashion, shoes, what does it look like to have these factors back in Chicago—for working people—he also talked a lot about housing. It was one of the most out-of-the-box conversations I’ve had in a long time. ”

Initially, Enyia was apprehensive about Kanye’s politics, especially given his off-brand praise of Trump, Blexit, and half a dozen other problematic things he’s done over the last few years. However, in the end, she sensed that he really loved the city of Chicago, the South Side that raised him, and she could make an alliance with someone she didn’t always agree with so long as it helped the city.

“He felt in his spirit that my campaign was what Chicago needs. That was how it started, it definitely gave me a level of notoriety.”

The same goes for her relationship with Chance the Rapper. Chance has been a huge activist in Chicago, donating millions of his own dollars to public schools and mental health programs.

“He was at many of the same organizing spaces as me, but our paths had never directly crossed,” Enyia said.

Eventually, Chance met Enyia after a city council meeting for the “No Cop Academy” movement. No Cop Academy is a collection of 85 community groups in Chicago proposing that instead of spending $95 million on a new police academy for the city, that money be used to reopen closed schools and other projects of community investment. Enyia and Chance vibed on the things that needed to be done to improve the lives of Chicagoans. The rapper, who infused his lyrics with bible quotes, has not only campaigned for Eniya but donated $400,000 as well.

“He [Chance] has lent a level of visibility to the campaign nationally—and he’s valuable because his support is substantive, it’s not just, ‘I like this person and vote for them.’ It’s ‘we’ve been in some of the same trenches’ on these issues.”

The Amara Enyia campaign may be a longshot. T he polls conducted by local stations 24 hours before the election don’t place her in the top two spots, the candidates who would potentially meet in a runoff in April. However, polling for the race has also been scattered and turnout is expected to be low, which opens the chance for an outsider with a good ground organization to stage an upset.

Kelly had a sold-out show. However, after he was arrested Friday, that show has been canceled.

SEE ALSO: Some No Name, Pitchy R&B Singer Disrespected Keith Sweat And Gets Demolished On Twitter

A concert venue in Neu-Ulm, Germany wrote on Facebook, “Regarding the new and objective facts, we have decided to cancel the contract.” The show was scheduled for April 12. “We regret the fans’ understandable disappointment and ask them to turn to the tour’s organizer” regarding possible reimbursement of their tickets, Ratiopharm Arena wrote.

The show was selling so well that April 12th that organizers transferred the show from the 7,200-person MHP Arena in Ludwigsburg to the 9,000-capacity Ratiopharm Arena. Back on Feb. 6, the venue defended the Kelly show on Facebook, “Everyone (in particular: every woman) has the right to personally evaluate the allegations in the room, to form an opinion about R. Kelly and to freely express one’s own opinion – artistically as well as personally, positively as well as negatively, freedom of expression is a high good, and there are at least very serious allegations in the room.”

The venue added, “Anyone who personally considers that the presumption of innocence that is valid in the rule of law – for good reasons – is obsolete and that feels called upon to take the place of the rule of law as an instance of social ostracism, is called upon to show caution and restraint. We certainly do not want to presume this competence. This was the ultimate motivation behind our decision, which we did not make easy.”

Kelly posted the $100,000 for his bond on Monday afternoon. He also pleaded not guilty to all of the 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse he was facing for his alleged crimes against four female accusers.

Attorney Michael Avenatti recently gave a video to Cook County prosecutors, which could be where Friday’s charges stemmed from. He tweeted Monday morning that he would be giving another video purportedly of Kelly “engaged in sexual assault of a minor.”

The lawyer previously said he was hired last April in connection to multiple allegations of Kelly sexually assaulting minors. He claimed to have a 45-minute VHS tape as evidence, which, despite its similarities, was not the same video that got Kelly indicted in 2002 — and acquitted in 2008 — for child porn.

The local paper named him Citizen of the Year.

But that was not enough attention for Joly because police finally arrested him for arson for burning his own house down in 2017. That fire killed his three cats and two dogs.

The police long believed Joly set fire to the house, but needed more evidence. From The Detroit News:

Despite the attention on Tulloch, police had another suspect in mind. They quickly zeroed in on Joly, according to the police report. Joly told them that, on the morning of the fire, he bought $10 of gas at a Marathon station so he could cut his grass. He began to mow, but it got too hot so he stopped with the backyard half done. He went to work at the church and got a call from Moore at 1:02 p.m., said the report. Moore had forgotten to pack her lunch so asked Joly to bring it to her at work. The couple share one car. Joly returned home, which was two miles away, went inside for a minute or two, and left, he told police. The fire was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m. The sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire, Grove said in the police report. “The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being scene,” wrote Grove.

The police also asked people around Joly about the fire:

Two people who worked with Joly at St. Johns United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, said he had been frustrated the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law, according to the report. The church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, when asked by police about a possible motive for the fire, said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, held five days before the blaze, hadn’t received more attention or protests. Contacted by a reporter, James declined to comment. But Shelton quibbled with the way police characterized her remarks, saying she had no idea if Joly was frustrated by the lack of controversy. “Not sure I said that,” she wrote in an email. “I have no idea about anything, never heard Nikki comment in any fashion about anything like that.”

However, police detective Aaron Grove wrote in his report that “Shelton and james both described Nikki as very deceptive and stated that when it comes to Nikki there are ‘layers of manipulation.'”

The report also found gas on Joly’s clothes he wore on that day. The FBI and police interviewed Joly two weeks later and he didn’t admit or deny setting the fire.

Joly’s attorney said he did not own the house, which means no insurance money. He also thinks the motive lacks evidence due to the honors bestowed upon Joly by the city. That answer is quite easy. Some people need as much attention as possible. Once their stardom begins to die they need something else to happen to propel them back into the limelight.

Joly is innocent until proven guilty just like Jussie Smollett, who allegedly staged his own fake hate crime in order to raise his celebrity status and pay on the show Empire. Smollett claimed two whit men attacked him in Chicago, placed a noose around his neck, and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

Unfortunately, these alleged hoaxes will keep people from taking a person’s word when it comes to hate crimes.

Their Responses Might Surprise You.,[],https://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/uploads/2019/02/screen_shot_2019-02-26_at_10.53.29_am.png?itok=ViYJN09s,"['fletcher', 'college', 'male', 'surprise', 'case', 'dont', 'student', 'watch', 'responses', 'think', 'trump', 'told', 'asked', 'students', 'smollett', 'hate', 'jussie']","Street reporter Austen Fletcher journeyed to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) recently to ask students their feelings on the latest developments into the allegedly orchestrated hate crime of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

While some students were predictably averse to outright admitting Smollett was in the wrong — since the apparent hate-hoax served a “larger truthful narrative,” so to speak — other students agreed that fake hate crimes hurt real victims and deepen divides, and acknowledged that the actor should face repercussions if he were to be found guilty.

“We have to look at both sides: [Smollett] wanted to show a problem in America, so that’s why he did it. But … because people found out, that approach did not work; it actually did the opposite of what he intended,” said one male student.

“No, I don’t think [Smollett] should go to jail,” said a female student, adding that “there already is a race war [in America], so maybe he’s adding fuel to the race war, which I don’t agree with that, but I don’t think he should go to jail for it.”

Another female student argued that what Smollett allegedly did in staging the hate crime is not a “big deal” given historical context.

“People are making such a big deal about if he were to fake it, and the consequences that he should go through, but I know so many counts of white people in history that have faked something that a black person has done to them, and it was never this serious … I just have a questions as to why this is such a big deal,” she said.

When Fletcher noted that faking hate crimes actually marginalizes and hurts victims of real cases of targeted harassment, the woman nodded along.

A group of five male students were not familiar with the latest developments in the Smollett case, but when they were informed by Fletcher about the actor’s arrest, the students agreed that media plays a role in working to divide Americans and that Smollett should “go to jail” if he is guilty of staging the attack.

Another group of male students told Fletcher that they have mixed feelings, or fully support President Donald Trump, though they do not go around showing their support on campus. One student suggested he’d be “suspended” if he were to wear his “MAGA” hat on campus a lot. “I don’t want to get jumped,” he said.

Another student in the group told Fletcher, “I think we should just try to encourage and look for the positive things with the president. With the media, things get misconstrued … I hope [Trump] does well. … I think we should all be united. America!”

Smollett claimed on January 29 that he was targeted for being black and gay by two white Trump supporters in the streets of downtown Chicago. The men physically assaulted Smollett, called him a “n*****” and a “f*****,” tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him, and told him he was in “MAGA country,” he claimed.

According to Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson, the attack was orchestrated by Smollett, and a threatening MAGA-themed letter he received some two weeks before the attack was also sent by the actor.

Smollett was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Christopher claims that Smollett bad mouthed him around Hollywood because he was intimidated by Christopher and wanted to be the IT Black, gay actor.

In a rant worthy of Kanye West, Christopher put up an Instagram post [since taken down] where he railed on and on that he was among other things, “The Father of Black Gay Hollywood.”

Christopher’s prose had a manic self-aggrandizing quality that bordered on disturbing.

“In a lengthy rant that seems to have had no real point, except to brag…Milan wants us all to know he fathered us and we are all his sons,” reported Aazios, which captured the rant before it was taken down (see below).

“In his rant he mentions several of his accomplishments which are all great but sir Karamo was the first openly gay male to have his real relationship play out on reality TV.”

Karamo refers to Queer Eye for the Straight Guy‘s Karamo Brown.

His claims to greatness were myriad but let’s confirm what we can:

“I was the first openly gay Black male to have his relationship played out on Reality TV.”

FALSE: Sean Sasser, who was Pedro Zamora’s boyfriend on The Real World San Francisco certainly was before Milan’s time. Sasser passed away from HIV complications in 2013.

“I was the first Black celebrity to be a spokesperson for PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylactic) aka Truvada.

TRUEish: Christopher was in last year’s “F*** Without Fear” HIV prevention campaign, launched by the Los Angeles LGBT Center who teamed with Christopher to launch its new “PrEP’d AF” outreach campaign.

“The main goal is to raise awareness that PrEP prevents HIV without impacting people’s ability to have active and fun sex lives, reported HIV Plus last year.

In the same interview he doubled down on his claim that “a lot of rappers are secretly bisexual.”

“The more attention the campaign gets, the more people it reaches and, hopefully, it reaches men who have sex with men who don’t identify as gay or bi,” Christopher continued. “A lot of influential people in the music industry follow me on social media, so [hopefully] this reaches them.”

We’ll skip to the end which is the part that’s more fun and [I’m sure] unintentionally hilarious: “I’m fine AF [True], I have a beautiful smile [We’ll give him that], banging body [obviously], fat ass [no comment], and a big a** dick [unconfirmable at press time].”

Comedian Sampson McCormick, who is also an “openly Black celebrity” who has been a spokesperson for PrEP, said of Christopher’s rant: “I’ve met Milan a few times, and we’ve always had pleasant exchanges, but let’s operate from reality (not TV) real life–the only reason that child started getting leverage was because he kept telling everybody he was Barry Gordy’s nephew or some shit, back when he was claiming himself as Milan Christopher-Gordy, and Barry Gordy told him to shut the fuck up. Since then, it’s been all grainy ass sex tapes shot down at the motel 6 and a new picture of his naked ass every other month. The only thing that child hasn’t show us, is his insides! Still love him though, but he needs to SIT. DOWN.”

Chicago Police Sup. Eddie Johnson said Empire actor Jussie Smollett “still has the presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.”

Johnson told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts on Monday that, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Johnson said that detectives still considered the Beautiful singer as a victim and not a suspect until the final hour before they had to release the two brothers who were arrested in connection with the case. If the brothers were charged, Smollett would still be seen as the victim.

“What’s important for people to realize is, it’s not the Chicago Police saying he did something. It’s the evidence, the facts, the witnesses that are saying this,” he said.

Johnson said that the key piece of evidence was a cancelled cheque signed by Smollett. The brothers said Smollett “paid them $3,500 with a cheque … to carry out this incident.”

Smollett’s lawyers claim the cheque, made out to the Osundairos, was for personal training sessions and nutrition plans.

“The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that. And I’m acutely aware of that,” he said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary.

That claim is sure to be disputed, if not mocked, by those for whom grievance and identity politics are a profession or a psychological crutch.

(Article by Joel B. Pollak republished from Breitbart.com)

Yet it remains true — and was thrown into sharp relief this week, as the Jussie Smollett case turned from one of the most horrific attacks in recent memory to the worst hate crime hoax in history.

There are two reasons the media, Hollywood, and the Democratic political elite believed Smollett’s claims.

First, he belongs to several victim categories: black, gay, and even Jewish (albeit via his father), according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Second, he appealed to the left’s shared contempt for America in the Trump era: he claimed, for example, that the fact people doubted his story “says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

The crucial detail in Smollett’s account, which ultimately proved its undoing, was the claim that his attackers had shouted, “This is MAGA country.” It was a gratuitous flourish in Smollett’s story, a “fact” that was not necessary to establish that he was a victim, but which pointed the finger directly at the president and his tens of millions of supporters.

Chicago is hardly “MAGA country,” given that it is overwhelmingly Democratic. Its politicians are also viciously anti-Trump: after the 2016 election, the city took down all of the honorary street signs it once erected in his honor, which were near the Streeterville area where Smollett claimed he was attacked.

But to the left, “MAGA country” is an idea about what the U.S. is, or has become. That is why so many hate crime hoaxes are believed.

It is worth examining what Trump’s “MAGA country” really means for the groups Smollett claimed to represent.

Blacks: Under Trump, black unemployment is at its lowest level in history. Trump pushed for, and signed into law, sweeping prison reforms backed by leaders of the African-American community. He pardoned the late boxer Jack Johnson, whom Barack Obama neglected. He also elevated a new generation of black conservatives in public life.

Jews: Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. embassy there. He deported a Nazi who had lingered in the U.S. under Obama. He directed the FBI to solve the mystery of bomb threat hoaxes haunting the community. He is the first president with close Jewish relatives — his daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren.

Gays: Trump championed gay voices within the GOP since his campaign, when he backed Peter Thiel at the Republican National Convention. Trump appointed U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking gay officials. His administration has launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality.

(Trump has also been a good president for other groups, including women — though the “cis-gender” Smollett would not qualify.)

The arguments against the claims above are familiar. Trump is alleged to have called neo-Nazi white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, “very fine people.” Trump took on black football players who knelt during the national anthem, and restored a ban on transgender soldiers serving in the U.S. military.

But the Charlottesville claim is a lie, and in the other two cases Trump was defending the prominence and integrity of core national institutions.

Measured on the post-modernist scale of identity politics, which prizes symbolic confrontations with power, Trump is a villain.

In a world where concrete achievements count, Trump is our most “progressive” president ever.

According to reports, the payout is somewhere in the $60 to $80 million range. Add that to his multi-million dollar Nike ad campaign, and it’s clear that martyrdom has been a lucrative gig for the former quarterback. So lucrative, in fact, that he won’t return to professional football for less than $20 million. Beggars can’t be choosers, they used to say. Just one of many old nuggets of wisdom that’s been turned on its head in our upside down world. Kaepernick has turned victimhood into a business. And business is good.

(Article by Matt Walsh republished from DailyWire.com)

His case may shed some light on the Jussie Smollett situation. As it becomes more and more inescapably clear (though it was pretty obvious from the beginning, we should note) that the “hate crime attack” against Smollett was an elaborate and poorly staged hoax, people may wonder why a guy with a cushy job on a network television show would risk it all on such an idiotic ploy. The people confused on this point have not been paying very close attention. As Kaepernick demonstrates, victimhood pays. We have elevated victimhood to a desirable status. Our children are raised to crave it, envy it, seek it. The great paradox of modern American culture is this: victimhood equals power.

It wasn’t always this way. There was a time when a man would never dream of inventing a story about getting beaten and defiled. If anything, his tall tales would run the other direction. If he was going to fabricate a physical altercation with imaginary assailants, he would be the victor in the story. He wanted to paint himself as the tough guy, not a pitiful sap who got doused with bleach by a couple of random punks. If he really did get into a fight, he would exaggerate to make you feel sorry for the other guy. He didn’t want to be a victim. To him, victimhood was degrading and humiliating. Even if he really was a victim, he did not like to think of himself that way.

I don’t mean to suggest that there is shame in being an actual victim. I only mean that if we have to err in one direction or another, it’s probably better to err on the side of embarrassment at our victimhood rather than excitement. Better to not see ourselves as victims when we are than to see ourselves as victims when we aren’t. At least the former stems from a healthy human instinct. The latter is gross and small and pathetic and it is rapidly creating a country full of Smolletts.

However, what he’s accused of doing is even worse than what Smollett is charged with.

Joly, according to the Detroit News, is a transgender man who hails from Jackson, Michigan. In the fishbowl of Jackson, Joly was kind of a big deal when it came to LGBT rights. That’s why he said that people were after him.

And when his house was burned down in August 2017, it might have seemed like that was happening.

“When the home of Nikki Joly burned down in 2017, killing five pets, the FBI investigated it as a hate crime,” the Detroit News reported Monday.

“After all, the transgender man and gay rights activist had received threats after having a banner year in this conservative town.

“In the prior six months, he helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized the first gay festival and, after 18 years of failed attempts, helped lead a bruising battle for an ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gays.

“For his efforts, a local paper named him the Citizen of the Year.”

In September of 2018, 13 months after the blaze, authorities made an arrest in the case: Nikki Joly.

While Joly’s lawyer claims there’s a lack of motive — evidence in his favor, of course — authorities say that Joly had a sinister reason behind the blaze: attention.

“Two people who worked with Joly at St. John’s United Church of Christ, where the Jackson Pride Center was located, said he had been frustrated the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law, according to the report,” the Daily News recounted.

“The church officials, Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, when asked by police about a possible motive for the fire, said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, held five days before the blaze, hadn’t received more attention or protests,” the News added.

“Contacted by a reporter, James declined to comment. But Shelton quibbled with the way police characterized her remarks, saying she had no idea if Joly was frustrated by the lack of controversy.”

While the public’s suspicion had originally fallen on an opponent of the LGBT rights campaign, law enforcement believed Joly, who had recently married his longtime girlfriend, Chris Moore, was responsible for the blaze.

“Joly told them that, on the morning of the fire, he bought $10 of gas at a Marathon station so he could cut his grass. He began to mow, but it got too hot so he stopped with the backyard half done,” the Daily News reported.

“He went to work at the church and got a call from Moore at 1:02 p.m., said the report. Moore had forgotten to pack her lunch so asked Joly to bring it to her at work. The couple share one car.

“Joly returned home, which was two miles away, went inside for a minute or two, and left, he told police.

“The fire was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m.,” they continued. “The sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire, (Detective Aaron) Grove said in the police report.”

Two dogs and three cats perished in the blaze, in spite of the best efforts of neighbors to save them. For whatever reason, PETA hasn’t jumped on top of this one.

A hearing on the case is set for March 8, the Daily News reported.

Both Joly and Smollett are innocent until proven guilty, of course, but both are accused of hate crime hoaxes and both did it in the name of discrediting their opponents; both also apparently had attention on the brain when they orchestrated the crimes they’re accused of.

I’m trying to think of analogues among conservatives, but the closest thing I can think of is that time incoherent loudmouth Morton Downey Jr. (almost certainly) falsely claimed he was ambushed by three skinheads in a San Francisco International Airport bathroom back in 1989, who drew a swastika on his face and chopped his hair off.

This 30-year-old hoax, ironically, was regurgitated by KCBS Radio in San Francisco as a parallel to the Smollett case, as if conservatives had invented the genre. Whatever takes the attention off, I suppose.

The point is, where are the analogues? Where’s James Woods falsely claiming he’s been attacked by antifa? Vince Vaughn alleging elderly members of the Weather Underground knocked him out and told him that the pigs are going to get what’s coming to them?

That’s not happening. Instead, what we’re getting are hoaxes that seem designed to speak to Who We Are In 2019, only to later find out that, no, that’s not who we are. This is an overwhelmingly liberal phenomenon, which is something the mainstream media will go to some pains to avoid admitting.

Yes, crimes of hate happen. These alleged hoaxes are no excuse to discount them.

However, when we see an alleged crime that seems designed to fit a narrative that America is a place fraught with violent bigotry, perhaps we ought to think twice before taking the claims as gospel.

When Chicago police spoke during a press conference last week, they shared that they believed Smollett was dissatisfied with his Empire salary, and implied that they suspected he intended to use the notoriety he gained from the faux-attack to leverage for more money.

According to TMZ, sources from the show say that if this was the reason, he never suggested to anyone involved with Empire that this was the case. Reportedly, no one ever heard him complain abut his salary.

Smollett was reportedly making $125,000 per episode, and was in the middle of a long-term contract. The insiders also explained that neither Smollett nor his reps made moves to get the actor a bigger payday.

The outlet notes, however, that Smollett's music career was his main focus as of late, and that he had been upset that his first album did not do as well as he was hoping it would.

Following his arrest on charges of filing a false police reports, Smollett was dropped from Empire for the remainder of the season. Producers of the series issued a joint statement regarding their decision, explaining that it was a tough call to make.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us” read the statement from Empire executives Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer that was published by Variety.

“Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement continued.

Smollett's legal team also issued a statement on his case, following his bail hearing and release, taking time to reaffirm his declaration of innocence.

""Mr. Smollet is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,"" the statement began.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the statement added.

If he is convicted, Smollett potentially faces up to three years in prison for filing a false police report."

ABC’s Tom Llamas flew to Venezuela to interview Dictator Nicolas Maduro and gave the leader free rein to lie about America without any tough questions and very little pushback.

“Tonight, the tension building in Venezuela’s power struggle. Aid trucks set on fire over the weekend, as opposition groups tried in vain to bring over much-needed food and medical supplies, donated by the United States. Tonight, in a rare interview inside of his presidential palace, Nicolas Maduro telling ABC News he believes the U.S. is preparing a military invasion to get him out,” Llamas, a correspondent and weekend anchor, said at the beginning of the broadcast.

Throughout the report, Maduro makes numerous false statements, while Llamas, in a voiceover, seems eager to defend the dictator and find fault in the Trump administration. For example, Maduro claims, without evidence, that the U.S. “wants Venezuela’s oil and they’re having to go to war for that oil.”

Instead of correcting the record, Llamas pivots to point out that Vice President Mike Pence met with Venezuela Interim President Juan Guaido “and other South American leaders opposed to Maduro.” In fact, America doesn’t need Venezuela’s oil, nor is our country in need of it. America is now a net exporter of oil. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the U.S. “is now the largest global crude oil producer in the world.”

Maduro, in the segment broadcast last night, is then shown saying: “Everything that the United States government has done has been condemned. They’re trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America.”

Condemned by who? As Newsbusters reported, “… the U.S.’s stance against Maduro’s regime had actually been backed up by many world powers, who also recognized interim-President Juan Guaido as the rightful leader.”

Instead of pointing out the facts, Llamas says Maduro is “refusing to budge” and “will not beg for the U.S.[‘s] help.”

Maduro then says Venezuela has had democratic elections for “for 20 years,” yet many world powers have criticized the elections as being rigged.

Finally, Llamas appears to put the blame on President Donald Trump by saying Maduro is willing to meet with the U.S. president, but “the Trump administration has made it clear, they do not want to negotiated with him.”

That is the shortened segment ABC decided to broadcast during “World News Tonight.” The full interview between Llamas and Maduro is not much better, although Llamas does push back on some aspects of the conversation. He still gives Maduro free rein to make wild claims that could be easily debunked, yet Llamas keeps steering the interview to allow Maduro to slam Trump.

In addition to the oil claim, Llamas tells Maduro what Trump has said about him, and allows Maduro to insult Trump by saying the president should “inform himself a little bit more” and that he is just reading speeches prepared for him by other people.

Llamas does push back against Maduro by telling the Venezuelan dictator about a United Nations report estimating hundreds of people have died due to Maduro’s government. Maduro responded by telling Llamas he was a liar, “just like Trump.”

Now compare this to the situation faced by Univision’s Jorge Ramos, whose tough interview with Maduro landed him and his crew in hot water with the Venezuelan government, who allegedly confiscated their footage and belongings."

Jussie Smollett apologizes to the ‘Empire’ cast and crew but insists that he’s innocent

Actor Jussie Smollett issued an apology to the cast and crew of ‘Empire.’ However, he is maintaining his innocence, according to CNN.

Twentieth Century Fox Television executive VP of communications and publicity, Chris Alexander, said Smollett was on set filming on Thursday. A source from the meeting said Smollett stuck to the statement that was put out in the media by his attorney.

The statement, blaming the legal system and the media for his woes, apologized for any embarrassment the recent allegations may have caused. Smollett appeared in court Thursday, speaking only to confirm his name to the judge.

The judge granted Smollett $100,000 bail Smollett paid a $10,000 bond, agreeing to give up his passport and remaining under supervision until the case is adjudicated.

Smollett is “on hold” for Friday’s shoot of ‘Empire.’ The filming of the season finale episode of Empire is in progress this week and next week.

New election ordered in North Carolina

Officials in North Carolina ordered for a new contest in the ninth Congressional District after the Republican candidate Mark Harris was confronted by evidence that his campaign had financed illegal voter-turnout efforts, The New York Times reports.

The unanimous ruling by five members of the Board of Elections, outlined how the politician orchestrated an absentee ballot scheme to sway the race. This case is the single undecided House contest in the 2018 midterm election.

“It was certainty a tainted election,” said Robert Cordle, the state board’s chairman.

Kraft Heinz Loses Billions as Tastes Shift and S.E.C. Investigates

Food giant Kraft Heinz released a surprising report Thursday, disclosing a large plunge in their brand and a $15.4 billion write down, The New York Times Reports.

The write down, appearing to come from a shift in how consumers eat, emphasized fresh food over processed products.

The popular food giant received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, tied to an investigation related to the company’s accounting and controls, last year.

The company’s stock dropped 21 percent from the news. Chief Executive, Bernardo Hees, said the company’s earnings fell short due to insufficient cost savings.“For that, we take full responsibility,” he said.

Roger Stone cannot speak publicly about case, judge rules

Roger Stone’s ability to speak publicly about his case, or the investigation, against special counsel Robert Mueller was restricted Thursday by Federal Judge Amy Berman, according to CNN.

The case and investigation are related to his interactions in 2016 with Russians and the Trump campaign.

The restrictions come four days after Stone posted then removed photos of Jackson on his Instagram that had, what Stone called, a “Celtic cross” behind her head. Jackson ordered him to court, where he contradicted his explanations for the post and for his remorse.

Jackson said Stone could issue no more statements on the radio, press releases, blogs, media interviews, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat posts about the case, which has drawn immense media interest.

Empire's Terrence Howard may have given his co-star Jussie Smollett a talking to, following the revelation that Smollett's claims of being a hate crime victim may have been false.

After Smollett surrendered to the Chicago police after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, Howard reportedly had a ""complete meltdown,"" according to TMZ. The celebrity gossip publication noted that Howard, 49, would not come out of his trailer on the Empire set. Apparently, Howard reportedly never fully believed Smollett's story that two men jumped him in Chicago after calling him racist and homophobic slurs, as a source told TMZ. Howard is said to have even questioned Smollett over his account of his alleged attack in late January 2019, and urged him to ""come clean"" after brothers Abel and Ola Osundario were detained in connection with Smollett's alleged beating.

When Smollett, who plays the son of Howard's character on Empire, apologized to the show's cast and crew upon his release from police custody on $100,000 bond, Howard was reportedly not around to hear it.

According to TMZ, Howard wasn't the only member of the Empire family to think Smollett, 36, may have been lying about his alleged attack. And that may just be one reason why show producers decided to remove Smollett's character from the finale episodes of the series' fifth season. As, in a statement signed by Empire's co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, they wanted to ""avoid further disruption on set"" (via CNN).

However, just because Howard may not have been happy with Smollett and may not have totally believed his claims, the actor appears to still have his co-star's back. On Saturday, Feb. 23, 2019, Howard posted a video of Smollett on his Instagram page, showing the actor holding and playing with a baby while on a flight. In the caption, Howard wrote, ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.""

But Howard didn't only share the post in support of his colleague — he also defended Smollett against hateful commenters, as reported by CNN. After one person left a comment criticizing Smollett, Howard responded, writing, ""Sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie I know."" Howard continued, ""The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I've called my son for five years. It's God's job to judge and it's ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.""

So, it'd seem that Howard may have possibly needed convincing from Smollett about his alleged attack, but, clearly, Howard is fully on his TV son's side.

Despite the Chicago Police Department reportedly believing that Smollett lied about the alleged hate crime he faced in an effort to somehow further his acting career, Smollett has maintained his innocence. ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" his attorneys said in a statement (via CNN). ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

And, according to TMZ sources, Empire executives don't buy that Smollett planned an attack because he wasn't satisfied with his current pay on the show, as the Chicago PD has claimed. The gossip rag noted that neither Smollett nor his representatives ever expressed that he was unhappy with his per-episode salary. He reportedly makes $125,000 for each episode of Empire, not including what he earns for his contributions to the show's music.

Besides having Howard's support — despite the actor's reported doubts — Smollett also has co-star Taraji P. Henson in his corner. Henson, who plays the mother of Smollett's character on Empire, opened up about the alleged hate crime against Smollett during an appearance on The Dr. Oz Show. ""At his very core, he is love. That's just who he is,"" she said. ""And love is always gonna win.""

However, Henson, 48, said all that before it was reported that Smollett may have faked his attack. But, since we haven't heard Henson speak out against her TV son, we'll just assume that she's still on Team Smollett, at least until there's any undeniable proof that he orchestrated his attack.

According to Page Six, Smollett's next court date is scheduled for March 14, 2019."

You come up with a fake feminist herstory. That’s exactly what Netflix created when it produced REVERSING ROE.

It’s the crockumentary of the century.

“The film offers candid and riveting interviews with key figures from both sides of the divide,” claims Netflix’ laughable synopsis. A key figure would be Jane Roe herself—the late Norma McCorvey. She’s nonexistent in a movie that wouldn’t exist without her historic role. Norma never aborted her child but made a loving plan of adoption instead. She became pro-life and devoted the rest of her years to aborting the Roe decision. So, naturally, she was aborted from the film.

In one of the film’s massive omissions on the history of abortion in America, the Catholic Church is completely missing. There would be no prolife movement without Catholics, and their fight began long before Roe. It’s why eugenicist/socialist/”feminist” Margaret Sanger repeatedly vilified Catholics, as evidenced in her alarmingly anti-human 1922 book, The Pivot of Civilization.

REVERSING ROE invokes fear about the back alley, but never mentions legal abortion’s most infamous back-alley abortionist—convicted murderer, Kermit Gosnell.

The crockumentary shows how the historically-challenged will rely on any lie to promote their brand of fake feminism. It’s a world where, magically, thousands of (mostly women-run) pregnancy help centers don’t even exist. Poof! Gone.

Millions of women actually oppose abortion. According to the latest Gallup survey, 47% identify as prolife, 48% identify as “pro-choice”, and 4% (interestingly) have no opinion. REVERSING ROE claims to be “intense and unflinching in telling the whole story”, but then proceeds to tell a partial and intensely distorted story where only middle-aged white males, apparently, are anti-abortion; over 20 are featured. That’s strange since most national pro-life organizations are headed by women: March for Life (Jeannie Mancini), CURE (Star Parker), Live Action (Lila Rose), Students for Life (Kristan Hawkins), Americans United for Life (Catherine Glenn Foster), SBA List (Marjorie Dannenfelser), National Right to Life Committee (Carol Tobias), And Then There Were None (Abby Johnson), American Life League (Judie Brown) and the American Association of Prolife Obstetricians and Gynecologists or AAPLOG (Dr. Donna Harrison). Of these amazing prolife women, the film only shows NRLC’s Carol Tobias. The late Phyllis Schlafly, founder of the Eagle Forum, is briefly featured, too.

REVERSING ROE doesn’t highlight the late Dr. Mildred Jefferson who was the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, prominent prolife physician and factivist, and the co-founder of the NRLC. Dr. Alveda King, a leading figure in the pro-life movement, told me that she was never interviewed either. She doesn’t fit the liberally colorized narrative where only white people fight the violence of abortion. The Netflix crockumentary, however, show all kinds of diversity (gender/age/race) on the pro-abortion side. And it conveniently ignores the patriarchal fact that seven white men in black SCOTUS robes gave us the violence of Roe in the first place.

Netflix offers free “educational screenings” in classrooms for their propaganda, calling the completely imbalanced REVERSING ROE “essential viewing…regardless of where you stand on the issue.” The University of Notre Dame took them up on this and held an event, recently, accusing the prolife movement of—get this—white supremacy.

This would be laughable if it weren’t about the slaughter of over 62 million human lives since Roe, nearly one million a year. Today, those aborted lives are disproportionately black. Rabidly pro-abortion Notre Dame professors calling pro-lifers ‘racists’ for tireless efforts to protect mothers and their unborn children, regardless of race or ethnicity, is truly a Jussie Smollett moment. Just. Fake. News. It’s a bizarre form of projection as they defend a violent institution actually birthed in eugenic racism and elitism.

I’m a black adoptee and adoptive father. I guess I’m a ‘racist’ for believing and fighting against what famed anti-poverty (and pro-life, adoptive mother) Fannie Lou Hamer considered to be ‘genocide’ in the black community—abortion. More black babies have been aborted than born alive in New York City where eugenic pseudoscience spawned Planned Parenthood. Actual and fatal violence against black lives happens 247 times a day inside the nation’s largest abortion chain. Death has always been the ultimate and inevitable consequence of the putridity of racism. The abortion industry, enabled by billions of taxpayer dollars just over the past few years, kills unborn black lives at rates up to five times higher than the majority population—isn’t that white supremacy?

The only thing that reigns supreme in REVERSING ROE is deception. There are so many lies in this misinfomercial that it would take another documentary to highlight them.

Predictably, REVERSING ROE demonizes religion as a prolife motivation yet reveres religious folks who support abortion. “Reverend” Tom Davis (the former chairman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Clergy Advisory Board) falsely claimed: “When it first became legal, Planned Parenthood was not keen on abortion.” According to the New York Times, Planned Parenthood unanimously approved a “policy recognizing abortion and sterilization as proper medical procedures” and “called for liberalizing the criminal laws that prohibit them” in 1968—two years before abortion was legalized in New York and five years before Roe v. Wade.

The prolife movement denounces any form of violence regarding abortion, but that doesn’t stop REVERSING ROE from connecting a non-violent movement to a handful of heinous violent acts. Footage of Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue, is manipulated to make it appear he’s advocating violence. Newman says: “The weak link in the abortion chain is the person actually doing the abortion….we’ve been effective at targeting particular abortionists. If they don’t have abortionists, the place closes down.” Newman, unequivocally, denounces violence. He was referring to informational campaigns—like his resource AbortionDocs.org—to shut down abortionists, legally, by exposing their many health code violations and any criminal records they have.

So, if you’re looking for an historical documentary on racism and abortion, watch MAAFA21.com. Unlike REVERSING ROE, it delivers the truth; it doesn’t abort it."

LaDuke wrote last night, the Chicago police are saying there’s a lot more evidence against Jussie Smollett that they haven’t released yet.

We know from the available evidence already out there, the police department already has a strong enough case to put the actor behind bars.

That said, there are ways Smollett could have staged the bogus incident so as to have made himself come off as more credible. Here are five of them.

1. Dress up as a Trump administration official and then go out to eat (Subway sandwich: optional).

Kellyanne Conway can attest to this. So can White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.

Of course, these things happen when you have Democrats openly encouraging their party faithful to get in the faces of Trump supporters, no matter where they are.

2. Attend a rally in support of Donald Trump.

Who could forget this one:

Protests outside a Donald Trump rally in downtown San Jose spun out of control Thursday night when some demonstrators attacked the candidate’s supporters. Protesters jumped on cars, pelted Trump supporters with eggs and water balloons, snatched signs and stole “Make America Great” hats off supporters’ heads before burning the hats and snapping selfies with the charred remains. Several people were caught on camera punching Trump supporters. At least one attacker was arrested, according to CNN, although police did not release much information.

Because TOLERANCE™ and stuff.

3. Don a MAGA hat and then head out for a day of shopping.

Even if it doesn’t get you physically attacked – or on the wrong end of a gun, you’ll be told your business isn’t wanted, and urged to go elsewhere.

That is assuming you don’t get cursed out by store employees first.

4. Tell your college classmates you’re a big fan of Ben Shapiro’s, and have invited him to speak on campus.

You may not personally be assaulted, but you can best believe they’ll do everything they can to violently shout down viewpoints they find “offensive” in an effort to restore “safe spaces” on campus.

5. Show up to a pro-life march along with your fellow high school students, while wearing a MAGA hat.

Not only will the digital lynch mob go after you full force, but so-called “respectable” members of the community will, too. Not to mention the threats your high school will have to endure.

Keep in mind that I’m most definitely NOT encouraging anyone to stage anything like this. I’m just saying that if they did, it would make them a lot more believable, considering how often actual attacks against Trump supporters/defenders have been happening over the last few years.

While that statement was met with ridicule for the hyperbole it was, it echoed a sentiment that has been percolating online among Trump’s biggest supporters.

Trump supporters frequently coin new phrases to explain away the fact that their president is disliked by many. Previously, they’ve tried Trump Derangement Syndrome. Now, it’s Magaphobia.

One of Trump’s most ardent fans and extremely online right-winger Jack Posobiec began tweeting about it in the wake of both the Jussie Smollett hoax and a conservative supporter getting punched in California. It’s a way to show how Trump’s opponents are driven mad by people’s support of the president.

America has seen a rise in hate crimes since Trump took office, with a 17 percent increase in 2017. But don’t tell that to persecuted MAGA stans who can’t see beyond their own myopic world view.

It was when Posobiec asked his followers for instances of #Magaphobia that his panicked proclamations of victimization were revealed to be as banal as can be.

Fears of tense family dinners and TV shows with viewpoints that you disagree with were the most Posobiec’s fans could come up with. He also started to get trolled.

While Trump supporters have faced instances of violence, they support a president who has been rabid in inciting his base of followers to commit acts of violence against journalists and his political opponents and has stoked fear toward people of color.

Nothing any Trump supporter—people who are largely white and male (like Posobiec)—has faced compares to anything persecuted minorities in America experience.

They’ll be alright.

This time, a former aide, who is a Black woman, for 45 during the 2016 election campaign says he kissed her without her consent.

According to NBC News, “Alva Johnson, 43, alleges that Trump singled her out prior to the rally in Tampa, Florida, and then forcibly kissed her — which the suit says amounts to common law battery — on a campaign recreational vehicle in the presence of other campaign aides.” This incident reportedly happened in August of 2016.

In the 39-page suit, Johnson claimed she turned her head to avoid Trump’s lips but the kiss landed on the side of her mouth. Johnson said she “felt reduced to just another object” of Trump’s “unwanted sexual attention.” Johnson added she “was nothing more than a sexual object he felt entitled to dominate and humiliate.”

Johnson was also accusing the “Trump campaign of gender and race discrimination, alleging in the lawsuit that she was paid less than her white or male colleagues despite her success organizing volunteers and planning rallies, among other duties.”

“This accusation is absurd on its face,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders babbled in a statement. “This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple, highly credible eyewitness accounts.”

Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany ranted, “The Trump campaign has never discriminated based on race, ethnicity, gender or any other basis. Any allegation suggesting otherwise is off-base and unfounded.” Witnesses in Trump’s camp deny all of Johnson’s allegations.

If you are wondering why the Alabama native even joined the campaign of sexist, racist and accused sexual predator, her logic was, “She thought Trump’s business acumen would help poor Black residents in her home state. She said she was feeling disillusioned by President Barack Obama, for whom she voted in 2008 and 2012.”

Johnson left the campaign in October of 2016, after the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced. That said, in a May 2017 Alabama radio interview, she said, “He is more incredible in person than I think you would even think as you see him on TV… He’s just the nicest guy. … He treats everyone as if they are a part of his family.” She allegedly was expecting to be given a job as “second-in-command” at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon.

Her lawyer explains this quote by saying she was locked into a nondisclosure agreement at the time and was “saying what she thought Trump and his supporters wanted.”

“What a thing to wake up to,” Kassam said in a message on Twitter. “My personal Facebook profile has been deleted, with no warning or explanation. I can no longer administer my fan page, with over 150,000 likes.”

Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the incident. “I’m sure this was an ‘accident’ like I’ve been hearing from the social media masters,” he wrote in a tweet. “Funny that the accidents only happen one way.”

A few hours after Trump’s comment, Kassam reported that his page had been reinstated. Facebook did not provide Kassam with any explanation for the ordeal.

It wasn’t clear if Facebook disabled the page due to American or European politics. The company hired Nick Clegg, a former head of the U.K.’s Liberal Democrats, as chief of global policy and communications in October. Kassam posted in praise of British activist Tommy Robinson on Facebook on Monday — shortly before he was suspended — calling a documentary Robinson produced a “must watch for anyone interested in how mainstream news orgs collaborate with hard left groups to create fake news about the political right.”

Facebook announced Robinson was banned from Facebook and Instagram at nearly the same time Kassam was suspended.

Kassam, a former Muslim and former editor for conservative media outlet Breitbart London, is scheduled to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland later this week. (RELATED: Facebook’s New Rules Ban Employees From Changing Colleagues’ Minds)

“The blunt instrument of censorship has long been used as a means of aggression and a form of violence against conservative thought and speech,” Kassam said in a statement to The Daily Caller.

“This latest foray by Facebook, against someone who is a bestselling author and mainstage speaker at CPAC, seems to imply a new salient in their assault on conservatives,” Kassam added. “No longer are they simply targeting the ‘fringe’ or ‘edgy’ voices. They are also coming for people with a far more mainstream following.” (RELATED: Internet Trolls Are Turning Facebook’s Content Moderators Into Rabid 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists)

It’s the third time Facebook has been accused of censoring conservatives over the last several weeks. Last week, the Facebook-owned Instagram allegedly prevented users from liking posts published by Donald Trump Jr. Earlier in the month, Facebook and Instagram were both accused of blocking posts from users who were critical of actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly staging his own assault.

Facebook said in a statement, “This profile was removed in error and was restored as soon as we were able to investigate.”

Editor’s note: The Daily Caller updated this story with more details after the reactivation of Kassam’s account.

But we've updated The Hollywood Gossip with the latest information regarding this actor... his arrest... allegations that he orchetrated his own attack... and the possibility that the police have it wrong and he actually did not do so.

It's a lot to take in. Take a deep breath and join us down below:

Late last week, Smollett was arrested on a charge of falsifying a police report.

This is a felony that could result in a three-year prison sentence for the Empire star.

During a press conference announcing the arrest, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson repeatedly scolded the actor.

""Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" he told the press, referring to the charge that Smollett staged his own assault on January 29, lying about two assailants beating him and taunting him with racial and homophobic slurts.

Added Johnson at this time:

Why would anyone — especially an African-American man — use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?

How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?

On Tuesday, Johnson spoke to Good Morning America and emphasized once again that Smollett fabricated his account of events.

In an interview with Robin Roberts, the authority figure said the following:

""Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave.

""There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.""

Smollett reportedly paid Abimbola Osundairo and his brother $3,500 to help him with this scam.

The siblings worked as extras on Empire and Abimbola also worked as Smollett's personal trainer. This is a photo of them:

Now, the actual check Smollett cut to Osundairo has been made public.

It was written on January 23, six days before the attack, and check's memo line reads, ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don't Go).""

Inisders say the actor was starting to train for an upcoming music video titled ""Don't Go,"" in which he had to appear shirtless. It was scheduled to be filmed on February 23.

The $3,500 check was $600 per week for the workout plan, plus $100 per week for the nutrition plan, over five weeks, a source close to Smollett told ABC News.

This would actually seem to be evidence in Smollett's favor, that the paid the siblings for reasons that did not include the assault, but Johnson still sounds confident in his case.

""It's important for people to recognize that it's not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,"" he told Roberts on GMA.

Elsewhere, ABC News has obtained copies of text messages supposedly sent between Smollett and one of the Osundairo brothers, whom he calls ""Bon.""

As you can see below, the two are talking about exercise and meal plans in the days preceding the alleged attack.

""This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss,"" Bon writes on January 25.

There's also discussion about the aforementioned music video:

Again, this would appear to be support Smollett.

Just four days prior to the attack, there's no talk of Jussie and this brother planning it.

TMZ also now writes that no one associated with Empire ever heard a peep from Smollett about dissatisfaction with his salary, which Johnson listed as the main reason why he plotted this non-assault.

It was to raise his profile and earn a raise, Johnson has claimed.

Jussie was making a reported $125,000 per episode.This was on par with actor Bryshere Y. Gray, who plays his brother, Hakeem. (Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard, the show's leads, reportedly make $250,000 an episode.)

However, another possible motive has emerged.

This whole story grows more confusing by the day.

We'll continue to update readers with the latest as news breaks.

Do you believe Jussie Smollett?"

In a new piece GQ published Monday (Feb. 25), Staples once again served up some quote-worthy comments as he defended Jussie Smollett. The California native kept it all the way real about the self-proclaimed ""Gay Tupac,"" a person Chicago police believe staged a hate crime to make himself look like a victim.

""Ah, man, free the Juice Man,"" Staples said about Smollett, who was released from Cook County Jail on bond on Feb. 21. ""He's just running a little scam. Hopefully he don't get time because police are smoking people, falsifying police reports, and they get to go home, so let my boy go home.""

As you can see, Staples is invested in defending the embattled entertainer, whose story has drawn some skepticism from people from the very beginning.

When he told police about the attack, Smollett claimed that two White men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before they punched him and wrapped a noose around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

After gathering evidence they believed proved Smollett's recounting wasn't true, Chicago police charged Smollett for falsifying a police report before arresting the actor. While things aren't looking great for Smollett, Staples still offers up an ounce of support.

""Shit, the fact he feels like he has to do that says more about this world and less about him,"" he said. ""Because nobody wants to do that.""

He claims Howard did no such thing!

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: What happened on the day Jussie Smollett, 36, returned to the Empire set after being released from police custody — still remains a mystery. The bodyguard of Terrence Howard, 49, who is often seen on the show, is denying a recent report, which claimed Howard angrily confronted Smollett and demanded to know the truth about his alleged attack during an altercation on February 21. In a long message posted to Instagram on February 25, Howard’s bodyguard vowed that “evil will not break up the solidarity of the ‘Empire’ family,” before he called the report “lies” and “irresponsible journalism”.

“I don’t normally address rumors and hearsay because I’m well aware that comes along with this business,” the bodyguard began his caption of a photo of him, Howard and Smollett during a scene on Empire. “However every once in awhile you come across something that happens to be so outlandish that it has to be addressed. Let me be clear @tmz_tv my brother #TerrenceHoward has NEVER EVER been in a shouting match with our beloved friend and castmate #JussieSmollett at any point. Nor has he ever confronted or grilled Jussie about any matters legal or otherwise. In fact your entire post (meltdown, refusal to leave trailer, tension, disdain, etc) is non factual.”

“Ahem [emoji] Whoever you’re paying for this fabricated info is taking you for a ride. But I guess it’s like Denzel Washington said “In our society now, it doesn’t matter if it’s true. Now it’s just first. Who cares, get it out there. We don’t care who it hurts.” Evil will not break up the solidarity of the #Empire family. PERIOD”. The bodyguard added the hashtags, “#Lies #Rumors #tmz #WeLoveJussie #IrresponsibleJournalism #DontBelievetheHype”.

In the comments of the post, the bodyguard answered a few fans who responded with praise that he “spoke out.” In reply to one person, he said, “I wasn’t going to let that BS story go unchecked!” Taraji P. Henson‘s makeup artist, Ashunta Sheriff also responded to post, writing, “Facts!!!”

The report in which Howard’s bodyguard denied also claimed that Howard never believed Smollett’s story about his alleged attack from the very beginning.

Smollett returned to the Empire set on February 21, after he was released from police custody in Chicago. Authorities charged him with filing a false report for allegedly staging a January 29 attack on himself, making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett has denied the charge and was released on $100,000 bail. His next hearing is set for March 14."

The messages, published by ABC News, were apparently sent from 20 to 28 January between Smollett and one of the brothers, who is referred to as Bon.

Smollett originally told police he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack on 29 January in Chicago – during what authorities now allege was a hoax.

In a conversation dated 20 January, the Empire actor is asked how many times a day he eats (”Like twice”) and whether there are any foods he avoids (pork, beef and dairy, which is “horrible” for his voice).

On 22 January, Smollett’s conversation partner asks him when a music video shoot is due to take place, and on 25 January, he sends Smollett a meal plan. The actor responds saying he will check it on his computer and asks: “When do you leave town?”

Bon answers: I leave Tuesday night”, which would have been 29 January.

On 28 January, Bon, per the text conversation, tells Smollett to try to do 45 minutes of cardio, which the actor says he has done in the morning.

“Easy. Good work,” Bon replies.

ABC News also published a copy of a check Smollett apparently wrote to one of the two brothers, which has a memo line reading: “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go)”.

Sources close to Smollett told the network the actor was getting ready to shoot a music video titled “Don’t Go”.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who delivered a powerful statement to the media last week after Smollett turned himself in, told Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts on Monday that there is “a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet” as part of the case.

Johnson has accused Smollett of allegedly staging the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

Smollett has denied orchestrating the assault and his lawyers have previously said the actor felt “victimized” by claims he had played a role in the attack."

""You, right now, have in your mind, your perfect woman. And when you find that woman, she will be a goddess to you. We fall in love with the goddess, or the god, within that person, and then when we actually meet the human being, then we gotta learn how to love that one.""

Baldoni agreed, adding his marriage to actress Emily Baldoni isn't just what fans see on Instagram. ""There's so much more to a marriage than just the smiling photos at the beach,"" he said.

Pinkett Smith also talked about her 21-year-old marriage to Will Smith, admitting how her ""hardcore daddy issues"" triggered some problems in their relationship.

Smollett is facing disorderly conduct charges for filing an alleged false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racially charged homophobic attack. As TheGrio previously reported, texts between the singer and the Nigerian-American brothers who are accused of helping him orchestrate the “attack” confirm that the $3500 check at the center of this case was indeed for fitness training and not payment for the alleged hate crime. This calls the claims by the Superintendent of Chicago PD, Eddie Johnson, into question.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” the police chief told “GMA” anchor Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

He added, “It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

Smollett denies any role in staging the crime and turned himself into police last Thursday morning.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. The actor pleaded not guilty and was released after posting 10 percent of his bail. Empire producers then announced that Smollett’s character had been written out of the last two episodes of the season.

Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime case headed to grand jury next week: report

Jussie Smollett attack: Chicago police arrest two ‘persons of interest’ for battery"

As President Donald Trump is inclined to do, he frequently comments and tweets about “fake news.” This most often upsets the news media, which maintains they do not indulge in fake news.

That, of course, is sharply debated by those who are the targets of or suffer from those news stories. Some events are more useful than others in demonstrating how crazy some of these tales really are. For this noble purpose, the fates have provided the celebrity bright light Jussie Smollett, who is called the “star” of a less-than-well-known TV show called “Empire.”

For those who may not know the gory details, when the story first broke, Smollett had reported that he was attacked about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 in a Chicago neighborhood by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured a chemical substance on him, which he believed was bleach. Smollett said at least one assailant told him “this is MAGA country” during the alleged attack, as reported by The Washington Post.

He then appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” to further expound upon the racial and homophobic nature of the attack, to assert that the seriousness of the event was not being fully acknowledged by the public, and to insult everyone who did not immediately rise to his cause.

However, Chicago police have discovered a substantial amount of evidence supporting the position that the reported hate crime was really a hoax. This evidence is sufficient to have caused the police to charge Smollett with a crime. The “Empire” bright light now looks like a dim bulb.

Even some of the Left’s more dependable critics condemned Smollett, and others have moved from their previous joyous and unbounded support to a neutral “let’s wait and see’” position.

In the coming days, weeks, and months, this story will play out, hopefully getting as much attention as the initial media-friendly story of racist Trumpsters attacking a gay black man in a troubled Chicago neighborhood in the middle of a 20-degree February night.

If there is anything good to come from this, it’s that it is no longer a tale of horrible racism committed by Trump supporters. Given that a neutral body, the Chicago PD, has put the charge of racism to rest and put a truthful perspective on this event, it opens the door to demonstrating other false narratives promoted by supposed victims of discrimination.

Many “fake news” stories are automatically accepted as fact without adequate vetting because they fit a particular narrative. A few examples are:

At Drake University, several students were targeted in racist notes this past December. The notes were, in fact, written by one of the students targeted in the notes.

Covington Catholic High School students who were in Washington, DC, for a pro-life rally were blamed for hassling Native American Nathan Phillips. The disruption turned out to be caused by Phillips, a known troublemaker.

A liberal journalist for Mic.com was fed a story about a Native American being harassed by a Trump supporter, but it was never confirmed … because it was a hoax.

Reported hate crimes directed at Muslims, blacks, and a bisexual student in different states recently were all later revealed to be hoaxes.

All of these examples were taken as truth and reported before their lack of credibility came to light. Real journalists practicing real journalism could have saved everyone affected by these false stories a lot of grief had they done their jobs in the required way.

Much of, perhaps most of, the news media reveals itself to be biased toward certain topics — like racism, homophobia, anti-Islamism — and biased against other topics — like Donald Trump, conservatives, and white people, particularly men.

New standards have replaced the traditions of truth, objectivity, fairness, due diligence, and balance among way too much of the news media. The new standards seem to be: Getting it out fast is better than getting it out right; assuming truth is better than finding truth; and ad sales.

News should be news and opinion should be opinion, and never the twain shall meet. That is a rule that is these days routinely broken. This represents a true crisis that has rendered news journalism a profoundly tattered and broken profession.

When President Trump calls bad news “fake news,” and when he says that purveyors of dishonest news are the “enemy of the people,” he is reacting to what the purveyors of these stories have created for themselves.

When the American people are deliberately misinformed by the very voice upon which they depend for essential information, how is that different from the work of propagandists?

Rather than reacting to the revealing of their corruption as a wake-up call, many of them merely issue denials and keep traveling the same road.

Few things in life ever match their ideals, but news journalism has fallen to an historic low. The question now is: Can news journalism ever re-earn the trust of the American people?"

Smollett, an actor, faked a racist and homophobic attack on himself in Chicago as a means to draw attention to his dissatisfaction with his salary. The news media went wild covering first the attack, then the revelation that the incident was faked. I, like millions of other Americans, had never heard of Smollett before this story broke. Not one iota of the story had any effect on our lives. Yet the news media covered it as if it were a story of major significance and as if every American needed to know every detail.

That’s what’s wrong with the modern American news media, especially television networks and cable news: they treat events of grossly unequal importance as if they are all equally important. They waste time and resources covering the Jussie Smolletts of the world as if they are just as important as the alleged crimes of the president, the crisis of gun violence, the border wall, or the withdrawal of troops from Syria. The news media, once venerated in this country, are now among the least trusted institutions in the nation, and they deserve it."

According to TMZ, executives of Smollett’s hit show Empire do not believe that he staged the attack over his salary on the show. The Chicago police have reported that Smollett’s motivation to stage the January 29 attack against himself stemmed from his Empire salary. According to them, he wanted to raise his profile with the attack and get paid more per episode.

But Empire execs, including Lee Daniels, do not think that it adds up. According to an insider, Smollett never once went to show executives to gripe over his pay. The insider dishes that if Jussie was indeed upset about his salary, he kept it to himself and didn’t mention it to any of his co-stars or higher-ups.

The actor was reportedly raking in a cool $125,000 per episode which is the same as Bryshere Y. Gray, who plays Jussie’s brother on the Fox show. Lead actors Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard are earning double Smollett’s salary at $250,000 an episode but again, Jussie never let it be known if his salary was, in fact, bugging him.

The insider goes on to report that at the time of the “attack,” Jussie’s main focus was the new music that he was releasing. The actor was upset that his first album didn’t do as well as he had expected, which means that he felt a lot of pressure for this album to do better than the last.

Most recently, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson made an appearance on Good Morning America to give the Chicago Police Department’s version of the events that went down that evening. As The Inquisitr reported, Johnson sat down with GMA’s Robin Roberts where he re-told how the CPD was able to piece together the case that has captivated the nation.

“The entire time we investigated, [Smollett] was treated as a victim. We picked up the two individuals after we identified who they were…We took them in and were legally able to hold them for 48 hours…the 47th hour that we had those two in custody is when it changed.”

Johnson then told Roberts that the two suspects, who ended up being the Osundairo brothers, were told by their lawyers to tell the truth. Once they were questioned, it was uncovered that they were no longer suspects in the case, but rather witnesses. After that, Smollett’s story unraveled and it’s still believed by the Chicago Police Department that money was a motivation for the attack.

Johnson says that the police have more information that goes against Smollett’s version of the events of that evening and they will present it in court."

Discussion of the “Empire” actor’s staged hate crime and subsequent arrest for filing a false police report was a glaring omission during Monday’s show, despite co-host Mika Brzezinski teasing the segment ahead.

“Still ahead, Chicago police blasted Empire actor Jussie Smollett last week, accusing him of staging a hate crime because he was unhappy with his salary. We’ll get Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s reaction to the alleged incident, next on Morning Joe,” she said.

But Emanuel’s reaction never came. In fact, no comments were forthcoming because Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough never posed any questions to the mayor whose city was at the center of Smollet’s story as he claimed two masked men attacked him last month, hurling racial and homophobic slurs at him while placing a noose around his neck, pouring a liquid on him and yelling “this is MAGA country.”

Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct amid filing a false police report after turning himself in to Chicago police. He could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

After the commercial break on Monday’s show, Emanuel talked with the “Morning Joe” co-hosts about everything from the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, Mexico and funding of the border wall along the southern U.S. border as well as his accomplishments as mayor. Missing was any talk of Smollett.

“What happened during the commercial break between Mika’s tease and the interview itself? Did Emanuel, in his tough-guy persona, perhaps inform the hosts that he would accept no questions about Smollett?” Media Research Center‘s contributing editor, Mark Finkelstein, asked.

Finkelstein argued that the show’s co-hosts should have “let Rahm explain live on the air his refusal to answer” or they should have canceled the interview.

“Instead, Joe and Mika did neither. Had they bowed meekly to Emanuel’s demand?” he asked.

“Looks like the fix was in,” Finkelstein wrote, noting how MSNBC correspondent Kasie Hunt and New York Times reporter Nick Confessore as well as other panel guests did not broach the subject with Emanuel either.

No one even questioned an widely reported interview Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson did with “Good Morning America” on Monday in which he said there was reportedly “a lot more evidence” indicating that Smollett staged his own hate crime.

Johnson had already leveled a blistering statement about Smollett in a press conference after the actor turned himself last week. Emanuel had followed that with a statement of his own at the time.

“All across Chicago, in every neighborhood, there are signs in front yards and windows that read, ‘Hate Has No Home Here.’ It is a sign that expresses our shared values and defines our great city,” Emanuel said. “Our laws exist to reflect and defend those values, and hate crimes will never be tolerated.”

“A single individual who put their perceived self-interest ahead of these shared principles will never trump Chicago’s collective spirit,” he added.

Meanwhile, MSNBC’s obvious omission was not lost on Twitter users who slammed the network for its move.

The Nigerian brothers who police claim helped orchestrate the “attack” last month in Chicago reportedly made homophobic statements on Twitter that some believe could be used in the singer’s defense.

As reported by The Daily Mail, tweets from an account used by brothers Ola Osundairo, and Abel Osundairo surfaced on Monday with Ola writing to a man in 2013: “Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right,” according to The Blast.

Another tweet read: “YOU’RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.” It’s unclear who Ola was referring to in that tweet, the report states.

Smollett’s defense team may be able to use these posts to support the Empire star’s claim that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck.

The offensive tweets contradict statements the brothers previously made publicly after being interrogated by the police.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they said in a joint statement.

Smollett charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime. Smollett, who had to surrender his passport, is free to travel only to New York and California to meet with his legal team, Page Six reports.

Meanwhile, Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson claims the singer paid the brothers $3500 to participate in the elaborate hoax because he was upset with his Empire salary.

Chief Johnson went on GMA yesterday to elaborate on the investigation and defend its notoriously brutal police force.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Smollett’s lawyers released a statement after the Empire star was charged: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”"

According to sources, the topic had never come up.

It was Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson who initially floated the idea that the actor was looking increase the size of his bag. However, how he came to this particular conclusion is still unknown. Also worth noting, even the FBI has said Chicago PD needs to slow its roll.

TMZ reports that multiple sources say the executive producers and producers of the show had no inkling that Smollett was seeking more money.

Reportedly, Smollett was making $125,000 per episode. Which is not bad considering the show’s headliners (Taraji P. Henson, Terrence Howard) bring in about $250,000 per episode.

But since his arrest, Smollett was reportedly written out of the final two episodes of the season. The struggle is real.

The two Nigerian-American brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, claimed the “Empire” actor staged the attack. They also maintained they were not homophobic or anti-Trump. However, homophobic tweets from them have now surfaced.

See Also: Complete Timeline Of Jussie Smollett Investigation

The Blast reports, Ola Osundairo posted on Twitter in 2013, “Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right.” Another message read, “YOU’RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.” Ola also once wrote, “I don’t follow any man. I follow woman.”

When this case goes to trial, these tweets will certainly come up considering they said in public statements, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Earlier this week, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

""Jussie Smollett You will die black fag"" Okay, I'm ready to fight. pic.twitter.com/h42Px47lvW — ℝ𝕚𝕔𝕙 ℍ𝕠𝕞𝕠 ℚ𝕦𝕒𝕟 (@Homiekage) January 29, 2019

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

Additionally, Chicago Police allegedly Smollet staged the attack because he wanted a higher salary. But TMZ also says, “None of the brass — producers or EPs, including Lee Daniels — heard even a whisper from Jussie grousing he was underpaid” and “Jussie was pulling in a reported $125,000 per episode. We’re told that’s on par with actor Bryshere Y. Gray, who plays his brother, Hakeem. Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard reportedly make $250,000 an episode.”

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett has denied all allegations he staged the attack.

Never mind Wednesday’s public congressional hearing featuring Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, or special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report on possible conspiracy involving Russia, Trump’s 2016 campaign and his post-inaugural administration. Forget a virtual life sentence for his campaign manager Paul Manafort, or The Donald’s political sidekick Roger Stone’s struggle to comply with a new gag order while awaiting trial on charges of linking Wikileaks to Trump’s campaign. Put aside, for now, even federal court rulings on the president’s declaration of a national emergency because Congress declined to fund a border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for.

What concerns me right now are, other than giveaways Trump might surrender to Kim in quest of a Nobel Peace Prize nomination, are three startling issues the president has chosen to ignore or dismiss as he flies to Hanoi:

1). After Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson of Silver Spring was arrested for stockpiling weapons and drugs while displaying threats on his workplace computer to assassinate Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, four Democratic presidential candidates and journalists for MSNBC and CNN notably critical of Trump, the president’s near silence has been thunderous and entirely predictable.

But what about Republican congressional leaders? Where’s the collegial support Democrats showed GOP Rep. Steve Scalise when he was shot by a liberal-leaning gunman during softball practice? Can you imagine the Trump tweet storm had the native-born Coast Guard officer been an illegal Muslim or Latino immigrant? Or even a legal one? Trump has next to nothing to say about this arrest, not even a shout-out to law-enforcement officers who thwarted a potential domestic assault on democracy. Yet he’s found time to tweet about actor Jussie Smollett’s truly fake hate-crime accusation.

2). Hillary Clinton’s popular-vote “victory” over Trump, of course, was pyrrhic: The Electoral College rules. But it annoyed Trump enough that he claimed with no evidence that three to five million illegal aliens from south of the border voted for Hillary. He even appointed a commission to investigate widespread voter fraud, which fizzled because states refused to cooperate in what they deemed a charade. Now we have proof, not of voter fraud but election fraud, so patently illegal that North Carolina ordered a do-over in the Ninth Congressional District.

This hasn’t happened in four decades. Mishandling of absentee ballots exclusively on behalf of the Republican candidate was too blatant to survive scrutiny. The “winner” of the now-discredited November election likely won’t run for “re-election.” But Trump is tweet-less regarding Republican fraud. If you think he’d spare a Democratic cheater, then you’d believe Vladimir Putin’s assurance that North Korea has no missiles that could reach the U.S.

3). When Alex Acosta was nominated for Secretary of Labor his role in the sweetheart deal that let serial child-rapist/sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein get away with a sentence of 13 months in Palm Beach County jail was a matter of public record. Mostly Epstein just slept behind bars with his days spent in work release—maybe at bars. Cursory vetting would’ve revealed this travesty of justice. But #metoo and Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown (fake news, Mr. President?) caught up with the billionaire financier’s obscene perfidy. Epstein directed girls he’d raped to recruit other girls for his abuse and that of well-heeled rapist buddies. Epstein was caught in Palm Beach, but his sex-traffic map extended to New York, New Mexico, his private Virgin Islands isle and Europe. Why then-U.S. attorney Acosta apparently violated the law by not informing victims of his Epstein deal is one question.

But another is why Trump gave Acosta a pass and remains aloof regarding the rich sex trafficker his cabinet enabler protected. Or why the president is thumb-silent about longtime supporter Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, charged with solicitation in a sex-trafficking ring that imprisoned Chinese girls in a south Florida massage parlor. If sex-trafficking is such a national emergency, why not wall off Florida instead of the Rio Grande? Let’s guess Trump’s tweet: “Wall stops crime and sin but would block my view @Palm Beach.”

Meanwhile, good luck in Vietnam, Mr. President. You’ll need it. So will we. Does anybody take notes?

Yahoo News

DETROIT —When Nikki Joly’s Jackson home burned down in 2017, some thought the fire was a hate crime against the transgendered, gay-rights activist who had fought for a local anti-discrimination ordinance.

But now, instead of a victim, the 54-year-old is accused of being the perpetrator.

The Michigan case is gaining national attention alongside the situation involving Jussie Smollett, another alleged hate crime victim who became the accused. Authorities concluded the attack on Smollett was a hoax.

“Real hate crimes are on the rise,” Graham Cassano, associate professor of sociology at Michigan’s Oakland University, said Monday. “But, as these crimes increase and become publicized, it’s not surprising to me that people would take the opportunity to use this to their advantage and fabricate hate crimes.”

Authorities accuse Joly of setting fire to his own home and killing his pets, two dogs and three cats. He has been charged with first-degree arson, and a hearing has been set for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over, what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

Two cases with unexpected twists

Initially, some in the community perceived the blaze to be a hate crime, Hitt said. Investigators considered that, too, but ruled out the possibility as evidence that pointed to Joly came to light.

Declining to offer a motive for the house fire, Hitt acknowledged that some in Jackson were probably rattled — perhaps in a similar way to the Smollett case — by the police investigation’s unexpected outcome and charge. Joly was named 2018’s Citizen of the Year by the Jackson’s newspaper, the Citizen Patriot.

In the higher-profile hate crime case that turned on its head last week, Smollett, a 36-year-old actor on the drama TV series “Empire,” alleged to Chicago police he had been a victim. Smollett was arrested on charges that he set up the assault.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said masked men yelled racial slurs, attacked him, put a rope around his neck and made references to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

But, Chicago police said, their investigation found evidence that Smollett staged the crime, possibly to portray himself as a victim and boost his salary as an actor, and lied to police.

Tearing up at the thought of his dogs

Joly, a transgender man, was touted as Jackon’s 2018 citizen of the year by the local newspaper and described as an activist who had endured slights and still re-energized a movement.

He tried to “pass an ordinance in Jackson protecting people against discrimination because they are gay, because they are transgender, because they aren’t as some say they should be,” according to the newspaper.

The long profile described the Detroit native as someone who had been on his own since his adoptive parents ousted him at 15, had been sexually assaulted, and subjected to “insulting gender questions” and “refused service in bars or restaurants.”

Joly, the article said, was “born female,” but “prefers a masculine pronoun,” and has long “been activist-minded even if it was not always openly.”

It also mentioned the fire on Aug. 10, 2017, in which his home was burned down.

In the profile, Joly said that he was “really in shock for quite a while.” He teared at the thought of his dogs, who perished in the blaze, the article said, and organized a weapons training course at a gun range to fight fear.

A few months later, Joly was charged with setting the fire.

Terrible for those ‘facing real hate crimes’

In the Joly case, police suspicion was based on a timeline of events, phone records, physical evidence and witness statements. Joly had the “means and opportunity to start the fire,” according to a report published by Mlive.com in October.

Security camera video showed Joly filling a gas can before the fire, the Mive article said. Gasoline was on his clothing, per the report, and a witness smelled gas on him. Photographs seemed to be missing from the walls, and Joly received $50,000 in donations after the fire.

Joly’s attorney, Andrew Abood, challenged the police conclusion.

“What they have is a coincidence and a coincidence is not proof beyond reasonable doubt,” Abood said, per Mlive. “They are trying to convict on circumstantial evidence and theory when they have no direct evidence in the case.”

Still, Cassano said, when presumed victims of hate crimes are actually the perpetrators, “it’s terrible for social movements in general” and terrible, specifically, for people “facing real hate crimes.”

In 2018 alone, the civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Campaign, tracked 26 deaths of transgender people in the U.S. as a result of fatal violence. So far this year, the group identified one death.

The most recent stats from the FBI showed 7,106 hate crimes in 2017, up 17 percent from the year before. Of those crimes, nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of race and ethnicity and nearly 16 percent because of sexual orientation.

“When someone comes along and fabricates a hate crime, it calls into question people who have really experience these things,” Cassano said. “It’s absolutely awful. It really, to my mind, is incomprehensible.”

Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor of political science at Kentucky State University in Frankfort who has studied fake hate crimes, wrote that the fact that Smollett’s case is being alleged a hoax “shouldn’t surprise anyone.”

Reiley didn’t mention the Joly case but made the case in an opinion piece for USA Todayand a book “Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War,” that “a great many hate crime stories turn out to be hoaxes.”

The professor said he found more than 400 confirmed hate hoaxes, and he concluded that “what hate hoaxers actually do is worsen generally good race relations, and distract attention from real problems.”

The fire killed five pets and the FBI investigated it as a hate crime, according to the Detroit News.

Law enforcement later arrested Nikki Joly, accusing him of setting fire to the house. Traces of gasoline were found in several rooms in the home.



(Jackson Police Department)

In the months before the house went up in flames, Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, planned a pride parade, and helped push through a nondiscrimination ordnance. He was named citizen of the year by a local paper.

Two of Joly’s colleagues told police that he had been frustrated that the pride parade did not receive more recognition and that the attention on gay rights was loosing steam after the passage of the nondiscrimination law.

One of the colleagues later denied to the news outlet that she told police “anything like that.”

Joly’s attorney denies he was looking for more attention.

Joly told police on the morning of the fire he bought fuel at a gas station to mow the lawn. When it became too hot to mow, he went into work and later got a call from his girlfriend that she had forgotten her lunch. Joly went home to get her lunch, and minutes after he left, the home was on fire.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being scene [sic],” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the police report.

A hearing on the case has been scheduled for March 8.

The case is developing soon after an actor on the show ""Empire,"" Jussie Smollett, is being accused of staging a hate crime against himself. Smollett is suspected of hiring two of his friends to attack him and put a rope around his neck."

She thought she would soon marry a man she adored, a welcome change after the messy and bitter divorce that ultimately cost her former husband his job as a speechwriter for President Trump.

Then some unwelcome news arrived from a courtroom on Cape Cod: A Massachusetts judge had ruled a $4 million defamation lawsuit filed against her last April by her ex-husband, David Sorensen, would be allowed to go to trial.

With a court battle looming, Corbett said, her fiance’s family wanted the couple to hit the brakes on the wedding. Feeling awful, she agreed.

Soon after, Corbett climbed into the bathtub in the Portland apartment she and her fiance shared and came down with what she called a panic attack.

“It all came to a head and I snapped,” Corbett said Monday. “I tried to kill myself. I took a whole lot of pills.”

For Corbett, 33, it was just one more moment in her long odyssey to escape a bad marriage and slip away from Sorensen for good. Had she followed the “silent underground railroad” that many women in her shoes take, she said, perhaps it would have gone better.

But when she chose to tell The Washington Post a year ago about her life with Sorensen, he quickly lost his White House position and began a public effort to clear his name by accusing Corbett of lying about their 2½-year marriage. During their time together, Sorensen served as a top aide to former Gov. Paul LePage while Corbett held a series of political positions.

Sorensen has repeatedly – and steadfastly – denied he was ever violent toward Corbett. Their rocky marriage, which included her throwing a diamond ring at him, ended in divorce in 2016.

“I have never been violent in any way toward any woman in my entire life,” Sorensen said Monday. “The thought of it disgusts me.”

For both of them, though, the trauma continues. Sorensen apparently hopes winning a defamation lawsuit will clear his name, while Corbett insists she already has lost everything but will not renounce the truth of their relationship.

Their split, Corbett said, “forced me to give up my life as I knew it,” leaving behind the political world in Augusta and most of the mutual friends she and Sorensen shared.

But when she found new love and got engaged at Christmas 2017, she thought she had moved past the trauma and hurt – until she had to call off wedding last July.

When Corbett gulped down pills three days before she had planned to wed, her fiance called 911 and sent her off to the hospital, where doctors kept her on a suicide watch and made sure she pulled through.

In the morning, physicians said she could go home. She phoned her fiance, who had promised to return to bring her home.

“I gotta go,” he told her before hanging up.

When the hospital released Corbett, she was surprised he was not there. So she took her purse, “just reeling and stunned,” and began walking home. Before too long, she thought to call an Uber.

When she arrived at their apartment, she immediately noticed that only one of two pairs of Bean boots sat outside the door. Inside, one dog barked – hers.

At that moment, “my heart shattered,” Corbett said.

“It was like the glass slipper broke,” Corbett said, her Cinderella period shattered for good.

When she finally got inside, she found he had taken all of his stuff and left. She never heard from him directly again.

Sorensen said he is “glad to learn her fiance escaped before she inflicted permanent damage on his life like she did on mine.

“Her life will improve only when she gets the help even her best friends say she needs, and when she stops seeking the attention she craves,” he said.

Corbett said that after the wedding fell through, she felt alone, but soon realized she was not.

Corbett said her friends in the neighborhood rallied to help, making sure she did not just spend her days crying. They got her food. They got her moving.

They helped find her a new apartment that turned out to be on her favorite block along Morning Street, where she had always hoped to live. They hired her to clean houses and Airbnb apartments.

“This community has been very kind to me,” Corbett said, reeling off the names of at least a dozen people who went out of their way to provide support when she was “hanging by a thread.”

But she had seen many others in far worse shape when she was volunteering at The Root Cellar, a privately funded community center that lends a hand to people in the area surrounding it on Washington Avenue. It helped her find perspective on her own woes.

Since last spring, Corbett has tried to stay out of the public eye, not venturing onto social media because she was sick of dealing with the trolls and feeling rattled from the constant pressure.

Then she learned Patrisha McLean, former wife of famed singer Don McLean, was creating an exhibition about domestic violence.

Inspired my McLean and fueled by “a puddle of tears,” Corbett said she decided to write up a brief account of her “life as it is today, laid bare” in a series of comments on Twitter last week.

At the end of that thread, she invited readers to donate to her legal defense fund, hoping she might raise a couple thousand dollars to fight Sorensen’s lawsuit.

Sorensen said Corbett “is turning to political activist strangers for help because people who know her don’t believe her. She is the female Jussie Smollett,” the actor who allegedly faked a racial attack in Chicago recently.

Corbett’s fundraiser did better than she expected.

By Monday afternoon, her post had been retweeted almost 5,000 times, including by some celebrities, and more than 700 people had chipped in more than $27,000, including Patrisha McLean.

Now, she said, she can defend herself in court and, with luck, fend off Sorensen’s case.

“He’s taken so much from me,” Corbett said. “He cannot take the truth.”

“There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told Robin Roberts of ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened,” he added.

Smollett is accused of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. The 36-year-old allegedly paid two brothers to feign an attack on him, which the gay and black actor said was motivated by racial hatred and homophobia from Trump supporters.

Smollett paid a pair of Nigerian brothers to carry out an alleged hoax with a check for $3,500, the memo line of which said, “5 Week Nutrition/Workout Program Don’t Go,” as TMZ noted.

Los Angeles: The Oscars celebrated diversity with a string of wins for minority nominees, but the night's message was undermined by a bitter controversy simmering Monday over the best picture winner, civil rights dramedy ‘Green Book.’

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist, who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when ‘Driving Miss Daisy,’ a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded ‘Do the Right Thing’ couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with ‘BlacKkKlansman’ and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""I'm snakebit, every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize, an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee, after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election, took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

The top prize, the third statuette of the night for 'Green Book', came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor. The film, an audience favourite that has taken more than USD 140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white saviour movie."" Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster ""Black Panther,"" a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for ""Black Panther.""

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" ""Green Book"" proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the ""well-intentioned white/black balance"" came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its ""relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.""

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown's liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in ""Green Book"" as ""noble."" Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

""Saying movies like 'Green Book' make white movie goers feel better is insulting,"" said editor Christian Toto. ""Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one's bigotry?""

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 per cent in 2016 to 19.8 per cent in 2017, a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless. ""It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,"" said Toto."

Answer: A heck of a lot.

Now let's start with Spike Lee. The iconic director is worth millions. I mean, he's made millions, he's done really well. Over 30 years, though, he's been nominated no fewer than five times for an Academy award. Until Sunday night, he had never won an Oscar. He took home the award for adapting the screenplay for his movie ""BlacKkKlansman. ""

But rather than showing humility and gratitude, he spiked the moment with a tiresome political diatribe that he fumbled.

""The 2020 Presidential election is around the corner. Let's all - let's all be on the right side of history,"" he said. ""Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing. You know, I had to get that in there.""



Number one: Lame that after all these years, he couldn't memorize his lines. Number two: Lame that he couldn't accept the honor without gratuitous cursing, which you couldn't even hear because the Oscars had to bleep him. Number three: Disagreeing with your political vision, Spike, doesn't make you immoral or a bad person.

Well, like I've said before, liberals are angry sometimes even when they should be happy. And most are off-the-charts intolerant and judgmental of people who don't think like they do. And Lee, just like in his latest film, suffers from kind of a deficit of both subtlety and grace.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

Perhaps not surprisingly, President Trump couldn't resist lobbing a post-Oscars response, tweeting, ""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African-Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts, etc.) than almost any other Pres!""

Well, beyond the politics what should not have been a part of Hollywood's big night anyway, Spike Lee's performance lacks some grace. I think, to regular people, he just came across as kind of bratty, rude, self-absorbed, egotist, masquerading, though, as a brilliant social justice warrior. The old Spike Lee -- got to go back like 30-35 years -- was at least kind of cutting edge.

Like most of today's social justice warriors, AOC truly believes she is always morally right. And that notion entitles her to be one of the leaders of not the #MeToo movement, but the ""Me-me-me"" movement. She's been on the job for exactly two months and you would swear her Green New Deal is a second Declaration of Independence.

This craziness goes way beyond Spike Lee. It's the same arrogant, self-important thinking that propelled ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett into believing he could stage an anti-MAGA hoax and then conclude that he emerges a hero. Making a scene and casting yourself as a wounded martyr is what these elites do best. You see, when you're on the right side of history, it's your duty to start a national conversation and inject yourself in the middle of it. Facts? They're irrelevant, kind of passe. The famed political philosopher Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once observed, ""There's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct in about being morally right.""

Well, like most of today's social justice warriors, AOC truly believes she is always morally right. And that notion entitles her to be one of the leaders of not the #MeToo movement, but the ""Me-me-me"" movement. She's been on the job for exactly two months and you would swear her Green New Deal is a second Declaration of Independence.

""I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago and it's creating all of this conversation,"" AOC said recently. ""Why? Because no one else has even tried. So people are, like, oh, it's unrealistic. Oh, it's vague. Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing. and I'm, like, you try. You do it. Because you're not. Because you're not. So until you do it, I'm the boss. How about that?""

I know you didn't. I mean, she's like, 25-29 years old, and she's, like, the boss of Congress. And it's, like, totally -- it must be nice.

But what she lacks in experience, she's excited. It's kind of good she's in there, in the mix. She lacks kind of its perspective, too. She makes up for all of it in ego and confidence, got to give her that.

Well, Ocasio-Cortez's allergy to protocol, combined with her ""I want it now"" mentality is a by-product of the ""everyone gets a trophy"" era in which she was raised. Where coddled kids grow up to be entitled adults.

Who needs manners and decorum when you've just been rewarded for speaking your truth? You always have to hit your chest when you say you're speaking your truth, whenever and wherever you want. When adults indulge youngsters, we get shallow thinkers. And by the way, this entire notion of speaking your truth is goofy because it presupposes that there really is no objective truth.

Your truth isn't necessarily the truth, and it's probably just your opinion. And you're entitled to have it. But until you've lived, fallen and failed, it's probably fairly uninformed, even if it's entertaining and highly energetic. You're entitled to speak all you'd like, of course --it's the First Amendment. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, but no one is obligated to listen to you.



And whether you're an overrated director or minor TV actor or Vogue's congressional ""It"" girl, none of it matters. And that goes, by the way, for rude middle school and high school students who are coached to get in the face of adults on Capitol Hill and just like talk to them like they are the contemporaries or Instagram buddies.

What am I talking about? Well on Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein was confronted by a group of AOC mini-mes lobbying for the Green New Deal match in her office. This may have been Feinstein's finest hour. She was forced to deal with immature, militant activists that her party is churning out by the thousands -- activists who usually confront and then try to embarrass Republicans.



Again, the blame isn't with the kids; they're students. It's with their parents and teachers. Let's face it, if there were no cell phones recording every word, how many would have even been there? So many people today, they crave attention. They want to have their moment. I understand.

And Spike Lee and AOC and these activist tots should take note: Making a scene and posting it on social media may feel good but it's no substitute for accomplishment or hard work. Whether you're a liberal or conservative or something in between, just try listening to the opposing view, then sharpening your arguments.



No matter how much you virtue-signal, harassing people isn't a talent. It's just lazy. And in the end, lazy is just boring. and it rarely wins.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor staged the attack to look like a hate crime, to take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career... because he was dissatisfied with his salary.”

Smollett has insisted he is innocent, and appears to have some support from fellow cast members, although he has been written out of the rest of the current series, with his lawyers saying the presumption of innocence has been “trampled upon” in his case. They added that Smollett, who has been on the Empire cast since 2015, “is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

TMZ now reports that execs are doubting the motive given by police, saying Smollett never complained about his salary, and that no producers “heard even a whisper from Jussie grousing he was underpaid.”

Smollett was in the middle of a long-term contract and was pulling in a reported $125,000 per episode.

TMZ adds that Smollett’s “main focus” recently had been music, saying he was “upset his first album didn’t do well and was stressed out over the debuts of his new songs and music videos.”

Smollett is facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was released from custody after posting a $10,000 bond last week.

Smollett, who is gay, told investigators he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him.

He also told investigators that the men who attacked yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

It has been reported that he wrote a $3,500 check to Abel Osundairo, a close friend who is accused, with his brother, of having carried out the phony attack."

In two recent why-dunits, the curious have wondered why: (1) a successful TV star would allegedly orchestrate a fake, hate-inspired attack on himself, and (2) a Coast Guard officer would allegedly plot a mass-murder attack on American Democrats and journalists.

In the first instance, prosecutors say that actor Jussie Smollett last month paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack, tie a noose around his neck, douse him with bleach, and shout, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor, who is gay, and his alleged pretend-assailants, are all black. But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired — by Smollett.





If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged for disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a Ronald Reagan phrase that was commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag is in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed — at least by many in the pitchfork media — because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

Yet, a more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay — and in the name of Donald Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, last week, a California high-school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

On a far-more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested last week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people — and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion — it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, yet the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated three-decade military servicemember, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court yet never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grownups are so upset about it.

The contest is ""wide open,"" as Reuters puts it, with 14 candidates competing in the officially nonpartisan ""jungle primary"" that will lead to a runoff between the top two candidates if nobody gets 50% plus one vote. Polling indicates that is very probable:

[William] Daley [brother and son of former mayors Daley and former Obama WH chief of staff], former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle lead the crowded field with 14 percent each, according to a poll published Sunday by 270 Strategies. They are trailed closely by three other candidates: Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza (10 percent), former Chicago School Board President Gery Chico (9 percent) and businessman Willie Wilson (9 percent).

Chicago voters are in turmoil over the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax, as well as continuing revulsion over the 2014 police shooting of Laquan McDonald. Video of Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting him 16 times was suppressed by the Emanuel administration, only to be released and result in Van Dyke's conviction last October.

The Chicago Tribune has profiles of each of the 14 candidates, but the result that seems likely — and which worries me and many others — is that Bill Daley and Toni Preckwinkle will be the top two and will run against each other in an election that will racially polarize the city, with African-American Preckwinkle and white-Irish Daley at odds with each other. Both are Democrats, of course. Preckwinkle was behind the soda tax fiasco.

University of Chicago political science professor Charles Lipson has a must-read article in the U.K. Spectator's American edition. He provides essential background necessary for understanding any mayoral election in Chicago, and on the ongoing federal investigation of political corruption in Chicago that had the most powerful alderman, Ed Burke, wearing a wire for two years. Tick, tick, tick...some time bombs are going to explode under the political establishment, in other words.

On Preckwinkle, he writes:

Until recently, everyone expected Toni Preckwinkle to win, going away. She rose through the reform movement and now heads of the county government. She's experienced, likable, and well-funded. But she also has an 'Ed Burke problem.' He held a very successful fundraiser for her. Not that there's any connection, mind you, but she hired his son for a $100,000+ job and admitted she spoke to the elder Burke before making the hire. Toni has strong backing from the AFSCME public-sector union and the Chicago Teachers Union, which is determined to squash the city's large charter school program. While many voters still favor her, others worry about insider deals and whether she can tackle the city's financial problems and continue its school reforms, which would pit her against her strongest supporters.

Daley is presumed to have the machine clout necessary to be the other candidate in the runoff. Lipson explains how this works.

None of the candidates will be stellar, and none has the ability to reverse the death spiral of municipal finance under the rapidly escalating burden of excessive pension payments.

If the crimes aren’t being reported then how would you know?

If those crimes are going unreported then nobody has any idea how many take place. If you’ve got a number then someone is keeping a count. What’s shocking is I haven’t heard any of the conservative panelists ask a simple question: “If the crimes aren’t being reported then how would you know?”

This is right up there with the phrase, “Diversity makes us stronger!” When you consider the threats from non-native species at Yellowstone Park or imported Japanese Yew in Ketchum you could argue diversity is a threat.

The reactions of many on the left to the case of Jussie Smollett prove two important things:

There is little racism in America. The left — white and black — is morally and psychologically impaired.

There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollet faked the “racist” attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, “I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created….”

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been “an atmosphere of menace and hate” since Donald Trump was elected president, which made “people want to believe” Smollett’s story. Exactly. Capehart a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: “I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did.” Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling “This is MAGA country” beat up blacks.

Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, “I wanted to be wrong.” Three paragraphs later: “But still, I wanted to be wrong.”

This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.

Here’s the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church? Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?

As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews — certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews — would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.

Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?

Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.

And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history — namely, that America is a racist country. If just one 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, “You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),” that would end the Democrats’ chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens — and in the least-racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history — want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.

And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?

Lee (pictured above right) won his first Oscar during Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony for Best Adapted Screenplay. Lee has directed films for more than 30 years; many people believed he was overdue for recognition at the Oscars. He ultimately won for the film, “BlacKkKlansman.”

But Lee brought politics into his victory speech when he pointedly reminded Hollywood that “the 2020 presidential election is around the corner.”

“Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing,” Lee said, reading from a script.

Ingraham said on Monday night, “Rather than showing humility or gratitude, he ‘spiked’ the moment with a tiresome political diatribe.”

“Like I’ve said before, liberals are angry sometimes even when they should be happy. And most are off-the-charts intolerant and judgmental of people who don’t think like they do.” She added that Lee “suffers from kind of a deficit of both subtlety and grace.”

“It’s the same arrogant, self-important thinking that propelled ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett into believing he could stage an anti-MAGA hoax and then conclude that he emerges a hero,” Ingraham said. “Making a scene and casting yourself as the wounded martyr is what these elites do best.”

Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police last Thursday morning on suspicion of filing a false report and disorderly conduct. He was released later that day after paying $10,000 toward his bail.

The actor, who is gay and African-American, alleged that two white supporters of President Donald Trump attacked him on January 29. Smollett said they threw a noose around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

But Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a press conference last week that Smollett allegedly paid $3,500 to two Nigerian brothers who played extras on “Empire” to carry out the “attack” against him — because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

Ingraham also pointed to how Ocasio-Cortez (above left) exemplifies the “politics of me” through her own attitude of moral superiority in pushing her radical Green New Deal proposal to combat climate change.

“Like most of today’s social justice warriors, AOC truly believes she’s always morally right. And that notion entitles her to be one of the leaders of — not the #MeToo movement — but the Me Me Me movement,” Ingraham said. “She’s been on the job for exactly two months, and you would swear her Green New Deal is a second Declaration of Independence.”

Ocasio-Cortez raised some eyebrows on Friday when she suggested Democrats and Americans at large should listen to her because “I’m the boss” until politicians address climate change.

She made that remark during a Girls Who Code event in New York City.

“So people are like, ‘Oh it’s unrealistic. Oh it’s vague. Oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing,'” Ocasio-Cortez said as she characterized the criticism of her Green New Deal. “And I’m like, ‘You try. You do it. ‘Cause you’re not. ‘Cause you’re not. So, until you do it, I’m the boss.’ How about that?”

Iraq War veteran and political activist Leo Dunson told Ingraham on Monday night that Lee, in particular, is “part of the liberal elite” and was “able to stand up there in the front of the entire world and get multiple claps” for his antics and anti-Trump language “in front of a smug room of people who are all rich and famous.”

But attorney and legal analyst Monique Pressley argued that Lee “has had a 30-year career. He won an Oscar after those 30 years. He deserved it well before that. I think he gets to use his time [in] whatever way he wants to use his time.”

Ingraham countered that the U.S. is now dealing with “a generation that believes that if someone disagrees with you, they’re a bad person.”

The Heritage Foundation’s David Azerrad said Americans must emphasize unity, not identity. Unity, friendship, brotherhood and “the fact that we’re all Americans” are all worth celebrating, he argued.

“Don’t emphasize the divisiveness. Emphasize unity,” Azerrad said.

Pressley mostly agreed, saying, “So there doesn’t have to be the divisiveness.” She added, “We don’t have to embrace that in order to embrace the fact that there’s something good about me and the skin that I’m in” and more.

And why is that? Because the Left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history — namely, that America is a racist country. If just one of five black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, “You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),” that would end the Democrats’ chances of winning national elections. The Democratic party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens — and in the least-racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history — want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need to address at this time.

During the arraignment, prosecutors said Vieira met a 13-year-old boy in the summer of 2018 through a gay social media app called GRINDR. He agreed to meet the boy at Mount Vernon Park in Lawrence where a sex act is alleged to have taken place in a dark SUV.

Empire bosses aren’t buying accusations Jussie Smollett staged his attack because he was upset with his salary, it has been claimed.

The 36-year-old was hospitalised after claiming to have been beaten and abused by two strangers in MAGA hats, who poured unknown chemicals on him and tied a noose around his neck in what was thought to be a hate crime.

However, Jussie has since been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report on 29 January, with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accusing the actor of staging the controversy to increase his pay packet.

According to TMZ, sources from Empire have debunked any suggestion Jussie was unhappy with his wage, and never once asked for a pay rise. He was already making a reported $125,000 (£95,000) per episode, while his co-stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard are said to take home $250,000 (£187,000) each instalment.

Empire has since pulled Jussie – who has starred as Jamal Lyon on the series since 2015 – from the final two episodes of the current season.

In a statement released to the press, the Fox network stated: ‘The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us.

‘Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

‘While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

‘We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season.’

Regardless, Jussie’s cast mates have thrown their full support behind the actor, with Terrence posting a video of his co-star in the early hours of Sunday morning, adding the caption: ‘All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.’

The video shows Jussie playing with Terrence’s youngest son, tickling the tot and hysterically laughing as the child wriggles around.

He is due to appear in court on 16 March.

And I hope authorities in Chicago throw the book at him, because the lies he is accused of telling will likely bring great harm to innocent victims.

Smollett’s arrest Thursday for allegedly filing a false police report came as no surprise. His improbable tale — he said he was accosted last month by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, beat him up, put a noose around his neck and doused him with bleach, with one of the men saying that “this is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country” — sounded like a page from the first draft of a rejected screenplay.

Real life doesn’t happen that way. Actual white supremacists and homophobes don’t stroll through the streets of Chicago on a bitterly cold night, carrying a hate-crimes kit of rope and Clorox, hoping to chance upon someone who is black, gay and modestly famous. They don’t hurl perfectly scripted insults. They don’t vanish without a trace.

The minute I heard Smollett’s story, I suspected it would eventually fall apart — and I feared the potential consequences for genuine victims of genuine hate crimes.

Smollett was arrested just one day after federal authorities released evidence of the kind of grave threat that really does exist. They announced the arrest of Christopher Hasson, a 49-year-old U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist, for allegedly amassing a deadly arsenal in his Silver Spring, Md., home and planning to assassinate a list of public officials and journalists, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.

The menace of such white-supremacist terrorism is real and growing. Debacles such as Smollett’s apparent hoax do nothing but provide excuses to ignore the threat.

Were the news media too credulous in their initial reporting about Smollett’s claim? Not necessarily. A well-known person reported being assaulted, and Chicago police said they were taking his story seriously. Smollett had suffered some minor injuries and been treated at a hospital. I don’t know what reporters were supposed to do except report the facts as far as they were known — absent concrete evidence that those facts were actually fabrications.

Police now say that the scratches on Smollett’s face were self-inflicted and that he paid two men $3,500 to rough him up — gently — so he could become more famous and demand more money for his role in the Fox television series “Empire.” But nobody knew that at first. When new facts gradually emerged that cast doubt on Smollett’s account, those facts were reported.

I also don’t blame the fellow “Empire” cast members who stood by Smollett. It is only natural to want to support a friend and colleague who is in crisis.

But politicians who rushed to use Smollett’s account as a shocking sign of the times — Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., both called it an “attempted modern-day lynching,” for example — were foolish to do so. The story was shaky from the beginning, and a little early caution would have made unnecessary a lot of eventual backpedaling.

Was there, in general, an eagerness to believe Smollett because of the atmosphere President Donald Trump has created? Probably — and, I would argue, quite understandably.

According to the FBI, there were 7,175 hate-crime incidents in this country in 2017 — a big jump from 2016, when there were 6,121 such incidents. (Those figures surely minimize the real problem, since many jurisdictions do not report hate crimes to the FBI at all.) Regarding incidents in 2017 in which victims were targeted because of race, 2,013 attacks were against blacks versus 741 against whites. Of incidents in which victims were targeted because of religion, the vast majority were against Jews and Muslims. There were more than a thousand anti-LGBT incidents versus just 32 classified as anti-heterosexual.

No, Trump isn’t telling people to go out and commit hate crimes. But the white-supremacist lunatic who killed 11 innocent Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October was apparently motivated, somehow, by Trump’s apocalyptic rhetoric about illegal immigration. It’s not hard to see why, to some, Smollett’s story might have seemed plausible.

Trump didn’t actually put words in Smollett’s mouth, though. The actor allegedly made the decision to lie and should now face the consequences.

Police officials in Chicago, where the murder rate is out of control, had to waste time and resources on a wild goose chase. Even worse, the next victim of an actual hate crime might not be believed. By allegedly feigning injury to himself, Smollett grievously injured untold others.

In two recent why-dunits, the curious have wondered why: (1) a successful TV star would allegedly orchestrate a fake, hate-inspired attack on himself, and (2) a Coast Guard officer would allegedly plot a mass-murder attack on American Democrats and journalists.

ADVERTISING

In the first instance, prosecutors say that actor Jussie Smollett last month paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack, tie a noose around his neck, douse him with bleach, and shout, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor, who is gay, and his alleged pretend-assailants, are all black. But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired — by Smollett.

If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged for disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a Ronald Reagan phrase that was commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag is in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed — at least by many in the pitchfork media — because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

Yet, a more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay — and in the name of Donald Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, last week, a California high-school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

On a far-more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested last week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people — and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion — it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, yet the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated three-decade military servicemember, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court yet never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grownups are so upset about it.

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when Driving Miss Daisy, a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won best picture while his widely lauded Do the Right Thing couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for best film with BlacKkKlansman and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""I'm snakebit -- every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize -- an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee -- after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election -- took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

'Repellently obtuse'

The top prize -- the third statuette of the night for Green Book -- came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for best supporting actor.

The film, an audience favorite that has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white savior movie"".

Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster Black Panther, a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping three awards.

Three of the four acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for Black Panther.

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" Green Book proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

'Woke liberals'

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found that the ""well-intentioned white/black balance"" came across as glib, while the London-based Independent website bemoaned its ""relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity"".

As is often the case, there was a backlash to the backlash, from commentators complaining of an industry crippled by its fear of offending audiences and an obsession with the appearance of political correctness rather than genuine reform.

""No matter how woke you go it's never. good. enough,"" tweeted Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of online magazine Quillette.

Conservative entertainment blog Hollywood in Toto, which considers Tinseltown's liberals as something of a bete noire, described the bonding theme in Green Book as ""noble"".

""Saying movies like Green Book make white movie goers feel better is insulting,"" said editor Christian Toto. ""Why would you need to be white to enjoy a beautifully told story about moving past one's bigotry?""

Toto evoked the allegedly faked recent hate attack on black Empire actor Jussie Smollett to argue that the US movie industry is often too quick to see racism where none exists.

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published last week, noted that the ever-broadening landscape created by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services had ""created a tailwind"" for racial diversity.

The number of minority actors with lead roles in films increased from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 19.8 percent in 2017 -- a far from perfect statistic but a sizeable improvement, nonetheless.

""It sounds absurd to suggest people who claim to be against racism, like woke liberals in and out of Hollywood, would be against a film that promotes racial healing,"" said Toto."

Last week international reports claimed that Jussie allegedly ""staged"" the homophobic and racist attack in January because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"".

Trevor who joined the 'who's who' of Hollywood on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday night was asked for his opinion on the debacle.

""I process information as it comes to me. I don't jump to conclusions. What I have really appreciated is the conversation it has started around how dangerous it is as a member of the LGBTIQ community, whether or not Jussie's story is completely false or not,"" he said.

Since January 29, which was when Jussie first made the damning claims the story has taken a dramatic twist. Jussie has since been charged with a class four felony for falsifying a police report, handed himself over to the police to be arrested and posted $100,000 bail.

The Guardian reported that the actor also had to surrender his passport and that he's kept mum since the walls came crashing down around him.

Jussie's lawyers issued a statement saying the actor “enjoys the presumption of innocence”."

Reduce violent crime, maintain the mayor’s support, boost police morale, rebuild the shattered trust of the community and build a more transparent, accountable department.

Nearly three years later, the chief can tout some impressive crime drops. Last month had the lowest number of homicides in a January in nine years. And in 2018, overall crime in the city was down 10% since 2016.

It’s a lot of progress, Johnson told CNN’s Don Lemon Monday night. And he doesn’t want the Jussie Smollett case to overshadow those strides of improvement.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him, according to police. He also said one of the attackers put a rope around his neck, which a police spokesman said was shaped like a noose.

The “Empire” actor said one of the attackers said, “This MAGA country, n****r,” during the incident, police said.

But as the police investigation unfolded, Smollett went from hate crime victim to primary suspect.

And the Smollett case, Johnson said, could cause problems for a city that’s otherwise progressing.

‘We don’t want to lose that momentum’

Johnson said Monday he made a “pact” with the city’s mayor when he began leading the department that “we would do everything we could to make Chicago safer.”

“We’ve made a lot of progress in the past three years,” he said. “Crime is down, we have built up and repaired relationships in the black communities, the black and brown communities. So we don’t want to lose that momentum.”

And he said he doesn’t want “manufactured things” — like the “bogus police report” he says Smollett filed — to “stunt that growth.”

“The numbers are going the right way, the right direction,” he said. “That’s a good thing.”

“I don’t want anything to disrupt that (progress) unless it’s earned,” he said. “I just don’t understand the nature of something like this because it could really cause an issue in this city.”

Smollett initially said his attackers were ‘white-skinned’

The chief stood firm in saying that the evidence police uncovered later in the investigation did not corroborate Smollett’s initial description of the attack.

“Our job is to let the facts guide us to where we go,” Johnson said, adding that the actor initially said he saw through the attackers’ masks and reported they were “white-skinned people.”

“But the facts guided us in a different direction,” Johnson said. “I would tell you this also — we classified him as a victim. We gave him the benefit of the doubt all the way up to the 47th hour of the 48th hour that we could hold those two brothers in custody.”

Police say Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an attack on him. He faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct for falsely claiming he was attacked, police say. Johnson has said Smollett took “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Smollett has maintained he was truthful about the incident.

A statement on behalf of the actor called his bail hearing an “organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.”

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” the statement said.

Under Illinois law, filing a false police report is disorderly conduct and punishable by one to three years in prison. Smollett is due back in court March 14.

Authorities said Smollett was dissatisfied with his salary on the show and wanted publicity when he filed the police report.

Executive producers of “Empire” said last week that while they were waiting for the legal process to play out, they would remove Smollett’s character from the season’s final two episodes."

African Union Election Observation Mission observes opening, closing of polls and counting of votes in Nigerian Elections

On Saturday, February 23, 2019, the Nigerian Presidential and National Assembly elections held across Nigeria. Votes were cast, civic duties were fulfilled, people walked during a curfew, business thrived in VGC, Tiwa Savage slayed voting, stupidity led to the loss of lives, and fake news filled our stomachs with the lies of a mess.

It was a true election day; the fires of news turned to ash in the face of consumption. We lived it again, as some bemoaned the ‘good man’ that erstwhile Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was – whatever that means. To all these happenings, there was a constant, aided by the infinity of internet and electricity – if your EDC decided to not be Baba Sala.

Social media – especially Twitter ­– and to a lesser extent, Facebook served you the cuisine of news like a romantic partner; in the comfort of your bed and sometimes made you the judge of distilling authe news from the very fake news circulating the cyberspace.

While social media aided the circulation of news, one sometimes had to intellectually distill truth from bad. It was so bad that authentic news was passed off by yours truly because they seemed too authoritative in thick of sensitivity.

Social media, as the platform of election day-news, could not be trusted because propaganda constantly cohabits with truth online, thus mans had to stay en guarde. It was hard, it was tough – a spectator also had to assume the role of a judge and distillery to not become a propaganda machine by himself.

Heavy hitters like Google and Facebook, which play a key role in promoting news to the larger public continue to play that key role in shelving fake news, it has gotten increasingly high as modes of verification are harder than believing Jussie Smollett.

The bias of political affiliations took on a showcase as spectators looked on, while being unable to tell fact from lies. While a simple charge to ‘do better’ would be the go-to-guy in these situations, it is a cliche we have employed many-a-time only to see even men in high places become propaganda machines for cheap politicking.

It is a good watch for the average Nigerian in-the-know; for him to shake his head at the aggressive onslaught of politically inclined individuals to sway voters by hook or by crook. But for the average Nigerian without the ability to tell the difference, he feeds his gang at the newspaper stand a wad of lies he copped of social media.

This continues to harm truth in our country; the definition of truth continues to be warped, catering to the bias of spectators who take and believe their version of truth, sometimes at the expense of actual truth. The resulting harm this does is that people defend lies even with more lies.

The risk is not borne by the informed Nigerians, but by the millions of uninformed Nigerians. They then argue the actual truth when it comes along. In moments like this, one envies the Chinese principle that controls what circulates on the internet and even in media. Things like this are either too reduced a reality to happen or simply extinct as a matter of practice.

What we currently experience in Nigeria is a product of expression of Fundamental Rights – we can never call that a luxury, but what happens when we continue to abuse our freedom at the expense of what a nation deems overwhelming truth for our selfish ends? The power of collective responsibility guaranteed by the Constitution continually gets abused.

Do we not deserve these rights?

We actually deserve our rights. In fact, Fundamental Human Rights should simply be granted – it’s not a conversation of deserving or not deserving it. The right to express freely is God-given and natural.

All things are definitely prone to abuse, but when these rights are being abused for cheap lies and questionable ends, we have to draw a line.

Should the internet then be limited?

A while back, there were rumours that the freedom of Nigerians to express was going to be somehow limited by the government of the day and we rightly kicked up a fuss. After all, we do not live in communism.

With the way we’re going, one fears that we might soon exhaust our bandwidth of freedom of expression, but to every concept comes a disadvantage and this; what we currently witness with fake news on the internet is the downside of freedom of electronic expression.

While this downside is quite unsavoury, we must live with it and sleep with it. A limitation on our rights to express will be a problem long term as a people. What we must do now is again listen to the cliche – let us all be responsible with what we express as ‘fact’ on social media.

But that, my folks, is a long shot. There are no guarantees that this charge will work."

The victory for Peter Farrelly's true-life story of a gay black pianist who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his Italian-American driver in 1960s America lit up social media, sparking a savage backlash over what critics see as its ""whitesplaining"" racial politics.

Veteran African American filmmaker Spike Lee stormed briefly out of the auditorium as the top prize at the 91st Academy Awards was announced on Sunday, later hinting that he thought it was a historically poor choice.

Lee was dumbfounded back in 1990 when Driving Miss Daisy, a movie deemed by many to be egregiously tone deaf on race, won Best Picture while his widely lauded Do the Right Thing couldn't even muster a nomination.

Three decades later, Lee was in the running for Best Film with BlacKkKlansman and appeared exasperated to lose to another film about race relations set largely in a car.

""I'm snakebit – every time someone's driving someone, I lose,"" Lee half-joked backstage, visibly frustrated despite taking home a consolation prize – an Oscar for screenwriting, his first in a competitive category.

An evening overshadowed by a controversy over race had a fitting coda when Lee – after pleading for US voters to ""be on the right side of history"" when they vote in the 2020 presidential election – took a Twitter beating from Donald Trump.

""Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President,"" Trump tweeted Monday, although he hadn't been named by the director.

""Repellently obtuse""

The top prize – the 3rd statuette of the night for Green Book – came after its star Mahershala Ali, an African American and two years ago the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar, bagged the prize for Best Supporting Actor.

The film, an audience favorite that has taken more than $140 million in box offices worldwide, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere.

The real-life family of Ali's character, the late pianist Don Shirley, denounced the film as a ""symphony of lies"" while others described it as yet another ""white savior movie.""

Ali's co-star Viggo Mortensen was hardly a balm to the roiling controversy when, during a Q&A on the film in November, he used the N-word.

On the surface, the Academy's selections on Sunday looked about as diverse as could be expected, with superhero blockbuster Black Panther, a movie with a mainly black cast, scooping 3 awards.

Three of the 4 acting prizes went to African Americans and an Egyptian first-generation American, while black women won in costume design and production design for the first time, both for Black Panther.

Richard Brody argued in The New Yorker, however, that the ""repellently obtuse"" Green Book proved the academy had changed nothing meaningful since being berated over the 2016-17 #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

It's rarely known in an instant, or in 140 characters. Truth needs time to emerge, and patience from all of us to let that happen. The outrageous case of Jussie Smollett is just the latest proof of something we humans know well but keep forgetting.

Smollett, a black and openly gay actor on the TV show ""Empire,"" reported that he was the victim of an ugly hate crime three weeks ago. Now Chicago police say he made it up. They charged him Thursday with disorderly conduct for falsely describing an attack by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck. Police say he paid the men to stage the attack, to draw attention to himself because he wasn't happy about his salary on the hit series.

Smollett's actions were troubling. Visibly angered Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, said, ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American, use the symbolism of a noose ... to further his own public profile?"" But some initial reactions to Smollett's accusation, including by some political leaders, were also alarming. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris accepted Smollett's story. Harris tweeted that the alleged attack was an ""attempted modern day lynching."" A former prosecutor, Harris should know better.

The filing of charges doesn't prove or disprove the wisdom of snap judgments attacking or supporting Smollett. Either way, they were ill-advised. But the moral of this debacle is more than a bromide about not rushing to judgment. It fits in a larger narrative that's poisoning our country. And if we don't learn from what's happening, we're doomed.

Ours is an age in which words don't seem to matter. They can't be trusted because they often are false. As it becomes more difficult to determine what's real and what's not, we divide ourselves by what we believe to be true. This didn't happen overnight. The virus infected us years ago. And the institutions that are supposed to keep us from fragmenting – religious, media, governmental – are not trusted or valued as they once were, either, after withering attacks on their credibility or irrelevance to people's lives. The spread of social media has been rocket fuel for this fire. Now we are so quick to believe or disbelieve, so quick to accuse or defend, so quick to pick a side and inflame a situation. And truth grows ever more fragile.

We must de-escalate. We must re-establish the norms that guide conduct. We need to rebuild our institutions, but better; some need fixes, some overhauls. And we must relearn the lesson that news, like science, is provisional. It builds upon itself as facts are gathered, and that takes time. What's understood today might not be true tomorrow.

American history is filled with incredible claims, some proved true, some hoaxes. Wrenching stories of abuse, even before the #MeToo era, invite us to pass judgment. Leaks from unidentified sources offer glimpses at purported crimes and exonerations. Chicago police investigated Jussie Smollett's story for more than three weeks. It was a long process, and that process revealed a contradictory and more complicated set of facts. Let's trust that truth, and remember that the next time we're tempted to quickly pick a side.

Nikki Joly has been charged with first-degree arson for burning the Jackson, Michigan, house he rented to the ground, as well as two counts of animal killing related to the deaths of three cats and two dogs that died in the fire. Police accused Joly of setting the fire as a fake hate crime against himself – and a police report obtained by the Detroit News suggests he did it because he wanted attention.

Joly had opened Jackson’s first gay community center in the months preceding the fire and had tirelessly led the fight to pass an ordinance prohibiting discrimination against gays in the town. With both those battles won, however, Joly was at a loss for a good fight, according to two church officials who worked with him at the church that housed his Pride Center. The Jackson Pride Parade and Festival – which took place five days before the fire – simply wasn’t generating enough controversy.

Joly was “very deceptive” and displayed “layers of manipulation,” the officials told police, noting that he had broken the Pride Center away from the church that housed it without informing them of the move – even though they had secured the funding for the center in the first place.

While Joly didn’t own the house and gained nothing from the insurance money, the Jackson LGBT community raised $58,000 for him and his wife after the fire. Even as the money flowed in, the FBI was zeroing in on Joly as the culprit, rather than a local man who had objected to plans to display a rainbow flag in a city park during the Pride Festival. While they initially investigated the arson as a hate crime, the timeline of events ruled out any suspect other than Joly, and they were sure within two weeks that they had their man. Despite their evidence – and a lack of denial from Joly himself – it took over a year to actually charge him, as the prosecutor wanted more proof before accusing the locally-beloved gay activist of staging a hate attack against himself.

The parallels with Jussie Smollett's more recent self-inflicted lynching are numerous – a beloved figure, seeking attention, feeds into the narrative concerning the ugly undercurrents of hate we are told are lurking just beneath the surface of American society. Cops quickly start to suspect the “victim” but are forced to sit on their suspicions for fear of inflaming racial tensions. Both men profited from their crimes – either financially or through media attention.

There have been hundreds of fake hate crimes perpetrated since President Donald Trump took office, as if ‘hate-watch’ groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center’s predictions that hate incidents would rise under the Republican president were meant as self-fulfilling prophecies. FakeHateCrimes.org lists 348, and Kentucky State University political science professor Wilfred Reilly found 409 in his own research, but fake hate crimes are by no means a post-Trump phenomenon.

Kelly indicted; tide continues to turn against Smollett,"['Sentinel', 'Enterprise Contributor']",,"['day', 'episodes', 'turn', 'statement', 'tide', 'sexual', 'victims', 'chicago', 'r', 'empire', 'legal', 'indicted', 'smollett', 'series', 'kelly', 'busy', 'continues']","CHICAGO — R&B superstar R. Kelly was indicted Friday on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of four victims, at least three between the ages of 13 and 17, over a 12-year period.

The Cook County State Attorney’s office in Chicago detailed the charges at an afternoon press conference in the latest legal trouble for the acclaimed singer.

“Earlier today Robert Kelly was indicted before a Cook County grand jury on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims,” attorney Kimberly Foxx said at the press conference.

Foxx said the incidents began in 1998, and she identified the victims only by their initials.

“A grand jury returned an indictment on four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on the victims being under the age of 17 and Robert Kelly being more than five years older than the victim,” Foxx said.

Foxx then detailed the three other individuals, all of whom were described as victims of crimes alleged to have occurred over a period of years.

Kelly is scheduled to appear in bond court on Saturday. A message left to his lawyer was not immediately returned.

Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represented adult actress Stormy Daniels in her legal entanglements with President Donald Trump, handed over a 40-minute video to Cook County authorities last week that he said showed Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old.

For years, Kelly had faced allegations of sexual misconduct with minors, which formed the basis for a six-part television documentary series on the Lifetime network titled “Surviving R. Kelly.”

Kelly married his protege Aaliyah in 1994, but after Vibe magazine questioned the couple’s marriage certificate, it was learned that she was just 15. The marriage was swiftly annulled. In 2008, Kelly was acquitted of child-pornography charges after an underage girl who appeared in a video that showed her having sex with Kelly refused to testify in the case.

From the mid-1990s onward, Kelly’s songs, including “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition,” dominated the pop and R&B charts.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in Chicago, actor Jussie Smollett’s character on “Empire” will be removed from the final two episodes of this season in the wake of his arrest on charges that he staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself last month in downtown Chicago, producers of the Fox TV show announced Friday.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But, unfortunately, that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars."

Within hours of him being charged, many Americans questioned the stupidity of not only Smollett, but of those who rushed to condemn the fake attack.

The 49-year-old actor has spoken out in defence of his co-star - who is being investigated over reports he orchestrated an alleged homophobic and racist attack on himself - following the news producers have decided he will not be returning to set to shoot the final two episodes of the drama

26 February 2019

Terrence shared a video of his son Hero playing with Jussie on a private jet, and wrote on Instagram: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you""



Producers are keen to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show, and so have simply written Jussie's character, Jamal Lyon, out of the finale.



Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement to The Blast: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.



""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.



""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""



Jussie appeared in court on Thursday (21.02.19), where he was ordered to pay a $10,000 bond and surrender his passport after being arrested on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.



After the hearing, he headed straight to the Cinespace Studio in Chicago where he became ""very emotional"" as he maintained his innocence in a speech to the cast and crew of the show.



He reportedly said: ""I'm sorry I've put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I'm sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.""

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

Tweets from a Twitter account used by brothers Ola Osundairo, 27, and Abel Osundairo, 25, surfaced on Monday as the controversy surrounding Smollett's alleged attack continues.

'Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right,' Ola tweeted at a man in 2013, according to The Blast.

Another tweet read: 'YOU'RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.' It's unclear who Ola was referring to in that tweet.

Smollett, 36, was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime. He has denied the allegations against him

Smollett's defense team may be able to include the statements to show that the brothers appear to have issues with homosexuality.

The tweets go against the statements the brothers initially made publicly.

'We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.'

Smollett, 36, was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime.

He claimed two white men cornered him around 2am in Chicago on January 29.

Smollett said the men threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!'

However, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett made up the attack.

Police added that they believe Smollett paid the brothers to pretend to attack him because he was upset with his salary on Empire.

The tweets go against the statements the brothers (pictured) initially made publicly. 'We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens'

This is the check Smollett paid Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo to allegedly beat him up on January 29. He backdated it to January 23, according to police. Smollett labeled it '5 week nutrition/workout program' but the brothers say it was for the attack

Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson appeared on Good Morning America on Monday to defend the Chicago Police Department's investigation into the attack and double down on his condemnation of Smollett.

He batted away the Empire actor's claim that a $3,500 check for the brothers he allegedly paid to attack him was for personal training and said there was surveillance footage, physical evidence and testimony that proves it was a hoax which is yet to be presented.

'He still has the presumption of evidence and he'll get his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,' Johnson said, rejecting Smollett's lawyers claim that he has been unfairly vilified by the police department and prosecutor's office.

'I can tell you this, there's a lot more evidence that has not been presented yet that does not support his version of the incident.

The two brothers also told police that the Empire actor helped create the threatening letter he received at his studio, a week before the alleged attack.

Unnamed law enforcement sources told ABC last week that Smollett hired Ola and Abel as part of the staged attack after the letter that he received on the set of Empire did not get a 'bigger reaction'.

On January 22, the Empire actor received an envelope containing a letter and white powder.

Brothers Abel (left) and Ola (right) were released without charge last week after allegedly telling police Smollett paid them to perform the attack

The brothers also reportedly told police that Smollett is the source of the letter . This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident

The stamped letter was addressed to Chicago's Cinespace Studios, where the popular Fox drama Empire is filmed.

When the white powder was discovered, HAZMAT crews were called to the scene, but the substance was later determined to be crushed aspirin.

The letter was scrawled with the words 'You will die black f*g', spelled out in cut and pasted magazine letters, and MAGA which was written in red pen.

Smollett denies the allegations.

On Monday, a Chicago judge said Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he's free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett's character on Empire, expressed support for his fellow cast member amid the allegations.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: 'All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.'

The post on Saturday came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move 'to avoid further disruption on the set'."

A charming waterfront property has hit the market for the first time since the 1940s, and no time has been wasted in snapping it up.

It's got views fit for the rich and famous, but judging by the exterior you'd never guess its exorbitant price tag of nearly $10million.

The clifftop block in Sorrento, 100 kilometres south of Melbourne, had a flurry of keen potential buyers.

The three bedroom shack at 10 Netley Avenue is described as the 'peninsula’s most magnificent and scenic clifftop outlooks', and sits atop a 1400 square metre block.

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the million-dollar views of the Sorrento coast made the house hot property for potential buyers looking to knock down and rebuild

The home also features a bunk room, two bathrooms, open-plan living with fireplace, and opens out to the existing verandah with uninterrupted panoramic sea and coastal views.

A silent auction held on Valentine's Day saw the winning bidder come out on top, with six parties interested, and a total of just four bids put in.

The property was sold to a Melbourne based buyer, who already owns another Sorrento holiday home and offered just under the asking price.

The home, which sold for just below the $10 million asking price on February 14, has been in the Langford family for more than seven decades

The property had been in the Langford family, from Melbourne, for more than seven decades, which they used as a holiday home.

All potential buyers had similar plans to knock down the weatherboard weekender to make way for a new luxury home.



'The vendors were happy with the result, but are a little sad and emotional because they have owned it for such a long time,' Kay & Burton Portsea director Liz Jensen told realestate.com.au

All six potential buyers planned on knocking down and rebuilding a new luxury home on the lot, but in the end the property was snapped up by a Melbourne-based buyer

'For the buyers, they told me 15 years ago that they would like to buy a clifftop property like this and now their dream has come true,' Ms Jansen said.

In 2015 another house on a larger block, on Point Nepean Road, just a stone's throw from Netley Avenue, fetched $15.2 million.

Besides its understated charm and picture-perfect views, the property is an easy walk to the shops, cafes and golf course, and even comes with clifftop access to the beach."

So my wife and I spent a glorious Saturday walking along the Seine. We stopped for a drink on a cafe built on a peniche (riverboat) along the Pont Alexandre III. Our conversation turned on the Jussie Smollett hate hoax. She is a very well informed French journalist but had never heard of him nor his shenanigans in Chicago. After I made a brief description of his hoax she replied “C’est comme l’affaire de l’observatoire .”

François Mitterand , a future president of France, was in opposition to the nomination of Charles de Gaulle to come to power as the first president of the Fifth Republic in the fall of 1959. It was an especially tense period due to the continuing war in Algeria, at that time a part of France. Mitterand had a history as the interior minister (the head of the police) of aggressive action against the Algerian independence movement. In Paris, on the night of October 15 to 16, Mitterand left the famous Brasserie Lipp on the Boulevard Saint-Germain . He was being driven in his Peugeot 403 on the Avenue de l’Observatoire where he claimed his car was strafed by bullets. This brought sympathy to Mitterand and his political position. But about one week later the actual gunman or at least the organizer of the attack, Robert Pesquet, (a former right-wing member of the Assembly) accused François Mitterrand of having ordered the attack to publicize himself. Hence the recognition by my wife of this affair with Mr. Smollett. Pesquet had proof that he had met on more than one occasion with Mitterand. Mitterand later responded that he had been warned by Pesquet that he was the target of an Algérie française death squad and accused Prime Minister Michel Debré of being its instigator. An inconclusive investigation into the affair had the political result of putting Mitterand into the wilderness for over 20 years until he was elected president in 1981. To the best I have been able to find, it is generally agreed that the attack was a hoax, i.e., not to really meant to harm Mitterand. But was it planned by Mitterand or by his opponents as a setup (how is that for 3D chess?), is not definitively known. The Politically Incorr... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price: $1.51 Buy New $8.71 (as of 06:15 EST - Details)

I could easily imagine that it was Mitterrand who planned the hoax. A cursory study of his life reveals that he was an ultimate shapeshifter. At the beginning of WWII, he fought in the French army. After the fall of France, he served in the collaborationist Vichy government . But from 1943 to the end of the war he was fully in the resistance. After the war he rose in politics on the left. But as mentioned above, he was considered to be vicious in Algeria in his role as minister. In the left-wing magazine Jacobin , Ian Birchall has written, “For François Mitterrand, France’s atrocities in Algeria were stepping-stones to power.” Throughout his presidency, he kept a secret second family. He personally ordered the bombing of Greenpeace’s the Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand, resulting in one death and the sinking of the ship. And he is still a hero to the left in France.

Exploring the French capital is paradoxical considering the full scope of the past to the present. Virtually any corner of Paris can reveal a charming building where at the doorstep someone had died in battle or as the result of a crime. Many times, living in the 14th arrondissement, I had walked with my daughter in a stroller near where the attack occurred on Mitterand. Even on the day, we were enjoying our ballad along the Seine we could hear explosions from the flash-balls used by the gendarmes against the latest manifestation of the gilets jaunes. Vivé la France!, la France qui est très intéressant.

Over the last week or so, the internet has been abuzz over how Jussie Smollett allegedly faked a hate crime. Many are pointing to this as a prime example of why we should always be skeptical of stories of victimization. That would be the wrong lesson to take from this story.

To be clear: by no means am I defending falsifying a hate crime. However, it’s critical that we recognize how rare false allegations are compared to actual cases of victimization.

According to the FBI, there were 7,175 criminal hate crime incidents — as reported from various law enforcement agencies to the FBI — in 2017. That’s a 17 percent increase from the numbers reported in 2016.

Also increasing is the number of hate groups in the U.S. While the number of hate groups cataloged by the Southern Poverty Law Center dropped significantly from 2011 to 2014, they have been on the rise since then, with the 1,020 hate groups they cataloged in 2018 being the highest they’ve ever reported.

The real numbers are likely far worse. As the New York Times explains, “Only 12.6 percent of the agencies in the F.B.I. report indicated that hate crimes had occurred in their jurisdictions in 2017. Agencies as large as the Miami and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Departments reported zero,” despite a spokesperson for the Las Vegas police who said they had 61 that year. The actual number of hate crimes is almost certainly far higher.

Beyond the underreporting from law enforcement agencies, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, there is significant underreporting to law enforcement agencies. In the special report on hate crime statistics for 2004-2015, they highlighted that there are on average 250,000 hate crime victimizations every year. This number is significantly different from the FBI’s numbers, as the Department of Justice reached out to people instead of relying on law enforcement. They estimate that slightly over half of all hate crimes are never reported. And even when they are reported, it’s an open question of what the relevant law enforcement agency will do with this information.

ProPublica, the premier independent investigative newsroom, ran a report on law enforcement’s poor management of hate crimes. In some cases, law enforcement agencies said that they had no records, or only had bad records, due in part to the fact that “investigators frequently did not mark down incidents as motivated by bias, even if there was evidence suggesting this was so — a spray-painted swastika, for example, might be classified simply as vandalism and not also as a hate crime.”

Or as admitted by the Madison, Wisconsin police department, “officers weren’t trained in identifying bias-motivated incidents and had not been submitting reports properly as a result.” There were also widespread misconceptions from law enforcement agencies including thinking that, for example, prosecutors had to decide if an incident was a hate crime or they had to have a suspect in custody to categorize the incident as a hate crime.

I could go on and on about the problems with our law enforcement agencies, but our lesson should be very clear: hate crimes are real and they are very widespread.

What about false allegations of hate crimes?

A recent report on 2016-2018 hate crimes found less than 50 confirmed or suspected false reports of hate crimes. While false reporting is a problem, it is nothing compared to the actual problems of hate crimes in this country. We shouldn’t let the fact that these false reports get so much attention make us less likely to believe victims when they come forward. Not only is a report much, much more likely to be true than false, but there is significant harm done when we don’t believe victims.

While the above is about hate crimes, the same sort of reasoning applies to something much closer to home here in Boulder: sexual assault.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, between 20 percent and 25 percent of college women are victims of rape or attempted rape during their college career. Rates for other sorts of sexual assault are even higher. Compounding the problem, another DOJ study reports that most victims — in college or otherwise — of rape or sexual assault don’t report their assault. According to RAINN, only 20 percent of college women aged 18-24 report their sexual assault to law enforcement. And it’s not just women; the National Sexual Violence Resource Center reports that one in 16 men will be sexually assaulted while in college.

CU Boulder is no exception to these national trends. According to CU Boulder’s own data from 2015, 28 percent of undergraduate women and 6 percent of undergraduate men were victims of sexual assault.

Hopefully, none of this is news to regular readers of the CUI, as there has been significant coverage of CU’s insufficient handling of sexual assault, as well as the related issues of students allegedly being drugged at fraternity parties in recent months.

Despite significant evidence that sexual assault, especially campus sexual assault, is so prevalent, victims are rarely believed. A major reason, according to End Violence Against Women International’s Kimberly Lonsway, is that “believing them would require change on our parts … we don’t want sexual assault to be as prevalent as it is; we don’t want to think that it’s hurting people we love — and if we accept that sexual assault is happening to the extent that research is telling us, that means we have significant problems with the way men and women interact, the way sexual interactions are negotiated, and much of our gender roles and sexual behaviors.”

If we generally and genuinely believed survivors, we’d have to have a hard look in the mirror at ourselves and the society we live in.

Given the negative responses we often see when victims come forward, it should be no surprise that many don’t report being sexually assaulted. As said by a recent victim of sexual assault here at CU, “it felt like the university had chosen to protect itself rather than its students.”

Pam Fine, the woman who was assaulted for two years by CU Buff football coach Joe Tumpkin, was disappointed in how she was treated during the investigation into Tumpkin’s assaults.

“If I had followed this case in the news, I would not have come forward, and I worry about that … I work with young girls who have been assaulted, and I have always been an advocate for getting them the help they need and going through the process. But now, I can’t in good conscience tell someone I know to come forward, and that makes me sad,” Fine said in an interview with the Daily Camera.

While it’s hard to be confident about rates of non-reporting, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s review of the relevant studies finds that the rate of false reports of sexual assault is between 2 percent and 10 percent.

Of course, some of these reports do lead to significant injustices to victims of these false allegations — as we saw with Brian Banks and the heavily covered Duke Lacrosse case. However, as the BBC reports, “false rape accusations very rarely lead to convictions or wrongful jail time.”

While false reports can be damaging, according to the Chicago Tribune, young men are more likely to be perpetrators or victims of sexual assault than to be victims of false allegations.

We can’t let the rare — and again, real and damaging — harms of false accusations lead us to not believe survivors, be it of hate crimes or sexual assaults.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that we should blindly believe everything that we hear. The very police department now charging Smollett was the one that allegedly tried to cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald at the hands of Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke. This was only one of the 92 killings by the CPD from 2010 to 2015. While a judge eventually ruled not guilty in the cover-up, she admitted that the officers did contradict the video of the events. Police departments, from Chicago to Indiana to Baltimore, show time and time again that, in the words of Mapping Police Violence’s Samuel Sinyangwe, “the police don’t deserve your trust.”

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to claim that the allegations against Smollett are unfounded or that you can never believe police officers. Instead, we should do some serious reflection on who we believe and why.

We cannot let rare — even if abhorrent — false allegations of violence cause us to stop believing survivors. As the statistics show, by having your default being to believe survivors, you’re much less likely to be wrong, and therefore much less likely to heap more harm on the already victimized. Survivors of these horrific assaults are already dealing with terrible trauma, which is made all the worse when we refuse to acknowledge what happened. This leads to survivors being less likely to come forward, further harming them by making it more difficult to heal from the trauma.

Hate crimes are a real, widespread problem. So too are sexual assaults, especially at college. False allegations? Not so much.

1. There is little racism in America.

2. The left – white and black – is morally and psychologically impaired.

There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollet faked the ""racist"" attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, ""I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created ...""

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been ""an atmosphere of menace and hate"" since Donald Trump was elected president, which made ""people want to believe"" Smollett's story. Exactly. Capehart a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling ""This is MAGA country"" beat up blacks.

Another black leftist who writes hate columns for the Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: ""I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did."" Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling ""This is MAGA country"" beat up blacks.

Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, ""I wanted to be wrong."" Three paragraphs later: ""But still, I wanted to be wrong.""

This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.

Here's the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church? Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?

As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews – certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews – would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.

Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?

Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.

And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history – namely, that America is a racist country. If just one 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, ""You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),"" that would end the Democrats' chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens – and in the least-racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history – want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.

And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?"

Jussie Smollett’s bold appearance in the opening credits of the 1994 sitcom “On Our Own” was Hollywood’s introduction to the future star of Fox’s hip-hop drama “Empire,” who now faces felony charges and feverish backlash for reportedly orchestrating a hate crime against himself.

ABC’s short-lived comedy was also a first glimpse at the large and talented Smollett family, including Jurnee Smollett-Bell, who would grow up to score starring roles in WGN’s “Underground” and HBO’s “True Blood.” The six Smollett siblings starred in the sitcom, which lasted 20 episodes.

Key people from that show who have remained close to Smollett said his performance in the innocuous “On Our Own” and his subsequent turns in “Empire” and other projects gave no hint he would be accused of devising a plot that threatens to torpedo his career.

“Jussie was smart, talented and caring, a great person,” said Robert L. Boyett of Miller-Boyett Productions, one of the companies behind “On Our Own.”

“The Smolletts are a great family,” Boyett said in a phone interview. “I know them all, and we have stayed in touch since our show.”

Boyett said he is stunned by the firestorm surrounding Smollett, who has been charged with filing a false police report in which he claimed to have been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack. Two brothers told Chicago police they were acquaintances of Smollett and that he hired them for $3,500 to stage the attack as an attention-generating stunt.

“I still can’t imagine something like this,” Boyett said. “I feel that we still don’t know everything, that there’s another shoe to fall. I don’t know if this started out as a stunt or prank. But I know Jussie, and I know he doesn’t have a malicious bone in his body. He’s always been a sweet and caring guy. I stand by him. I will always be there for him.”

Even though “On Our Own,”developed as a vehicle for the Smolletts, had a short life, Boyett said he has fond memories of the series, which for part of its run was tied to ABC’s family-oriented TGIF state. In addition to the children, he was fond of their parents — Janet, who is African American, and their late father Joel, who was Jewish.

In the show, Jussie, Jurnee, JoJo. Jazz, Jake and Jacqui Smollett played the Jericho family, who were living on their own after their parents were killed in a car crash. As in real life, the characters played by the siblings ranged from 14 months to 20 years old. Starring as the eldest Jericho sibling in charge of the family was comedian Ralph Louis Harris, who was cast more for his acting chops and experience than for his resemblance to the Smollett brood.

Still, Harris said the Smolletts treated him as if he were a family member.

“I remember when I first walked into the room to meet everybody, it was Jussie and Jurnee who immediately got up from the table to greet me,” Harris said in a phone interview Thursday. “I will never forget that. They showed me a lot of love from day one. ABC and Miller-Boyett took real good care of us. And the family was so happy because this show was allowing them to live out their dream — to work together. And they treated us all like royalty.”

Harmony appears to have always been a centerpiece of the Smollett chemistry. During the filming of “On Our Own,” the siblings shared a large dressing room filled with toys. Jazz, the second oldest, said in an interview at that time, “We love each other. We’re really close.” Added JoJo, the oldest Smollett, “We’ve been brought up to reject conflict. We think it’s a waste of time to fight and argue.”

Jussie was rarely at the center of the story in the show, “but he was always caring about what was happening with the other folks on the show,” said Boyett. “He was always focused on the set.”

The young star also seemed to have his priorities in perspective, saying his family would not wind up like other troubled child stars. “We’ve been brought up to be real strong, so nothing can take us down,” Jussie said.

Growing up in New York, the siblings had watched other young people on TV and decided they could do just as well. Their mother became their manager. Jazz became a successful child model, JoJo and Jussie did small movie roles, and Jurnee won roles on sitcoms, including “Full House.”

In a 2016 appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Smollett said network executives initially didn’t quite know what to do with the family.

“The next thing we know, we’re in a meeting with ABC. I mean, all these old-ass white men. So we went in, and I don’t know why, but we went in and sang ‘Shut ‘Em Down’ by Public Enemy,” Smollett said. “But yo, they loved it. Apparently they wanted to shut it down too. But then I guess they didn’t like it anymore because they canceled us. They shut us down.”

But the cancellation did not damage their connection. In a People magazine interview, Jussie spoke of family meals, describing how the family would gather around a large wooden table built from scratch by their mother.

“That was the vault,” Jussie said. “The place where you could say what you wanted. Whether you were happy or frustrated, you could lay it out on the family table.”

Harris said he’s remained connected to the family since the end of “On Our Own.” Asked about Smollett’s troubles, he declared, “I’m standing by my brother. I will jump in and fight for him. I will protect him.”

He added, “If he needs any help of any kind, I hope he gets it. No matter how this turns out, there’s no way for this to end without him coming out with scars.”"

Then some unwelcome news arrived from a courtroom on Cape Cod: A Massachusetts judge had ruled a $4 million defamation lawsuit filed against her last April by her ex-husband, David Sorensen, would be allowed to go to trial.

With a court battle looming, Corbett said, her fiance’s family wanted the couple to hit the brakes on the wedding. Feeling awful, she agreed.

Soon after, Corbett climbed into the bathtub in their Portland apartment and came down with what she called a panic attack.

“It all came to a head and I snapped,” Corbett said Monday. “I tried to kill myself. I took a whole lot of pills.”

For Corbett, 33, it was just one more moment in her long odyssey to escape a bad marriage and slip away from Sorensen for good. Had she followed the “silent underground railroad” that many women in her shoes take, she said, perhaps it would have gone better.

But when she chose to tell The Washington Post a year ago about her life with Sorensen, he quickly lost his White House position and began a public effort to clear his name by accusing Corbett of lying about their 2½-year marriage. During their time together, Sorensen served as a top aide to former Gov. Paul LePage while Corbett held a series of political positions.

Sorensen has repeatedly — and heatedly — denied he was ever violent toward Corbett. Their rocky marriage, which included her throwing a diamond ring at him, ended in divorce in 2016.

“I have never been violent in any way toward any woman in my entire life,” Sorensen said Monday. “The thought of it disgusts me.”

For both of them, though, the trauma continues. Sorensen apparently hopes winning a defamation lawsuit will clear his name, while Corbett insists she has already lost everything but will not renounce the truth of their relationship.

Their split, Corbett said, “forced me to give up my life as I knew it,” leaving behind the political world in Augusta and most of the mutual friends she and Sorensen shared.

But when she found new love and got engaged at Christmas 2017, she thought she had moved past the trauma and hurt — until she had to call off the July 13 wedding.

When Corbett gulped down pills three days before she had planned to wed, her fiance called 911 and sent her off to the hospital, where doctors kept her on a suicide watch and made sure she pulled through.

In the morning, physicians said she could go home. She phoned her fiance, who had promised to return to bring her home.

“I gotta go,” he told her before hanging up.

When the hospital released Corbett, said she was surprised he was not there. So she took her purse, “just reeling and stunned,” and began walking home. Before too long, she thought to call an Uber.

When she arrived at their apartment, she immediately noticed that only one of two pairs of Bean boots sat outside the door. Inside, one dog barked — hers. His was silent.

At that moment, “my heart shattered,” Corbett said.

“It was like the glass slipper broke,” Corbett said, her Cinderella period shattered for good.

When she finally got inside, she found he had taken all of his stuff and left. She never heard from him directly again.

Sorensen said he is “glad to learn her fiance escaped before she inflicted permanent damage on his life like she did on mine.

“Her life will improve only when she gets the help even her best friends say she needs, and when she stops seeking the attention she craves,” Sorensen said.

Corbett said that after the wedding fell through, she felt alone, but soon realized she was not.

Corbett said her friends in the neighborhood rallied to help, making sure she did not just spend her days crying. They got her food. They got her moving.

They helped find her a new apartment that turned out to be on her favorite block along Morning Street, where she had always hoped to live. They hired her to clean houses and Airbnb apartments.

“This community has been very kind to me,” Corbett said, reeling off the names of at least a dozen people who went out of their way to provide support when she was “hanging by a thread.”

But she had seen many others in far worse shape when she was volunteering at The Root Cellar, a privately funded community center that lends a hand to people in the area surrounding it on Washington Avenue. It helped her find perspective on her own woes.

Since last spring, Corbett has tried to stay out of the public eye, not venturing onto social media because she was sick of dealing with the trolls and feeling rattled from the constant pressure.

Then she learned Patrisha McLean, former wife of famed singer Don McLean, was standing up to her ex-husband.

“That kind of enraged me to see her under assault,” with the musician “using the courts” to attack her the same way she believes Sorensen is relying on them to go after her.

Inspired my McLean and fueled by “a puddle of tears,” Corbett said she decided to write up a brief account of her “life as it is today, laid bare” in a series of comments on Twitter last week.

At the end of that thread, she invited readers to donate to her legal defense fund, hoping she might raise a couple thousand dollars to pay a lawyer so she could fight Sorensen’s lawsuit.

Sorensen said Corbett “is turning to political activist strangers for help because people who know her don’t believe her. She is the female Jussie Smollett,” the actor who allegedly faked a racial attack in Chicago recently.

Corbett’s fundraiser did better than she expected.

By Monday afternoon, her post had been retweeted almost 5,000 times, including by some celebrities, and more than 700 people had chipped in more than $27,000, including McLean.

Corbett called the flood of financial assistance a sign from God that everything is going to be OK.

“I prayed for a miracle,” Corbett said, “and I got one.”

Now, she said, she can defend herself in court and, with luck, fend off Sorensen’s case.

“He’s taken so much from me,” Corbett said. “He cannot take the truth.”

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s attorneys, who say he’s innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who’s based in Los Angeles, is Smollett’s lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack , then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Here’s a recap of the key events that occurred since the attack:

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett told police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The actor says the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, told detectives the attackers also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics have decried as racist and discriminatory.

On Jan. 30, Chicago police said they had reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none shows the attack. Police obtained and released images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

Reports of an assault on Smollett drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

On Jan. 31, Trump told reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett, saying: “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Smollett’s family issued a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family said he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he had been less than cooperative and changed his story.

On Feb. 1, Smollett issued a statement telling people he’s OK and thanking them for their support. He said he was working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

On Feb. 2, Smollett gave a concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

On Feb. 12, Chicago police said Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police said the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett said he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

On Feb. 13, Chicago police picked up two men they identified as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learned at least one worked on “Empire.” Police questioned the brothers and searched the apartment where the men live.

On Feb. 14, Chicago police said local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

The producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

On Feb. 15, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He said the men—identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria—are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

Chicago police released the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman said the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

On Feb. 16, police said the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned the two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police said they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers said the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

On Feb. 17, Chicago police said they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi said police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but said an interview has not been conducted.

Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

On Feb. 19, Chicago police investigated a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismissed the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided."

Judge Allows Smollett to Travel to Meet With Attorneys

CHICAGO—A Chicago judge says “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he’s free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

On Feb. 17, Chicago police said they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi said police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but said an interview has not been conducted.

Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case, saying: “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten.”

On Feb. 19, Chicago police investigated a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian brothers. Police later dismissed the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

Chicago’s top prosecutor, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, recused herself from the investigation. Her office says the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution … to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.” No details were provided."

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who’s based in Los Angeles, is Smollett’s lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack , then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Ever wondered about how far celebrities are prepared to go to advance their career and promote their brand? We recently learnt that ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett allegedly staged his own “homophobic, racial attack” because he was being written out of the popular television show. Smollett, an openly gay African-American actor who plays a gay character on the US drama series, informed the Chicago police that two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs before they put a rope around his neck. He alleged that his attackers “poured an unknown chemical substance on him”. The initial news of the alleged assault sparked outrage on social media but recent reports of Smollett faking the attack to benefit his career caused a serious meltdown. If the attack was staged, it will be revealed in due course.

Closer to home, in January, Mzansi’s Nomuzi Mabena staged a car crash during a live Instagram story.

It was later revealed that the “apparent crash” was part of a marketing campaign against drinking and driving.

The video that went viral caused a debate on social media, with Mabena being bashed and the campaign receiving mixed reactions, especially regarding its impact.

Last week’s episode of Mzansi Magic’s ""Date My Family"" saw Durban-based comedian Siyanda Maphumulo looking for love on one of South Africa’s dating shows.

However, many concluded that Maphumulo was merely looking for a career boost instead of a partner.

In recent years we’ve seen local and international stars faking break-ups just for the sake of making headlines.

It does beg the question, is all publicity, good publicity?"

Kim Jong Un crossed into Vietnam with fanfare and a red carpet Tuesday – as an attendant scurried, looking like his life depended on it, to catch up to the absolute leader’s side.

The North Korean dictator later drove to Hanoi after a 2,800 mile train journey, accompanied by dozens of security guards who sprinted to surround him as he entered the hotel where he will stay until his summit with President Trump.

Included in his lengthy motorcade that snaked its way through the Vietnamese capital was an armored vehicle complete with a mounted gun turret on top. It later parked around the corner from Kim's hotel, while locals on scooters made their way through the city's packed streets.

As he reached his final destination, Kim's team of protective agents jumped out of a line of black SUVs to enter Kim’s hotel. They could be seen riding with vehicle doors open, then rushing to the heavily-guarded leader.

An administration official was unable to identify the sprinting North Korean, but noted to DailyMail.com: 'He's fast.'

Vietnamese military and police blocked off streets for hours before his arrival, with onlookers bearing Vietnamese, U.S., and North Korean flags waiting to catch a glimpse of the leader of the hermetic nation.

Kim's arrival turned out to be inconvenient for traveling American media, who had been preparing to make use of a media file set up by the White House travel office, who had spent days organizing it – even setting up a podium for potential press briefings with four American flags. The entire location was scrapped, at least temporarily, with Kim's arrival.

It turned out that Kim had booked the same hotel that was to have been used as a base of operations for reporters who cover the White House.

Vietnam's ministry of foreign affairs tweeted: 'The American Media Center will be relocated' from the hotel where Kim was staying to an International Media Center.

Tweeted CNN's Jim Acosta in response: 'Translation: The US press is being booted out of the hotel where we have spent days setting up our workspace.'

The Washington Post quoted a person inside the hotel who witnessed a 'tense standoff' between a North Korean official who chewed out Vietnamese security and hotel staff, demanding journalists not take pictures from the lobby.

The odd image of an aide rushing to Kim's side jumped out at the culmination of his two and a half day rail journey, which may have been chosen to evoke memories of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. On the way to the Singapore summit, Kim was seen exiting an American-made Air China 747 jet.

On Wednesday evening, President Trump is set to hold his first meetings with Kim since their June summit in Singapore.

They are scheduled to have a brief one-on-one greeting, followed by a 'social dinner,' where Trump will be joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Kim is expected to be accompanied by Kim Yung Chol, the general and senior leader who delivered a letter to Trump from Kim, as well as by another associate.

Translators also will be there.

Trump took off for Hanoi Monday facing new pressure to demonstrate he can secure concrete pledges from Kim Jong-un after repeatedly gushing about the riches that await if the North Korean dictator backs away from his nuclear weapons program.

Trump’s previous summit with Kim, held in Singapore in June, resulted in a vague joint statement that critics blasted for lacking specific measurable stapes – it pledged the two sides would ‘work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’

Trump set an optimistic tone on Twitter as prepared to head east: ‘Meeting for breakfast with our Nation’s Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!’ Trump wrote.

He also mocked his critics – including security experts who have raised alarms Trump will make concessions on the diplomatic front without requiring much of substance of Kim in return other than the continued cessation of missile launches.

‘So funny to watch people who have failed for years, they got NOTHING, telling me how to negotiate with North Korea. But thanks anyway!’ Trump tweeted Sunday.

A senior administration official acknowledged as recently as Friday the two sides had yet to agree on what denuclearization even means.

Kim arrived in Vietnam after train journey that took him through China ahead of his second historic showdown with President Trump.

Kim emerged from the train station doors issuing the cheering crowd a beaming smile and a series of waves, before being shepherded into a black limousine.

A 170 km stretch of highway has been completely closed off by authorities, which Kim and his entourage will travel on to get to Hanoi for Wednesday's meeting.

An entourage secret service agents jogged alongside the dictator's black-out car as it set off on its two hour journey.

President Trump opted for a more conventional means of travel as he boarded Air Force one on Monday afternoon. He's expected to arrive late on Tuesday.

Before his departure, the President offered an optimistic tune regarding the week ahead.

'I think we could have a very good summit,' he told the nation's governors during their meeting at the White House on Monday morning. 'I think we’ll have a very tremendous summit. We want denuclearization, and I think he’ll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy.'

He also tweeted from inside the presidential plane that he was looking forward to a 'productive' meeting with Kim.

'Got off AF1 for a refuel stop at RAF Mildenhall. Thankful for the amazing men and women in our military,' his Instagram caption read.

He still has another 12 hours left on his journey and will likely land in Hanoi at 7pm local time on Tuesday.

24 hours earlier, Trump hosted the Governor's Ball in the White House's State Dining Room where he sought to cool expectation ahead of the summit.

'What's going to happen, I can't tell you,' Trump teased.

'I'm not in a rush, I don't want to rush anybody, I just don't want testing.

'As long as there's no testing, we're happy.'

The president has been promoting denuclearization - expected to be the main topic on the agenda of his sit down with Kim - as a way for North Korea to become an 'Economic Powerhouse.'

'Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the world,' Trump tweeted on Sunday.

'Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation.'

Trump's enthusiasm is in contrast to his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said Sunday there may have to be a third summit because Trump and Kim 'may not get everything done this week.'

'There may have to be another summit,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday. 'We may not get everything done this week. We hope we'll make a substantial step along the way.'

While President Trump tweeted about the possibility of denuclearization on Sunday, his secretary of state offered a more measured set of expectations for the second meeting between the two leaders this week in Hanoi, Vietnam.

'The U.N. Security Council has demanded, not the United States, but the U.N. Security Council has demanded that Chairman Kim give up these weapons systems. It's in the best interest of his country and I hope we can make a real substantive step forward this week. It may not happen but I hope that it will,' Pompeo said.

Trump and Kim will meet Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi. Kim left for their summit via train while Trump flies out Monday.

On the agenda is denuclearization.

Washington is looking for concrete steps from North Korean that progress has been made on that front after Kim pledged to eliminate his country's nuclear weapons' program at his and Trump's first summit in Singapore last summer.

Trump said last week that North Korea must do 'something that's meaningful' on denuclearization before he would consider lifting economic sanctions.

North Korea has pushed for those sanctions to be reduced before it makes major changes to its nuclear program.

But Pompeo cautioned real progress on denuclearization could take time.

Mike Pompeo arrived shortly after Kim. In interviews this week, the Secretary of State appeared less enthusiastic than Trump in his expectations for the summit

He told Fox News there might be another summit because Trump 'may not get everything done this week'

'We have always known this would take time and it would be a step forward, and slower than the world has demanded, right? This is a U.N. Security Council resolution that we're attempting to achieve by getting North Korea fully denuclearized,' he said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union.'

'I'm hopeful that, when President Trump and Chairman Kim get together, they will make a big step towards realizing what Chairman Kim promised. He promised he would denuclearize. We hope he will make a big step towards that in the week ahead,' he added.

He declined to get into the specifics of what the U.S. wanted from Pyongyang.

'There are many things he could do to demonstrate his commitment to denuclearization. Our negotiating team was on the ground the last three days. And they will be on the ground again today. I will be there tomorrow to continue these discussion,' Pompeo said.

'I don't want to get into the details of what's being proposed, what the offers and counteroffers may be. But a real step, a demonstrable, verifiable step is something that I know President Trump is very focused on achieving,' he added.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper also called out Pompeo for contradicting President Trump on whether or not North Korea remains a nuclear threat.

'Do you think North Korea remains a nuclear threat?,' Tapper asked Pompeo when the secretary of state appeared on 'State of the Union.

'Yes,' Pompeo responded.

'But the president said he doesn't,' Tapper pointed out.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper also called out Pompeo for contradicting President Trump on whether or not North Korea remains a nuclear threat

After his first summit with Kim in Singapore, Trump claimed 'there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.'

'Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,' Trump tweeted last June. 'There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!'

Pompeo took issue with Tapper's characterization of Trump's remarks.

'That's not what he said,' Pompeo noted.

'He tweeted: 'There's no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,'' Tapper said in response.

'What he said was that the efforts that had been made in Singapore, this commitment that Chairman Kim, may have substantially taken down the risk to the American people. It's the mission of the secretary of state and the president of the United States to keep the American people secure. We're aiming to achieve that,' Pompeo argued.

'OK. I mean, that's just a direct quote, but I want to move on,' Tapper said.

Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest said Trump and Kim need to take 'at least one step forward on denuclearisation' in Hanoi.

'Nothing would be worse than for either side to come out of the meeting as if it was a waste of time,' he said."

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement that his record ""has been wiped clean"" after Chicago police accused the actor of staging his attack because he was “dissatisfied” with his ""Empire"" salary last month.

Cops alleged that Smollett paid Ola and Abel Osundairo $3,500 via a check to help him stage the assault.

While Smollett's current ""Empire"" salary is unknown, according a Variety report from 2016, the show's second season, he was making significantly less than his co-stars. At that time it was reported that he earned around $20,000, while co-stars Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson were getting paid around $175,000 per episode.

However, the show has been a hit -- having completed its fifth season -- and given its success salaries are expected to have risen commensurately.

Smollett's salary was reported in line with Howard and Henson's on-screen children, Trai Byers and Bryshere Y. Gray.

Smollett's overall net worth is also below his co-stars, according to data from GoBankingRates.com.

Here's a look at some ""Empire"" cast members' reported net worths, according to the personal finance site.

The charge and consequent arrest came after two brothers, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, claimed Jussie paid them to stage the attack.

There has been a lot of speculation about Smollett’s motive; two prominent theories suggest Smollett was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire,” and he felt there was an underwhelming reaction to a threatening letter he received (which he is also being accused of sending) a week before the alleged attack. Regardless of his motive, one thing is certain: the exploitation of racism and homophobia for personal gain is utterly despicable. If these allegations are true, Smollett should face the utmost accountability for his actions. However, myself and many others do not regret believing him.

The prevalence of hate crimes has increased over the past three years, largely (or entirely) due to the increase of damaging racial rhetoric sweeping the country. Studies have observed that “hate crime victims often do not trust that reporting will help them.” This kind of deep distrust is at play in Chicago, a hub of violence against black people, where the police have proven time and time again that they should not be trusted when it comes to protecting black lives.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is black, said of the hoax, “Why would anyone, especially an African-American, use a noose…to further his public profile?” Though Superintendent Johnson is not wrong to highlight just how despicable Smollett’s exploitation of a symbol of extreme violence against black people in this country, the Chicago PD has no right to claim a higher moral ground.

The CPD is 14 times more likely to use aggressive force against young black men than their white peers. This includes fatal shootings, such as the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in November 2015. The murderer, former CPD officer Jason Van Dyke, was only sentenced to 81 months in prison. The damage the CPD has done to countless black lives vastly outweighs the impact of Smollett’s alleged lies.

It is also important to note that a disproportionate amount of resources were put into solving the Smollett case, while a great number of cases still remain unsolved by the CPD. Superintendent Johnson remarked, “I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because that’s who really deserves the amount of attention that we are giving to this particular incident.” Chicago has a homicide clearance rate of approximately 17%. People such as Rashad Pratt, who was fatally shot sitting in his SUV over seven years ago, will likely never get justice. But that’s not Smollett’s fault. The CPD has deep-rooted issues that need to be fixed, and Smollett should not become a scapegoat.

I will say one final thing to those “concerned” that Smollett’s alleged hoax will make it less likely for other people to be believed: black people have never been believed by the majority. This alleged hoax only gives an excuse to bigots, those who stay complacent and anyone else in between to keep on not believing their stories. When black people share their stories of discrimination and violence, they are dismissed and often blamed for what happened to them. Why do you think it took decades for R. Kelly to be arrested?

I will continue to believe those who speak out about hate crimes and other violence perpetrated against POC and other minority groups in this country. Smollett’s appropriation of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan did not change what it represents: unadulterated ignorance and hatred. Do not let one allegedly false report diminish the chance of justice for the real victims."

Police have arrested a transgender and gay rights activist for allegedly burning down his own home to make it look like a hate crime.

Nikki Joly, who organized a number of pro-LGBTQ events and initiatives is accused of intentionally setting fire to his own house in 2017.

Five pets died in the blaze and the FBI initially investigated the incident as a hate crime.

However a new police report suggests that Joly was simply looking for further publicity to advance his cause.

The arrest comes in the wake of the scandal involving actor Jussie Smollett who has been accused of staging his own hate crime in order to promote his career.

Meanwhile, Joly was a celebrated figure in the local LGBTQ community for helping to build a gay community center, organizing a gay pride parade and helping to push through legislation at a local level forbidding companies from discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The aftermath of the fire at Joly's home. Police found traces of gasoline on his clothes

The Jackson, Michigan community launched a fundraising effort that raised $58,000 after the blaze, however according to police it now appears to have been one big hoax

Joly was so well known he was even named Citizen of the Year according to The Detroit News.

'It's embarrassing? How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?' Travis Trombley, who is homosexual, asked The News.

According to a police report, two members of the St. John's United Church of Christ where the gay community center is located believed Joly was anxious to generate more news about LGBTQ rights.

Joly had allegedly become visibly disappointed when the 2017 Jackson Pride Parade and Festival had not generated more publicity, good or bad.

Police say Joly was looking for further publicity to advance his cause

In the months prior to the fire, Joly helped open Jackson's first gay community center and organized the city's first gay pride parade and festival

According to Metro News, investigator Aaron Grove, who interrogated Shelton and James, said the pair described Joly as 'very deceptive' and possessing 'layers of manipulation.'

Joly had just got married before the fire and the pair received $58,000 in fundraising from supporters.

He took to Facebook two days after telling supporters: 'Yes, be angry, be very angry.'

'Use that anger to force good! Use that anger to make change.'

But police were already turning their attentions to Joly after discovering he had bought $10 of gas at a local Marathon store on the morning of the fire.

Joly said he had done so to cut the grass, but his version of how he had spent the day meant there was only a five minute window for any arsonist to break into his home, douse it with fuel and set it ablaze.

Joly married his girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire destroyed his home

Five pets — two German Shepherds and three cats — died in the fire. The body of one dog blocked a door as firefighters tried to enter

The police report said that gasoline was found in five rooms of Joly's two-story, wooden-frame house.

Traces of gasoline were also found on the equality campaigner's clothes.

Joly is said to have refused to confirm or deny setting the blaze at the rented home during a subsequent police interview.

The arson suspect, who made his first appearance in court earlier this month, has since denied setting the fire deliberately.

His attorney Daniel Barnett said Joly was happy with the level of attention he had received.

Barnett added: 'It doesn't make sense.

'He was citizen of the year. There was plenty of media coverage already before the fire.'

The alleged hate hoax comes after Chicago prosecutors charged Empire actor Jussie Smollett for filing a false report with police in connection to staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself last month

The attorney also drew attention to Joly's campaigning, and highlighted how much he had done for the cause of LGBT rights in Jackson.

Five pets — two German Shepherds and three cats — died in the fire. The body of one dog blocked a door as firefighters tried to enter.

Joly was charged with one felony count of first-degree arson in October 2018, according to Michigan Live, and was charged with two counts of animal killing the following December. His case is still ongoing.

The alleged hate hoax comes after Chicago prosecutors charged Empire actor Jussie Smollett for filing a false report with police in connection to staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself last month.

Smollett told police two masked individuals hurled bigoted insults and doused him with an unknown chemical substance while walking home from a sandwich shop at 2am.

The actor also told police his assailants looped a thin rope around his neck and shouted 'This is MAGA country!' before fleeing.

He allegedly enlisted the help of two brothers — Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo — to stage the attack, paying them $3,500 by check.

Smollett returned to the Chicago set of Empire after posting bond for $100,000 at a Cook County courthouse hours prior.

However, Smollett's role on the hit show uncertain as executive producers considering recasting his character."

“The deep state officers were dressed in tactical vests with large weapons. They were wearing night vision glasses. This is the [special counsel Robert] Mueller Deep State at work,” reports The Gateway Pundit. “They send out fully armed tactical teams to harass and abuse political opponents in the dead of night. And only CNN hacks get tipped off before hand.”

Stone, 66, didn’t resist and no one thought ahead of time that he would. He had no guns in his house. He was sleeping at the time of the raid. And he ‘went quietly.’ But the SWAT-like effort to arrest him smacked of intimidation and for no good reason other than Mueller’s authoritarian prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, wanted to ‘send a message’ to anyone else associated with the president they could expect the same treatment.

Meanwhile, just days after Stone’s Jan. 25 arrest, a previously obscure actor unknown to Americans outside of a few million faithful who are fans of “Empire,” the Fox Television program he stars in, was plotting a hate crime hoax that would eventually result in his arrest as well.

By now most Americans know the name Jussie Smollett, and they know him alternately as the actor who faked a hate crime or the actor who was driven to fake a hate crime by the “racial hatred and bigotry” of the president and his growing legions of supporters. (Related: PREDICTION: Jussie Smollett will confess, then blame “racist America” for driving him to fake his own hate crime, TRIPLING down on being the “victim.”)

While people debate that point (for some reason), what is crystal clear is that the manner in which Stone and Smollett were taken into custody was very different.

Very different.

There is good reason why rank-and-file cops in Chicago are angry about Smollett arrest

Stone was treated as though he was a ranking member of a criminal cartel. While the FBI did not use an actual SWAT team to make the arrest, most of the two dozen agents who stormed his home around 6 a.m. were armed with “assault” rifles and wearing body armor, though Stone didn’t have a single firearm, according to reports.

Did the charges against Stone warrant this kind of massive show of force? Were government agents concerned he would put up a fight? Was there some intelligence the FBI had suggesting that Stone was holed up in his home with several other gunmen? No to all of that.

Smollett was not subjected to the same kind of ridiculously over-hyped arrest. In fact, he was notified by Chicago PD that he was going to be charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Granted, his alleged crime also did not warrant the response of a police SWAT team and nearly 30 officers.

But neither did Stone’s arrest for a similarly non-violent criminal action. The difference appears to be that Stone is a Trump associate and Smollett is a Left-wing, Trump-hating, gay, black actor.

Nevertheless, rank-and-file Chicago PD officers were none too happy with the manner in which Smollett was taken into custody and treated with kid gloves, according to Quillette journalist Andy Ngo, who observed in a tweet that “rank and file officers at CPD are angry at how their PR is coddling” the actor with soothing public statements.

“I know this can be difficult emotionally, and we hope he doesn’t do anything terrible. We want to make this as diplomatic as possible. In the end, this is only a class 4 felony. He will get through this and we want to make it as easy as possible for him to do it. But again it is about accountability,” Chicago PD police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, after also stating that the department would “negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest.”

Source tells me that the rank and file officers at CPD are angry at how their PR is coddling Smollett with comments like this. He is wanted for a felony offense & his location remains unknown. https://t.co/0HXLNfVUuz pic.twitter.com/XgAnmKsBZn — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 21, 2019

“Negotiate a surrender.” No wonder rank-and-file officers are bitter.

And Stone, too.

1. There is little racism in America.

2. The left -- white and black -- is morally and psychologically impaired.

There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollet faked the ""racist"" attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, ""I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created....""

Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been ""an atmosphere of menace and hate"" since Donald Trump was elected president, which made ""people want to believe"" Smollett's story. Exactly. Capehart a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling ""This is MAGA country"" beat up blacks.

Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: ""I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did."" Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling ""This is MAGA country"" beat up blacks.

Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, ""I wanted to be wrong."" Three paragraphs later: ""But still, I wanted to be wrong.""

This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.

Here's the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church? Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?

As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews -- certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews -- would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.

Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?

Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.

And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history -- namely, that America is a racist country. If just one 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, ""You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks [or any other race or ethnicity],"" that would end the Democrats' chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.

And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens -- and in the least-racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history -- want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.

And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?

He returned last November with his clever, jarring EP, FM!. A few months prior, he launched a campaign on GoFundMe promising to “shut the fuck up forever,” followed by a single called “Get The Fuck Off My Dick.” Today, Staples sat down with GQ for the most entertaining interview since Quincy Jones’ circuit last year.

Throughout the interview, Staples shared blunt opinions on topics ranging from fashion to his fanbase. The interviewer begins by complimenting Staples’ sweater and asking him if he’s sad about Raf Simons leaving Calvin Klein. “I don’t care about him,” Staples responds. “I’m not a big fan of [Raf Simons]. They’re not what they create. They can create whatever but I can think they’re dickheads.”

He’s also not a big fan of pizza: “Pizza’s disgusting…I don’t want to kill myself, I’m cool. If you have to go to sleep after you eat something, you shouldn’t be eating it.”

GQ later mentions Barack Obama wearing a bomber jacket at a recent Duke-UNC game. “It just had a number on it. People are easily pleased nowadays. What am I supposed to say? He had on a black bomber jacket and they had the number 44 on the sleeve. What the fuck do that mean,” Staples retorts. “Rag & Bone is worse than Uniqlo.”

“Ah, man, free the Juice Man. He’s just running a little scam,” Staples says on Empire star Jussie Smollett’s staged hate crime. “Shit, the fact he feels like he has to do that says more about this world and less about him. Because nobody wants to do that. Hopefully he don’t get time because police are smoking people, falsifying police reports, and they get to go home so let my boy go home.”

When questioned about Tristan Thompson cheating on Khloe Kardashian, Staples doesn’t entertain the subject: “I think everybody who is obsessed with that on the internet is a loser. I really think that they’re lame as fuck. I think everyone involved is a fucking loser. I think the journalists are fucking losers. I think the people who are making jokes out of people’s lives are all fucking losers because they know who they do that shit to.”

On performing, Staples sizes up his audience candidly: “They want the same thing from everybody’s show: 30 seconds on Instagram and a T-shirt to wear later.” He says he wishes his fans wouldn’t idolize him: “I think everyone is the same, we all on the same path of life and one day you’re gonna fucking die, you gonna stink, and they put embalming fluid in you, and you might come back as a pony or something. But until then it’s like, everyone’s pretty even.”

“I’m for sure not going to be doing this shit forever. Why would I? It’s a scam,” Staples says. “You can only get so far [with hip-hop]. Jay-Z and Puffy make their money from business ventures more than they did from music. So why would I do this forever?”

He maintains he is innocent.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says there is ""a lot more evidence"" that has yet to be presented that supports the charge that Empire star Jussie Smollett staged his alleged hate crime attack.

Sitting down with Robin Roberts on ABC's Good Morning America on Monday, the police chief said of the ongoing investigation into Smollett: ""There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave. There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.""

The sit-down comes weeks after Roberts conducted Smollett's first televised and emotional interview after his alleged attack, in which the Chicago police said he provided information that delayed their investigation. During the interview, Smollett reiterated his claim that his attackers were white. Smollett, who is black and gay and who plays the gay musician Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire, told Roberts that he believed he was the victim of a homophobic and racially motivated assault. He had told police when he first reported the incident that his attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments, and racist and homophobic language before and during the beating. According to the report, a chemical substance was poured on Smollett's face and a rope was placed around his neck.

During a Feb. 21 press briefing, Johnson and his law enforcement colleagues outlined what they called a ""hoax"" attack, alleging Smollett paid brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who are of Nigerian descent, $3,500 to stage his assault. He chided Smollett for the extra resources the Chicago department used for their investigation into what they were at first treating as a hate crime due to Smollett's account. The prosecutors also released a detailed bond proffer outlining the case.

Smollett was charged with federal disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report, a class 4 felony charge that carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison and up to $25,000 in fines. On Monday, a Chicago judge allowed Smollett to travel out of the state in order to meet with his lawyers in California and New York.

After posting bail and returning to the Empire set (the show's executive producers later announced that Smollett would be cut from the final two episodes, which are currently being filmed), the actor and his legal team issued a statement maintaining Smollett's innocence and vowing to mount an ""aggressive"" defense, saying in a statement that he ""feels betrayed"" by the criminal justice system. Smollett is due back in court in March.

When speaking to Roberts, Johnson clarified that his statements about the case are not opinions and are based on a ""surfeit of evidence"" gathered by investigators before the actor was charged. ""It's important for people to recognize that it's not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it's the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this,"" he said.

Chicago police said Smollett first attempted to gain attention by sending a false racist letter to his place of work. ""When that didn't work, he paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process,"" Johnson said during the press briefing. Police officials said they had the check in evidence and ABC News confirmed that the check was made out to the brothers, who are now cooperating witnesses in the case.

The check's memo line reads, ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don't Go),"" ABC confirmed, a note that TMZ had reported could be a reference to training sessions, and was dated Jan. 23, six days before the alleged attack. Johnson, however, when speaking to Roberts, said the brothers told them the check was to ""carry out this incident."" A Chicago Police Department spokesperson also told ABC News the interview where the brothers told police about the money is electronically recorded.

Chicago police, during the scathing press briefing led by Johnson, said Smollett ""staged"" the attack as a ""publicity stunt,"" claiming the actor, 36, was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the Fox drama.

As to Smollett using the symbolism of a noose to make an alleged false accusation, Johnson told Roberts, ""The city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I'm acutely aware of that. But we didn't earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. I just want people to understand that's a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department. It's my responsibility to ensure the record gets set straight.""

He added, ""There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don't treat them with skepticism.""

The developing Smollett saga has captured the news cycle for weeks. After his arrest, the actor's salary motive has been questioned by those close to the Empire set, with star Terrence Howard coming to Smollett's public defense on Instagram. ""The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,"" Howard, who plays Smollett's onscreen father on Empire, wrote to a follower in the comments of his post. ""His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I've called my son for five years. It's God's job to judge and it's ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.""

Empire is set to return March 13 to Fox for the second half of its fifth season. The network has yet to make a decision on the show's future, though it's considered a safe bet for renewal."

She thought she would soon marry a man she adored, a welcome change after the messy and bitter divorce that ultimately cost her former husband his job as a speechwriter for President Trump.

Then some unwelcome news arrived from a courtroom on Cape Cod: A Massachusetts judge had ruled a $4 million defamation lawsuit filed against her last April by her ex-husband, David Sorensen, would be allowed to go to trial.

With a court battle looming, Corbett said, her fiance’s family wanted the couple to hit the brakes on the wedding. Feeling awful, she agreed.

Soon after, Corbett climbed into the bathtub in the Portland apartment she and her fiance shared and came down with what she called a panic attack.

“It all came to a head and I snapped,” Corbett said Monday. “I tried to kill myself. I took a whole lot of pills.”

For Corbett, 33, it was just one more moment in her long odyssey to escape a bad marriage and slip away from Sorensen for good. Had she followed the “silent underground railroad” that many women in her shoes take, she said, perhaps it would have gone better.

But when she chose to tell The Washington Post a year ago about her life with Sorensen, he quickly lost his White House position and began a public effort to clear his name by accusing Corbett of lying about their 2½-year marriage. During their time together, Sorensen served as a top aide to former Gov. Paul LePage while Corbett held a series of political positions.

Sorensen has repeatedly – and steadfastly – denied he was ever violent toward Corbett. Their rocky marriage, which included her throwing a diamond ring at him, ended in divorce in 2016.

“I have never been violent in any way toward any woman in my entire life,” Sorensen said Monday. “The thought of it disgusts me.”

For both of them, though, the trauma continues. Sorensen apparently hopes winning a defamation lawsuit will clear his name, while Corbett insists she already has lost everything but will not renounce the truth of their relationship.

Their split, Corbett said, “forced me to give up my life as I knew it,” leaving behind the political world in Augusta and most of the mutual friends she and Sorensen shared.

But when she found new love and got engaged at Christmas 2017, she thought she had moved past the trauma and hurt – until she had to call off wedding last July.

When Corbett gulped down pills three days before she had planned to wed, her fiance called 911 and sent her off to the hospital, where doctors kept her on a suicide watch and made sure she pulled through.

In the morning, physicians said she could go home. She phoned her fiance, who had promised to return to bring her home.

“I gotta go,” he told her before hanging up.

When the hospital released Corbett, she was surprised he was not there. So she took her purse, “just reeling and stunned,” and began walking home. Before too long, she thought to call an Uber.

When she arrived at their apartment, she immediately noticed that only one of two pairs of Bean boots sat outside the door. Inside, one dog barked – hers.

At that moment, “my heart shattered,” Corbett said.

“It was like the glass slipper broke,” Corbett said, her Cinderella period shattered for good.

When she finally got inside, she found he had taken all of his stuff and left. She never heard from him directly again.

Sorensen said he is “glad to learn her fiance escaped before she inflicted permanent damage on his life like she did on mine.

“Her life will improve only when she gets the help even her best friends say she needs, and when she stops seeking the attention she craves,” he said.

Corbett said that after the wedding fell through, she felt alone, but soon realized she was not.

Corbett said her friends in the neighborhood rallied to help, making sure she did not just spend her days crying. They got her food. They got her moving.

They helped find her a new apartment that turned out to be on her favorite block along Morning Street, where she had always hoped to live. They hired her to clean houses and Airbnb apartments.

“This community has been very kind to me,” Corbett said, reeling off the names of at least a dozen people who went out of their way to provide support when she was “hanging by a thread.”

But she had seen many others in far worse shape when she was volunteering at The Root Cellar, a privately funded community center that lends a hand to people in the area surrounding it on Washington Avenue. It helped her find perspective on her own woes.

Since last spring, Corbett has tried to stay out of the public eye, not venturing onto social media because she was sick of dealing with the trolls and feeling rattled from the constant pressure.

Then she learned Patrisha McLean, former wife of famed singer Don McLean, was creating an exhibition about domestic violence.

Inspired my McLean and fueled by “a puddle of tears,” Corbett said she decided to write up a brief account of her “life as it is today, laid bare” in a series of comments on Twitter last week.

At the end of that thread, she invited readers to donate to her legal defense fund, hoping she might raise a couple thousand dollars to fight Sorensen’s lawsuit.

Sorensen said Corbett “is turning to political activist strangers for help because people who know her don’t believe her. She is the female Jussie Smollett,” the actor who allegedly faked a racial attack in Chicago recently.

Corbett’s fundraiser did better than she expected.

By Monday afternoon, her post had been retweeted almost 5,000 times, including by some celebrities, and more than 700 people had chipped in more than $27,000, including Patrisha McLean.

Now, she said, she can defend herself in court and, with luck, fend off Sorensen’s case.

“He’s taken so much from me,” Corbett said. “He cannot take the truth.”

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical Left and Islamic terrorism.

“Why did Jussie Smollett do it?” a thousand anxiously clueless progressives ask.

To paraphrase Willie Sutton, because that’s where the money is.

Just ask Khalil Cavil, a Texas waiter, who raised a thousand bucks off a fake note that he wrote himself, ""We don't tip terrorist.""

""I want people to understand that this racism, and this hatred still exists,"" he claimed.

There have been multiple cases in recent years of waiters and waitresses faking racist notes and then scoring thousands in online donations for their pain and suffering before the hoax gets exposed.

A thousand bucks for a waiter equates to the millions that an actor hoped to make from a fake hate crime. The offense is the same, the social justice banks you’re robbing just get bigger for celebrities.

But so do the stakes.

Jussie Smollett’s mistake wasn’t faking a hate crime. It wasn’t even getting caught. (Most hate crime hoaxes are outed sooner or later.)

It was being stupid.

A waiter scrawling, “We Hate Black People” on a check, going to the media and then collecting donations is a lot safer than faking an assault in a city with more security cameras than ethics.

Jussie broke the first rule of hate crime hoaxes. He filed a police report. At that point the stunt he might have been able to pass off as a social justice art project became a crime.

That’s what he was arrested for.

College hate crime hoaxers usually don’t file police reports. If they do, it’s to the campus cops who generally do the first part of their job and discover it’s a hoax, and then do the second part of their job and cover it up. Local cops in campus towns also often shrug and the perps walk away with no charges.

Had Jussie Smollett staged a hate crime hoax at the University of Iowa, where a student claimed that he was assaulted by three white men shouting racial slurs, he would have also gotten a pass.

Marcus Owens, the students, faced no charges so that the “community can begin to heal”. The University statement said, “We will continue to reach out to everyone involved, including Marcus, in order to provide support and assistance.”

Iowa City police Capt. Troy Kelsay suggested that he hoped that Marcus ""learned a lesson from it.""

The lesson is obvious. Stage fake hate crimes in Iowa City. If you don’t get caught, you win. If you do get caught, nothing will happen to you.

Iowa City is 82% white and 5% black.

Capt. Troy Kelsay and Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness are extremely white and servicing an area that Hillary Clinton won by 65%. They know that their job is to condescendingly pat minority hate crime hoaxers on the head and thank them for starting an important conversation about racism.

Chicago is 45% white and 33% black. It has an actual police force with a history and an ethos that isn’t just there to pat drunken students on the head and keep the gownies away from the townies.

Worse still, for Jussie, it’s headed by Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson.

The worst possible place to fake a hate crime is in an African-American city. Black cops don’t suffer from white guilt and have very little patience for fake racist hate crimes. Chicago’s top law enforcement officials are African-American. That’s one reason Smollett is getting the book thrown at him.

He might have checked with Fynn Ajani Arthur at Goucher College who came down from Maine and decided to fake racist graffiti in Baltimore County. Artie blamed bottled up anger. The police charged him with property destruction and a hate crime.

Hate crime hoaxes are most likely to lead to criminal charges in more diverse areas with more professional police forces. If Jussie Smollett had wanted to successfully fake a hate crime, he should have gone to a lily-white leftist suburb with a police force whose main job is social justice.

The best place in America to fake a hate crime is still a campus. That’s why hate crime hoaxes occur most frequently on college campuses where they’re usually treated as victimless crimes.

Trying the same stunt in Chicago, New York or Baltimore is a bad idea.

The NYPD or the Chicago cops might not bother following up if your phone was stolen or if you were mugged on the way to work. But media coverage of a hate crime puts pressure on the cops to break the case. And they have the equipment and the training to solve the crime. They also have access to the ten trillion cameras dotting every city. And they’ll find the time to actually do more with that footage than just send out an alert with some blurry footage and move on to the next crime they don’t have time for.

And there’s nothing those cops, many of them minorities, hated more than knowing that they’re ignoring violent assaults by the dozen to pore over some celebrity’s minor assault that’s really a hoax.

The cops investigating Smollett’s lie knew exactly how many bleeding mugging victims sitting all night in an ER they had to brush off to figure out if someone had threatened a pampered celebrity.

They had a good idea from the start that it was a hoax. They were working the case to protect their own reputations, always endangered in a lefty activist city, and to nail the bastard who put them in that bind.

And they got their man.

It’s not surprising that a celebrity would have executed a hate crime hoax. The primary motivation for hate crime hoaxes is political narcissism. The average hate crime hoaxer is a college student in his late teens or early twenties whose campus radicalism and sense of alienation collide in self-dramatization.

The hate crime hoaxer has absorbed a social justice narrative in which his or her emotional insecurities are explained by microaggressions and institutional racism, whose heroes are activists who show their emotional resilience by fighting bigotry, and dramatizes his or her emotional reality with a hate crime.

The fake hate crime is the outcome of an internal conflict given a false political context by campus radicalization. Radical ideologies and cults structure individual emotional turmoil in terms of their own larger struggles. Emotionally unstable students are brainwashed to perceive their own conflicts as expressions of identity politics struggles against ‘whiteness’ or ‘heteronormativity’.

Jussie is over a decade older than the usual hate crime hoaxer, but he shared the political narcissism and the erratic emotions of the younger students who usually perpetrate these crimes.

But there’s also the financial angle.

Millennial hate crime hoaxes usually pay off most directly in the attention that the hoaxers both crave and dread. But millennials are also expert at monetizing attention, whether with GoFundMe fundraisers or job offers. Jussie Smollett’s hate crime followed the familiar millennial hate crime hoax pattern of monetizing attention with a media blitz. And in his business, celebrity, attention is money.

Just ask Colin Kaepernick.

Smollett’s mistake was forgetting that ‘hate crime’ has a crime in it. And an extremely unnecessary one.

In a social justice age of microaggressions and facecrimes where a lefty activist can gain nationwide fame for accusing a teenage boy in a red cap of smirking at him, an actual assault was never necessary.

Smollett’s error was the classic mistake of all bad actors. He overplayed the part.

All Jussie really had to do was track down a Trump supporter somewhere and claim that he was smirked at. The same media that spent tubs of ink analyzing the skin movements around the mouth area of a teenage Catholic boy at a pro-life rally would have been happy to anoint Jussie a victim of facecrime.

And who needs fake crimes when you have facecrimes?

Microaggressions make it possible to fake hate crimes that exist only in the perpetrator’s head. External evidence of political incorrectness, such as a MAGA hat or racial differences, do all the rest.

The best way to fake a hate crime isn’t with bleach and a noose. It’s to claim that the experience of the hate crime is “your truth”. That it exists not in the realm of fact and evidence that any professional police department can take apart in a matter of days, but in the orifices of your traumatized psyche.

There is no claim of emotional racial trauma too farfetched for the modern political establishment.

Under Obama, the National Park Service had hired an outreach guy who claimed that black people weren’t visiting parks because they have ancestral memories of being lynched on trees.

It’s stupid, but there’s no way short of common sense to actually disprove something in your head.

Actors may live in their heads, but celebrities, as Jussie Smollett aspired to be, live in front of mirrors. It wasn’t enough for him to invent a hate crime. As a method actor, he had to physically live it out. And, maybe, like method actors, once he experienced it, he was actually able to believe that it was true.

Leftists believe in lots of things that don’t exist and aren’t true. Like universal health care and green trains to Hawaii. They believe in them, as all cult members do, because they feel like the right thing.

And there’s no harm in believing stupid and wrong things, as long as you don’t try to make them real.

Jussie Smollett’s mistake, like that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, another millennial political narcissist, was trying to realize the fantasies that made him feel important. As long as his “truths” were inside his head, they couldn’t be challenged, and he could rant against President Trump all he liked.

Leftist problems begin when they try to realize their fantasies.

That’s what California found out with high speed rail, Vermont found out with socialized medicine and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez found out when the Green New Deal actually had to exist on paper.

Leftism is a beautiful fantasy that becomes a nightmarish reality. What starts out with equality, ends with gulags, what begins with a green vision becomes a war on cows, and what commences with a passionate cry for social justice ends with two Nigerians pouring bleach on you in Chicago.

Like the commissars of the Soviet Union, Noam Chomsky in Cambodia and Steven Spielberg in Cuba, Jussie Smollett had finally found a truth he could believe in, even as everyone else learned it was a lie."

According to Superintendent Eddie Johnson, there is mounting evidence that Smollett was fully responsible for staging a racist and homophobic ‘hate crime.’

“Let me just put this out there first and foremost right now that he still has the presumption of innocence until he has his day in court,” Johnson told host Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” Monday.

Foxnews.com reports: Johnson reiterated that Smollett, 36, described the Jan. 29 incident as a hate crime and that the Chicago police treated it as such. Johnson noted that even though the actor said his two alleged attackers were masked, Smollett “was able to say he’d seen around their eyes that at least one was white-skinned.”

“The entire time we investigated the incident he was treated like a victim,” Johnson added.

Smollett was charged Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct amid allegations of filing a false police report. He turned himself in at central booking early Thursday. If convicted, he is facing up to three years in prison. A judge set Smollett’s bond for $100,000 on Thursday.

Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and openly gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

It was after the police spoke with brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo that they pivoted their investigation away from a hate crime and to an allegedly false police report.

Johnson said that the Chicago police apprehended the brothers for 48 hours and that they became “cooperating witnesses” in the 47th hour, noting that authorities “gathered up a lot of evidence and facts before then.”

“We worked very closely with their lawyer,” Johnson told Roberts, explaining that the Osundairos’ attorney likely advised them on how to proceed with the police.

He maintained that the Chicago police were not out to get Smollett and sympathized with his plight at first, despite his story allegedly having holes.

“There were some questions [about the alleged hate crime Smollett initially reported], but there’s always questions when people are describing incidents to us,” Johnson said, adding, “We didn’t have the facts to support him being involved in it until that 47th hour.”

He said, “It’s not the Chicago police saying [the attack was staged], it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying it.”

The smoking gun, Johnson claims, was the Osundairo brothers presenting police with a check from Smollett.

“They said that he paid them $3,500 with a check … to carry out this incident,” he said.

Smollett’s legal team has maintained that the check was for personal training and nutrition services.

“The Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and I’m acutely aware of that,” Johnson admitted. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I refuse to let us take that shot if we have evidence of the contrary … [Filing a false report] is a dangerous thing to do to a city and to a police department. Something like this can be really damaging. We made a lot of progress in the last three years in terms of race relations … I just hope people dont judge other people that are victims of these types of crimes.”

He added, “There are real victims of hate crimes and I just hope that people don’t treat them with skepticism.”

Johnson said that the investigation is ongoing.

“[Smollett] still has a presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route,” Johnson said. “There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Chicago police also accused Smollett of sending himself hate mail to the “Empire” set. The FBI is investigating the letter, which was reportedly laced with an innocuous white powder and “MAGA” messages. If convicted of mail fraud, Smollett could face up to 10 years behind bars.

Last week, Johnson slammed Smollett in a press conference.

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why,” an emotional Johnson said. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol…how can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city by making this false claim?” He added, “Bogus police reports cause real harm.”

Smollett’s attorneys previously told Fox News they’ve “witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

A judge in the US has set R Kelly's bail at $1m (£766,500) after the singer was charged with sexually abuses on four females, including three minors.

The R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced decades of sexual abuse claims.

He has never been convicted and has previously denied other allegations.

He turned himself in on Friday after an arrest warrant was issued. Even though bail was set at $1m, he will have to post $100,000 to secure his release.

Video: The singer turned himself in, to the police

He has been ordered to surrender his passport and to have no contact with anyone under the age of 18.

The 52-year-old's court appearance comes just weeks after a documentary series called Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained decades of allegations of abuse against him from many women, including the singer's ex-wife.

The judge chairing Saturday's hearing was John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, who presided over last week's bail hearing for actor Jussie Smollett.

The actor is accused of staging a hoax hate crime against himself.

What are the allegations?

Kelly appeared in court on Saturday afternoon and faces 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Prosecutors said that one of the cases relates to footage showing Kelly engaging in sex with a 14-year-old girl, according to the Associated Press. Kelly was previously acquitted over another video tape of a similar nature in 2008.

Kelly met another of the four girls, who was 16 at the time, when she asked for the singer's autograph during the same trial.

Another accuser met Kelly at a restaurant as she celebrated her 16th birthday.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx previously said the singer could face a maximum of seven years in prison for each count.

What is R Kelly's history?

Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about sexual and physical abuse for decades.

In 1994 it was reported he married 15-year-old singer and musical protégé Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago when he was 27. US media said she had lied about her age on the certificate, and the marriage was later annulled.

In 2002 the star was charged with child pornography in Chicago over footage that appeared to show him engaging in intercourse, oral sex, urination, and other sexual acts with a girl said to be 13 or 14.

The case took six years to go to trial. Both Kelly and the girl alleged to be in the video denied it was them. Eventually the jury acquitted Kelly of all 14 charges against him.

In 2017, Kelly was forced to deny allegations that he was holding a number of young women captive in a so-called ""abusive cult"" after a bombshell report from BuzzFeed News.

He has also been sued privately by a number of women, including some who allege underage sexual relationships and another who says he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease.

The singer has continued to make music throughout the allegations.

There have been calls to boycott Kelly's music - both recordings and performances - with people using the social media hashtag #MuteRKelly.

Ms Foxx had urged women to come forward after the documentary series aired.

E-Mail Her At Szito Tribweb.Com'],https://assets.realclear.com/images/47/472598_5_.jpg,"['water', 'right', 'national', 'carried', 'weigel', 'relationships', 'reporters', 'media', 'reporter', 'organizations', 'need', 'smollett', 'local', 'jussie']","CHICAGO -- The first thing that caused newsman Rafer Weigel to blink when reading the TMZ report on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett being brutally attacked by Trump-supporting, noose-wielding, racial-slurring assailants was the neighborhood in which the attack was reported to have happened.

The Streeterville neighborhood is not exactly ""MAGA country"" at any time, let alone 2 a.m.

""It is our job as reporters to be skeptical,"" said Weigel, a local Fox affiliate news anchor and reporter who grew up in Chicago.

How skeptical? ""Well as the old adage goes, 'If your mother says she loves you, check it out,' so from the get go, when we heard this about Smollett, there were eyebrows raised for a whole host of reasons, just because we know the city well,"" he said.

As national media often omitted ""alleged"" from their reporting of the attack and instead saying that Smollett was attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing people who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"" and ""poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim,"" the newsroom Weigel works in, along with several other competing Chicago print and media organizations, mostly stuck ""alleged"" in their reporting.

Local news organizations were doing what local news organizations do best: staying in constant contact with the local police, local officials and the community, and pursing the past behavior of the victim to look for additional red flags before going in head first with a narrative.

A news organization's relationship with the police, local officials and the community is critical, Weigel said, explaining that as a local news reporter, you often have to report on things that aren't favorable to the community or a local official or the police force. ""But because you build trust by being honest and not sensational, those relationships remain intact,"" he said.

Weigel said the newsroom worked as a team, with people working the phones and talking to detectives in person, often receiving certain information off the record that the detectives would not share with the public because it could compromise their investigation. ""So we honor that in order to keep that relationship open."" He added: ""We have to have good relationships with police officers and local officials, or they will completely cut us off. It is a two-way street. If they have a crime that needs to get solved, they'll turn to us to bring awareness to it, to get out suspects' pictures and videos and that sort of thing. If there's a high-profile case that's of high interest to the public, they understand that, and they will tell us what we can, or what they can, without compromising the investigation. So, it is a two-way street.""

As any good local news reporter knows, those working relationships are critical. At the same time, it doesn't mean reporters don't hold them accountable. When there was evidence of a police cover-up of the 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald by a police officer, the local Chicago media broke the story. The officers involved ended up going to trial. While they were acquitted, the police understand reporters have a job to do. As Weigel said: ""We work in close proximity with these people. We know them by their first name, and so therefore, the local media will always have an advantage over the national media swooping in at the last minute, because we already know these people.""

National news organizations, the ones with the most Twitter followers or influence on social media, cannot possibly work those kinds of relationships in a meaningful way. But many of them let the story stand without using ""alleged"" in their reporting, often retweeting celebrities, presidential candidates and influencers who personally condemn the attack, rather than prefacing the attack as an alleged attack.

That kind of omission, including any inference used in the delivery of a story, is damaging to our credibility as dispassionate deliverers of the news.

That behavior is not one a local news reporter can entertain.

On a national level, it took seconds for the story to become that Smollett was a victim of a hate crime, and that once again, supporters of President Trump are racist homophobes who are out for blood. It just stood there for weeks, getting spread by Hollywood, social media and conversations offline. Like so many other false stories recklessly spread, it became an axiom.

Except it wasn't.

The most important lesson of this debacle is not that national news is bad but that local news matters at the very same time it is dying.

It is a death that does no one good, certainly not the cities and towns and municipalities that need someone holding their water authorities, school boards, police officers, mayors and city councils in check.

We need them to cover the abuses of power, corruption, and dark secrets and associations that lurk in their past. We need them to follow the money.

Newsroom employment across the country has bottomed out at local newspapers, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics. Its survey data shows a 23 percent job loss in local news from 2008 to 2017.

We need more reporters like Rafer Weigel. We need more reporters like the ones I used to work with in Pittsburgh. But there is no quick fix, or perhaps any fix, to this crisis. Technology has changed the media industry.

Like any industry changed by automation, the horse is out of the barn.

According to an incident report, 58-year-old Nathaniel Rhodes reportedly ran a red light and was then hit by a pickup truck in the intersection Coming Street and Highway 17 on Aug. 12, 2018. When officer Paul Kelly spotted a bottle of wine that was one-third full, Rhodes reportedly admitted that he had been drinking from it “about three hours ago.”

Rhodes was then asked to take a field sobriety test after EMS advised that “there was no reason he had to remain in the stretcher,” according to the report. Rhodes failed and was taken to the police station for a Datamaster test.

“On entering the station, the driver fell to the ground and reported that he was experiencing physical distress, at which point, officers called EMS and he was transported to a local hospital, where he died four days later,” police said Friday.

According to attorney Justin Bamberg, who is representing Rhodes’ widow Annette and daughter Megan Johnson, Rhodes suffered eight broken ribs and a ruptured liver from the accident.

The New York Post notes that videos of the incident were deleted or “lost.”

Bamberg, who is also a S.C. House representative, agrees with attorney Christy Fargnoli that the first responders violated procedure by allowing the officer to remove Rhodes out of care and take him into custody.

“At the point in which Mr. Rhodes was in the custody of EMS and requested transport, it was completely inappropriate of them to allow the officer to sign him out and to allow them to refuse the medical treatment,” Fargnoli said. “That was a non-delegable duty that EMS had, and they breached it.”

Rhodes relatives are now demanding an investigation be launched to determine if proper protocol was followed.

“The family alleges that poisonous toxins could have been flooding his bloodstream while he sat at the police station,” attorneys said. “By the time Rhodes was actually transported to the hospital, it was too late.”"

CHICAGO — A Chicago judge says ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he's free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's attorneys, who say he's innocent.

Kavanagh says attorney Mark Geragos, who's based in Los Angeles, is Smollett's lead attorney. She says a defense lawyer asked Monday that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett, who is black and gay, staged a racist and homophobic attack, then told police his attackers yelled racial and anti-gay slurs and referenced President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport."

In the West, we’re not merely living at present through savage culture wars. We’re not merely experiencing a terrifying eruption of anti-Semitism in supposedly civilized countries. We are being subjected to a manipulation of reality that could have been scripted by Franz Kafka.

The gay, black actor Jussie Smollett claimed that he was set upon in Chicago, after buying a sandwich in the middle of a pulverizingly cold night last month, by attackers who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, shouted “this is MAGA country,” poured an unknown chemical over him and placed a noose around his neck.

This bizarre account was then said to have been a hoax, with Smollett reportedly having paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him. He denied this; but now he has been charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.

A lot of people now find themselves under an uncomfortable spotlight.

From the start, it was clear that Smollett’s story was far-fetched and inconsistent. Yet it was instantly leapt upon as unchallengeably true.

Democrat presidential hopeful Cory Booker tweeted that it was “an attempted modern-day lynching.” The Washington Post’s “identity politics” reporter Eugene Scott wrote that Smollett’s “experience” was “far too common for black gay men, particularly those who speak out against racism and sexism.”

Others said it showed the ugly truth of U.S. President Trump’s America. Actress Ellen Page urged people to “connect the dots,” accusing Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of hating gay people and wanting to cause them suffering.

Anyone who questioned Smollett’s story was denounced as a hate-monger.

The truth of this episode has yet to be resolved. Yet more broadly, there has been a huge number of hoaxes and fraudulent claims about hate crimes that have been seized upon as true despite clear evidence to the contrary.

Last September, Christine Blasey Ford could recall few of the circumstances surrounding the sexual assault she said to have endured as a teenager at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, who was being nominated as a justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee found not enough evidence for her claim.

Yet despite this, her story was not only widely believed, but anyone who questioned it was accused of endorsing male violence against women.

Last month, as a result of selectively edited video footage, boys from Covington Catholic High School demonstrating against abortion and wearing MAGA caps were accused of racially abusing an elderly Native American. The boys were subjected to hate campaigns; the school even had to close for a day following the incident. When the full video was revealed, however, the boys were found to have been themselves the victims of abuse and intimidation by another group on the scene.

And let’s not overlook the unprecedented attempt to prove that Trump had colluded with Russia to “steal” the presidential election he subsequently won.

Not only has no such evidence at all been discovered. Evidence has steadily emerged that elements of the FBI and Justice Department and other officials used the Hillary Clinton campaign’s opposition “research” to mount an unlawful spying operation on team Trump in order to abort his presidency.

The former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was fired last year after being said by the Inspector General to have “lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions,” has now claimed in a book and associated interviews that he plotted with others in the FBI to remove the president by any means necessary.

These astounding claims have been largely pooh-poohed or ignored. For as with many left-wing causes, factual evidence is dismissed as irrelevant.

This is because whichever issue underpins the left’s uproar of the day constitutes a “fact” that is as incontrovertible as a papal bull under the medieval Inquisition.

So Blasey Ford had to be believed because of the incontrovertible “fact” that Kavanaugh was anti-abortion and therefore had to be stopped at all costs from being appointed to the Supreme Court.

The Covington boys had to be abusers because of the incontrovertible “fact” that Trump supporters in MAGA caps go out looking for minorities to beat up.

Even now, McCabe is still claiming with no evidence whatever that it’s possible that Trump is a Russian asset.

Asked about the claims that the Smollett story was a hoax, Booker doubled down. “Bigoted and biased attacks” were seriously on the rise, he said, and most terrorist attacks since 9/11 had been “right-wing,” a majority of them “white supremacist attacks.” So he avoided the issue of truth and swerved back instead to his overriding agenda: bashing the right.

Meanwhile, real attacks on Jews are being ignored. On the night that Smollett claimed he was attacked, a Jewish man in New York was beaten up by three thugs.

The NYPD reports that more than twice as many hate crimes—most of them against Jews—occurred last month as in January last year. Last October, The New York Times reported there had been four times as many crimes against Jews as against black people, while anti-Jewish hate crimes outnumbered those against transgender people by a factor of 20.

This receives virtually no attention. That’s because anti-Semitism is a bigotry that’s prevalent on the left and among the groups it favors. So it gets in the way of the narrative that reframes reality to accord with left-wing shibboleths.

Such falsifications are justified on the grounds that they illustrate a “broader truth.” But they are in fact lies.

And the really mind-bending thing is that these are deployed to demonstrate the user’s moral superiority. For many on the left create right-wing monsters merely to prove their own virtue and make themselves unchallengeable.

That’s why Washington Post editorial board assistant Nana Efua Mumford said she was broken-hearted to discover the Smollett story was almost certainly a hoax.

“The incident,” she mourned, “would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ‘fake news.’ And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true … ”

And it’s why American Jews who vote Democrat are muted or silent about the virulent anti-Semitism of people like Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan or Democrat congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Having told themselves falsely that Trump is a mortal threat to Jews, black people or Muslims, they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that the most dangerous enemies of the Jewish people are on their own side—and that it’s Trump who is their target, not the other way round.

Hoaxes are a kind of false flag operation to cast as villains the victims of such attacks. They are a hallmark of Soviet communism’s strategy of psychological warfare in creating a looking-glass world where nothing is what it seems.

Israel is a prime victim of this hoax politics. The whole Palestinian narrative—cooked up originally by Yasser Arafat in cahoots with the former Soviet Union—is a false flag operation, a hoax that falsely blames its Israeli victim of appalling crimes of which it is innocent but of which the Palestinian perpetrator is itself guilty.

Hoax politics is an example of cultural totalitarianism that fries the brain and creates a climate of political, intellectual and moral chaos.

It’s why so many of us feel that the world has spun off its axis of reason altogether. And it’s why the whole anti-Israel and anti-Jew pathology that has erupted in the West is part of a broader and devastating cultural nervous breakdown."

According to Univision, ""Maduro ended the interview after Ramos showed him a video of youths picking through garbage in the streets. After Maduro left his staff seized the video and Univision equipment, including TV and phones."" After about two and a half hours in a dark room, Ramos and his team were released.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an exclusive interview that aired during Monday’s edition of World News Tonight, ABC correspondent and weekend anchor Tom Llamas sat down with Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro in his presidential palace. At no point during the shared moments of Maduro’s incessant anti-U.S. bashing did Llamas push back or grill him on what he was saying. Instead, ABC eagerly spread Maduro’s anti-U.S./Trump sentiment without fact-checks or contradictions. Llamas even seemed to suggest that President Trump was the problem.

“Tonight, in a rare interview inside of his presidential palace, Nicolas Maduro telling ABC News he believes the U.S. is preparing a military invasion to get him out,” Llamas declared after brushing over Maduro’s regime setting aid trucks on fire.

Throughout the report, Maduro made numerous false and conspiratorial statements without an apparent fact-check or contraction from Llamas, even during his voice-over narrations recorded after the fact:

NICOLAS MADURO (via translator): The United States wants Venezuela’s oil and they're having to go to war for that oil. LLAMAS: And today, Vice President Mike Pence in Colombia to meet with Venezuela's interim president, Juan Guaido, and other South American leaders opposed to Maduro. MADURO: Everything that the United States government has done has been condemned. They're trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America. LLAMAS: But Maduro refusing to budge. He says Guaido is a puppet of the United States and that his country will not beg for the U.S. help. MADURO: Our movement came from the depths of the Venezuelan people. We've been governing democratically for 20 years. Everything that we are, everything that we have, we have because of the popular vote.

First off, Llamas failed to rebuke Maduro’s claims that the U.S. wanted to invade Venezuela for its oil. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, “The United States is now the largest global crude oil producer in the world.” It was even a point brought up during President Trump’s State of the Union address earlier this month.

It’s mind-boggling that Llamas wouldn’t report that the U.S.’s stance against Maduro’s regime had actually been backed up by many world powers, who also recognized interim-President Juan Guaido as the rightful leader. And while Maduro asserted his country has had free and fair elections for “20 years,” Llamas failed to point out how those same powers viewed the last (and many) Venezuelan elections as illegitimate.

As he was wrapping up his segment, Llamas pressed how Maduro really wanted to speak with Trump to educate him about Venezuela. The ABC reporter then seemed to suggest President Trump was the problem:

David, we wrapped up that sit-down interview just moments ago, and President Maduro made it very clear, he wants to talk to President Trump, he wants to shake his hand and tell him he's confused about Venezuela. The problem is, the Trump administration has made it clear, they do not want to negotiate with him.

This ridiculous interview came almost two weeks after ABC’s softball interview between Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts and alleged hoaxer Jussie Smollett, which begs the question: Does ABC know how to conduct a serious and critical interview?

TMZ reports that according to people on the set, Howard was furious over the situation and refused to come out of his trailer for most of the day on Thursday after Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police.

The site adds that Howard didn’t believe Smollett’s story from early on, feeling it didn’t all add up. He reportedly questioned Smollett about the story semi-regularly as holes began to appear in the story. The tension between the two hit a pitch after Abel and Ola Osundario, the brothers who allegedly helped stage the attack, were arrested. Howard apparently confronted Smollett and screamed at him to come forward with the truth.

Howard was also specifically not on set when Smollett spoke with the cast and crew, maintaining his innocence. Many others also felt Smollett was lying, which is why producers chose to remove the actor from the final two episodes of the season.

However, Howard also posted a video on Saturday that seemed to support Smollett, which featured the latter playing with Howard’s son and a caption which read, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you.”"

After she reported the fire, the FBI investigated it as a hate crime, but police smelled a rat and the state prosecutor charged the woman with first-degree arson.

In the wake of the hate hoax perpetrated by Empire star Jussie Smollett, the Michigan arson case has gained renewed attention. Elmer Hitt, director of police and fire services for Jackson, told PJ Media the trial is pending.

Nikki Joly, 54, was born a woman but identifies as a man. She pressured the city council to pass a non-discrimination ordinance in February 2017 and led the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival.

She was arrested in September 2018 and charged with one felony count of first-degree arson. Police arrested her more than one year after the fire on August 10, 2017. The fire burned down her house, killing her two German shepherds and three cats.

Police first interviewed Robert Tulloch, who had written an email to the city damager and city council objecting to the city raising a rainbow flag at a park for the gay pride festival. “That is an in your face declaration of war and will be met with a violent response,” Tulloch had written. This letter came two weeks before the fire, The Detroit News reported.

Tulloch had an alibi, however. He was making a deposit at a bank drive-thru, which was confirmed by the police investigator. “It was orchestrated. They wanted to find someone to blame,” Tulloch told The Detroit News.

Nikki Joly did not have a good alibi. According to the police report, she got a call from Chris Moore, her girlfriend, at about 1:02 p.m. on August 10. Moore had forgotten to pack her lunch, so she asked Joly to bring it to work. Joly returned home, went inside for a few minutes, and left.

Neighbors reported the fire at 1:16 p.m. This sequence of events made it extremely unlikely that anyone other than Joly had started the fire, police detective Aaron Grove wrote in his report.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire, and then leave without being scene [sic],” Grove wrote, The Detroit News reported.

Joly told an insurance company investigator the arsonist must have been in her home at the same time she was. Police lab tests found traces of gasoline on the clothes she was wearing on the day of the fire.

Two weeks after the incident, a city police detective and two FBI agents interviewed Nikki Joly for four hours. According to the police report, she drooped her head during the interview, staring at the floor. She didn’t admit setting the fire, but did not deny it, either.

The first-degree arson charge Joly faces is punishable by up to life in prison and/or a fine of not more than $20,000 or three times the value of the property destroyed, whichever is greater, MLive reported. Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Steve Idema said Joly is guaranteed a prison sentence if she is convicted of the charges.

After the fire, St. John’s United Church of Christ, which hosted the Jackson Pride Center, rushed to raise money for Joly and Moore. According to The Detroit News, the church aimed to raise $10,000 but quickly surpassed that amount. St. John’s and other organizations raised $58,000 for the couple.

While Joly’s attorney insisted that there was no motive for the transgender activist to burn down her house and kill her pets, people who worked with Joly at St. Johns suggested a motive.

Barbara Shelton and Bobby James, two church officials, said Nikki Joly had been frustrated that the controversy over gay rights had died down after the passage of the nondiscrimination law. They also said Joly was disappointed that the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, which took place five days before the fire, had not received more attention or protests.

Nikki Joly indeed received attention after the fire. In addition to the money raised on her behalf, she gained notoriety when a local paper named her “Citizen of the Year.”

Like the Jussie Smollett case, it seems Nikki Joly may have orchestrated the hate hoax to draw attention to herself and her issues. When everyone is competing to be the most interesting victim, it stands to reason an activist might victimize herself, even if it means burning down her house and killing her pets.

In two recent why-dunits, the curious have wondered why: (1) a successful TV star would allegedly orchestrate a fake, hate-inspired attack on himself, and (2) a Coast Guard officer would allegedly plot a mass-murder attack on American Democrats and journalists.

In the first instance, prosecutors say that actor Jussie Smollett last month paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack, tie a noose around his neck, douse him with bleach, and shout, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor, who is gay, and his alleged pretend-assailants, are all black. But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired — by Smollett.

If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged for disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a Ronald Reagan phrase that was commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag is in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed — at least by many in the pitchfork media — because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

Yet, a more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay — and in the name of Donald Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Mass., for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, last week, a California high-school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

On a far-more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested last week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people — and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion — it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, yet the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated three-decade military servicemember, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court yet never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grownups are so upset about it.

Johnson told Roberts that he is out speaking about the case because he wants to make sure the public knows the full details of the case because of the sensitivity of many issues surrounding law enforcement and racism: “The city of Chicago has its issues, the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that. But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. So I just want people to understand that it’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department, so it’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight.”

Roberts asked Johnson about the $3,500 check made out to Smollett that was revealed to have a notation that it was for training.

Johnson offered no specificity that would answer questions about the check, but simply repeated that the brothers told police they were paid $3,500 to carry out the attack.

Asked about the passionate press conference he gave last week, Johnson replied: “I hope people don’t judge other folks that are victims of these types of crime. This is just one particular incident, and that’s the damaging part of it. You damage a city’s reputation where we don’t need help with that. There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope that people don’t treat them with skepticism.”

Johnson reiterated something he said at last week’s press conference, that the investigation only turned at the last minute because the brothers’ attorney convinced them to tell the truth: “We didn’t have the facts to support him being involved in it until that 47th hour, and it’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago police saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

Johnson stood by the department’s handling of the case, adding, “There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that does not support the version he gave…There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”"

As if they ever were granted great credibility in any capacity of the justice system. SiriusXM radio host Clay Cane, who recently wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post on this very issue, recently – and smoothly – explained that historical fact, yet conservative commentator S.E. Cupp found a way to make it about white women.

Friday, Feb. 22 on CNN, Cane was asked his response to the Chicago police superintendent saying that because of Smollett it will be harder for hate crime victims be believed.

“Because of Jussie Smollett — the one Black gay guy who may have lied — victims of hate crimes are not going to be believed?” Cane asked incredulously. “We already aren’t believed. If someone doesn’t believe a hate crime victim they didn’t believe them before Jussie.”

Cane continued: “But here is the larger point, why doesn’t it work the other way around? Why is it when white people falsely accuse Black people, and there’s a documented history of that, how come their credibility isn’t shot? How come the credibility of white women, for example, you think about Carolyn Bryant, Susan Smith, and most recently, Kristen Rhimes. Their credibility isn’t shot but the one Black person who has allegedly lied it’s somehow going to ruin the lives of Black LGBT folks who are affected by hate crimes? That is really a ridiculous, offensive perspective. As a Black LGBT person, I can tell you it’s not true.”

With Cupp’s face twisting, she turned the conversation to white women. “As a woman,” she began, “let me just say, we are also not believed. Whether it’s as victims of sexual harassment or sex crimes, all kinds of crimes, we are also not believed.”

Cane interjected and said, “But I am talking about race.”

Ignoring that Cane’s comment, Cupp kept going, insisting that, “We are also not believed routinely.”

Cane rebutted with, “I just want to point out that we are talking about race. We are on Black History Month, right? There is a long, documented history of white people falsely accusing Black people. As far as women, within white people, that’s different. There is a long history so all that I am saying, if it’s going to damage the credibility, you would think it would be across the board.”

Watch the clip below:

Talking the history of whites falsely accusing blacks & it goes right back to white women. Google Fannie Taylor, Charles Stuart, Teresa Klein or ""whites falsely accusing blacks"" for stats. It's not personal, it's facts. Oh – Emmett Till should be 77. Happy Black History Month. pic.twitter.com/IkaE85hJ2D — Clay Cane (@claycane) February 25, 2019

In case you didn’t know, on August 28, 1955, Carolyn Bryant Donham, a White woman, told a lie that got a 14-year-old Emmett Till lynched. In 2017, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” a book by Timothy Tyson, claims that Carolyn Bryant Donham admitted to lying about Till whistling at her.

In 1994, Susan Smith claimed a Black man kidnapped her kids and manhunt ensued. In reality, she drowned her children and is up for probation in five years. South Carolina woman Kristen Rimes said she was attacked by a Black man last year, which was a lie. This isn’t even scratching the surface.

Also, a 2017 report stated, “As of October 15, 2016, the National Registry of Exonerations listed 1,900 defendants who were convicted of crimes and later exonerated because they were innocent; 47% of them were African Americans, three times their rate in the population.”

How bizarre that a simple fact made S.E. Cupp so frantic that she resorted to rambling about white women. There is only one thing left to say:

The niece of the black pianist depicted in the Oscar winning Green Book has described the celebration of the movie as 'a shame,' and shared her belief that director Peter Farrelly 'took a jab' at her father during his acceptance speech.

Speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com Karole, 47, said, 'I wholeheartedly believe that Peter Farrelly took a jab at my father in his speech.

'He said there's this saying, 'If you want to go fast go alone. If you want to go far go together.'

'That is actually an African proverb that my father learned from my grandfather. My father has said it many times now publicly in the context of how this movie got there quickly because they did not consult anyone who was family.

'There's a depth and nuance they could have got from consulting family but they never did.'

The brother of Dr Donald Shirley (pictured), the black pianist featured in the Oscar-nominated Green Book, slammed it as a 'shameful travesty', Maurice Shirley tells DailyMailTV from his Milwaukee home

Shirley's family doesn't believe that any attempt was made to find or contact them, nor do they believe writer Nick Vallelonga's assertion that he and his father visited Shirley before his death in 2013 and were granted permission to tell the story. Pictured: Shirley plays the piano in an artist's studio above Carnegie Hall, New York, 1960

The movie billed as a heartwarming tale of the unlikely friendship between the black pianist and his Italian American driver, garnered three awards including the coveted Best Picture as well as Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali and Best Original Screenplay.

But it has been increasingly mired in controversy with allegations of stereotyping black characters and riding roughshod over Shirley's surviving family and the truth.

Last month DailyMail.com exclusively revealed how Shirley's own family dismissed the movie as a 'culturally tone deaf… symphony of lies.'

According to Dr Shirley's surviving brother, Maurice, 82, and his wife Patricia, 79, there was no friendship between the pianist and his overtly racist driver Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga.

Karole said that her father went to bed rather than watching the ceremony and that as she did her first concern was how he would feel this morning when he woke to learn about Farrelly's remarks.

She said, 'He is wearied by the whole thing. Both he and my mother said that for the movie to win was a 'shame.''

'They both grew up coming out of Jim Crow and went through that awful time and fight for civil rights.

'So when they say something is a shame that's saying something.'

Karole went on, 'For him to take a jab like that when they have never got in touch, never apologized….This man lacks character and honor.

'Oscars aside I think he has sealed his fate with the lies he has told, the corners he has cut. That will be the benchmark of his career.'

Karole was also cast doubt on Vallelonga's son, screenwriter Nick Vallelonga's claims that he had not known of her or her parents and any of the multiple other surviving relatives' existence.

She said, 'We're not hard to find. He could have Googled us and found us. How do you not know?'

She added that her family accepted that the movie was an entertaining fiction. But said that it was an example of Hollywood playing lip service to racial equity, 'To think that this is presented as a heartwarming friendship when a man [Vallelonga] goes from being a hateful racist to tolerant of one black man! As long as you throw awards at something like that nothing will change.'

The movie focuses on a tour of the segregated south undertaken by Shirley at the height of the Jim Crow era in 1962.

Written by Nick Vallelonga, it charts the supposed friendship that grew between Shirley and the screenwriter's father Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga.

But in January, Maurice slammed the movie, for which no family members were consulted, as 'a symphony of lies.'

Shirley's family, speaking out that the movie, billed as a heartwarming tale of the unlikely friendship between the black pianist and an Italian American who was briefly his driver, is nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor and Supporting Actor

In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Shirley's last surviving brother, Maurice, 82, (pictured with his wife Patricia at their Milwaukee home) has slammed the movie, for which no family members were consulted, as 'a symphony of lies'

From the teal blue car that Vallelonga drove when Shirley only rode in a black limousine; to the Cutty Sark whisky he requests when he only drank Chivas Regal or Haig and Haig; to the presentation of him as a man disconnected from his family and isolated from the black community, Maurice has told of the movie's litany of errors.

And he has disclosed his extraordinary conversation with Mahershala Ali- nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Shirley and the sole member of cast or crew to reach out to the family on learning of their push-back after the movie's release.

Speaking alongside his wife, Patricia, 79, and daughter Karole, 47, from the family home in Milwaukee, Maurice said: 'It was a telephone call. I took the position of being supportive of his sincerity. Neither my wife nor I are against Mahershala. I told him that he's just been duped.'

According to Patricia: 'I think it was an extremely gracious, generous move on his part to acknowledge to Donald's family that perhaps he had not done his due diligence in terms of meeting by phone or email or otherwise to get a keener sense of who this man was.

'I felt his apology was sincere and he explained that he had not been aware of the existence of as much family and had he been he would have done differently than he did.'

Maurice added: 'I hold no grudge against Mahershala.'

But the family does hold a grudge against the movie makers.

They do not believe that any attempt was made to find or contact them, nor do they believe Nick Vallelonga's assertion that he and his father visited Shirley before his death in 2013 and were granted permission to tell the story.

Maurice said: 'My brother made it very clear that under no circumstances did he [give permission]. My brother was compulsive. If he did not have control he wouldn't have anything to do with it.

'I recall the conversation that we had with Donald at which time he said that Tony had put together his memoir… and wanted to publish it. It was very clear that it would not be done particularly well.'

Written by Nick Vallelonga, the movie charts the supposed friendship that grew between Shirley and the screenwriter's father Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (pictured together in November 2008)

Maurice disclosed his conversation with Mahershala Ali (pictured receiving a Golden Globe, left, and Oscar, right), who was the sole member of cast or crew to reach out to the family on learning of their push-back after the movie's release

Shirley and Vallelonga were never friends, according to his brother, so any talk of friendship is 'bogus.'

Maurice said: 'You have to understand my brother's work ethic. He always made it clear to his employees just exactly what they were. They are employees. He is the employer.'

He described the idea that Vallelonga - an overt racist who is shown putting glasses in the trash after two African American workmen drink lemonade from them - became close to his brother as quite simply 'a lie.'

Not only were they not friends, Shirley fired the driver for some of the behaviors shown in the movie such as his refusal to carry Shirley's luggage, open his car door or wear a uniform.

He said: 'Anybody who knows my brother knows that none of his chauffeurs lasted 18 months [as the movie claims]. He had quite a temper.'

There was very little contact [between Donald and his drivers]...on the road the role was something you could describe now as a valet but not a road dog, not a friend.

Patricia said: 'There was very little contact [between Donald and his drivers]. He very often met their family but not in such an intimate setting as their home and on the road the role was something you could describe now as a valet but not a road dog, not a friend.'

In fact Shirley was so particular about his distinction between personal and business that, Maurice revealed, it applied to his own sibling.

In a scene not dissimilar to the closing ones of Green Book in which Vallelonga and Shirley battle through blizzard conditions to get back to New York for Christmas Eve, Maurice once drove his brother through the night in a snowstorm from Syracuse where he had been performing to his next concert in Milwaukee.

He recalled how his brother made him wear a uniform, how they drove without a break and how, as he struggled onwards Shirley raised the limousine's privacy screen and drew the curtain between them.

'I was mad,' Maurice laughed. 'But that's how he was, even as a family member if you were in a professional role that was the relationship.'

In the movie Shirley is cast as an isolated figure who has no contact with his family.

Yet the tables and walls in the front room of Maurice and Patricia's Milwaukee home are crowded with family photographs - proof of a lifetime's closeness and the 'tight' family of which Shirley was an integral part.

Shirley was nine years old when Maurice was born to Rev Edwin S Shirley and Stella Young Shirley. The couple already had two sons, Hilton, then almost 15 and Edwin Jr, 13.

After the death of their mother, Maurice said 'Donald became my mother. In fact he made a point even in my maturity in later years [to remind me] that he fed me, he bathed me, he changed my diapers because my other two brothers were at school. That close bond we had from when we were young to when we were adults has never left me.' Pictured l-r: Donald's nephew Maurice Jr, Donald and Maurice Sr Shirley in Nashville

But Stella Shirley died from birth complications within two days of her youngest son's arrival. It was a tragedy that shifted the family dynamics and defined Maurice's relationship with his closest sibling.

Maurice said: 'Donald became my mother. In fact he made a point even in my maturity in later years [to remind me] that he fed me, he bathed me, he changed my diapers because my other two brothers were at school. That close bond we had from when we were young to when we were adults has never left me.'

When Maurice asked Patricia to marry him there was no question in his mind that Shirley would be his Best Man.

Shirley threw the couple an engagement party on New Year's Eve in 1963 - just one year after the Green Book tour - in his New York apartment above Carnegie Hall.

Patricia said: 'To me family is always just at the root of everything that we do.

'Donald was not only very, very much in communication and in touch with his family but he was very, very close with my family because of their being in Pensacola and my family was from Mobile, which was just 69 miles away.

'Donald remembered our family anywhere he was, he always made contact with them, had dinner with them, having them attend his concert performances.

'He was not at all as the movie would portray estranged from any of his family, my family or the friends he had over the years. He was by no means isolated from anybody he cared anything about.'

Shirley's niece Karole, recalled him as 'a formidable presence within the family.' He never missed a birthday, an anniversary or a significant date in her childhood and youth - or those of her siblings Desiree, now 61, Maureen, 52 or Maurice Jr, 43.

He played at her cotillion when she was 15 years old and she recalled: 'He used to call me when I was at university and play my favorite music. It was Rachmaninoff. He played it with such ease. He would play it for me and my sister Maureen and we would listen and just be transported to a different place.'

For Karole, so close to her uncle until his death in 2013, it has been painful to see the impact Green Book's release has had on her parents.

Maurice's wife Patricia said: 'He was not at all as the movie would portray estranged from any of his family, my family or the friends he had over the years. He was by no means isolated from anybody he cared anything about.' Pictured: Dr Donald Shirely in the hotel suite of his niece Karole Shirley at her debutante ball, November 1988

She said: 'The impact on [my father] is really difficult. He and my uncle Donald were very close so I can see the sorrow that it has brought back because of the misrepresentation of someone he holds in such esteem and regard.

'And then my mother, she was an only child so my dad's brothers were the siblings she never had. And watching her trying to take care of my dad and watch him struggle then also maintain her sorrow and grief at the process of having lost my uncle and having watched his legacy be tarnished [is hard].'

In one scene particularly difficult scene Shirley is shown naked and cuffed, cowering alongside another man having been caught in a homosexual encounter in the YMCA in Memphis, Tennessee. Vallelonga saves him from being arrested by bribing the cops.

The only thing I think he was dependent upon was being successful. He was not dependent on alcohol.

For the family of this 'very private man' the intrusion into an aspect of his life that he did not share even with those closest is a source of great distress.

Patricia said: 'How demeaning and insulting can you be in portraying a man with such dignity, a man of such talent, a man with such presence on the stage or at his performances to the point of near perfection?'

Meanwhile Maurice pointed out that black men weren't allowed in the YMCA in that era 'unless it was to be lynched or drowned.'

The family also disputes the fact that Shirley was ever arrested as he is in a later scene following a traffic stop when being driven after dark in a 'sundown town' (where people of color were legally compelled to leave by sunset).

Maurice said: 'None of my other brothers have ever been arrested. I alone hold the dubious distinction of that.'

As for the suggestion that Shirley was an alcoholic who consumed a bottle of Cutty Sark a night, Patricia said: 'If he drank Cutty Sark it was probably because that was what somebody offered him because to purchase a bottle of Cutty Sark would have been beneath his dignity.

'He was a man of great taste and elegance who drank Chivas Regal which was top shelf at the time or Haig and Haig Pinch or Gran Duque D'Alba [cognac].'

And, she added: 'The only thing I think he was dependent upon was being successful. He was not dependent on alcohol.'

Patricia said: 'How demeaning and insulting can you be in portraying a man with such dignity, a man of such talent, a man with such presence on the stage or at his performances to the point of near perfection?'. Pictured l-r: Patricia Shirley, daughter Karole Shirley and Maurice

Karole explained: 'I'm honored that someone would want to tell his story. The difficulty is if you want to tell the story, tell the story - don't tell your story and then bring my uncle in to validated your perspective, to validate going from being incredibly overtly racist to just racist.' Pictured: Shirley in his apartment above New York's Carnegie Hall wearing a Shaman Coat 1997

Karole said: 'Why would a classically trained famous black man, who has three degrees, who has traveled the world and speaks eight different languages, need an Italian American who is admittedly racist and has not been outside his own borough to teach [him] about his own culture?'. Pictured: Album sleeve for Point of View by Dr Donald Shirley

Nor did he require the sort of 'education' given to him by Mortensen's Vallelonga in the movie that shows the driver teaching Donald how to eat fried chicken and chiding him for not knowing or liking 'your people's music,' such as Little Richard and Aretha Franklin.

For Karole and her parents there is another layer to this narrative beyond the simple misstatement of the facts of a man who could fry up the best chicken imaginable and had pictures of himself with Aretha Franklin on his wall.

She explained: 'If you're telling the story of a racial divide during a racially divided time in a racially divided country and all of your information and all of your perspective is from only one of those sides, how do you feel that you can portray that properly?

'To feel the right and the privilege to depict your life and to tell your story without you, without any input from those who knew you…It's a travesty.

'Why would a classically trained famous black man, who has three degrees, who has traveled the world and speaks eight different languages, need an Italian American who is admittedly racist and has not been outside his own borough to teach [him] about his own culture?'

In reality, though he lived in New York, Pensacola-born Shirley grew up in the segregated south. He marched at Selma, was there to his hear personal friend Dr Martin Luther King deliver his 'I have a dream' speech in Washington DC in 1963 and the bulk of his venues in the 1962 tour of Green Book fame were not, as shown in the movie, white country clubs and governor's mansions.

According to his brother, Shirley performed for the most part in what were then called Negro College Fund schools - now known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities. His aim was to improve their economic status.

The family communicated their unhappiness and among other things put in calls to the production company and lead actors' agents.

But while Ali extended an apology, Karole revealed that Viggo Mortensen and director Paul Farrelly doubled-down on their insistence that their depiction of Shirley and of the friendship is accurate.

But while Ali extended an apology, Karole revealed that Viggo Mortensen and director Paul Farrelly doubled-down on their insistence that their depiction of Shirley and of the friendship is accurate

Asked what he would like people to know about his brother Maurice said simply: 'My brother had a good life. I'm proud of that'

She said: 'They have said very biting and very disrespectful things about my family. They said we were angry and resentful about not having a relationship with Donald.

'Peter Farrelly said he had reached out to the family but we weren't having it. You've never reached out to us.

'I mean they can't undo what they've done but I can honestly tell you my parents are incredibly gracious people and we would absolutely sit down with them.'

In life Shirley's story was rewritten to make him 'acceptable' to white audiences.

He was told he could not be a classical pianist because white audiences wouldn't accept a black man in such a role. His name was shortened to Don - which he hated - and he was cast as part of a 'trio.'

His background was made more 'exotic' with the claims that he was from Jamaica, though he was born in Pensacola, and had trained in Europe as a child. He had been offered a scholarship in Russia as child prodigy but his mother would not let him go so far away.

Today, the family says, there is a bitter irony that he should suffer the same injury after death with his life being rewritten once more this time as a foil for a racist white man.

Karole explained: 'I'm honored that someone would want to tell his story. The difficulty is if you want to tell the story, tell the story - don't tell your story and then bring my uncle in to validated your perspective, to validate going from being incredibly overtly racist to just racist.

'It's a huge step for the racist but from our perspective, from our uncle's perspective, that's a really small step.'

Asked what he would like people to know about his brother Maurice said simply: 'My brother had a good life. I'm proud of that.'

For Karole's part, asked about her uncle's legacy she said: 'When my uncle played you could feel his spirit. You could feel the spirit of our ancestors, the promise of this country, all the different parts of world that he had been to.

'You could feel his triumph. You could feel his tragedy. You could feel his misery. You could feel his ministry. You could feel everything through his music. So I would tell people to watch the movie because it's entertaining. It is fiction but it is entertaining.

'But listen to my uncle's music and really learn because that's his biography.'"

The Empire star is free to travel only to New York and California to meet with his legal team, Page Six reports.

Smollett is facing disorderly conduct charges for filing an alleged false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racially charged homophobic attack. As TheGrio previously reported, texts between the singer and the Nigerian-American brothers who are accused of helping him orchestrate the “attack” confirm that the $3500 check at the center of this case was indeed for fitness training and not payment for the alleged hate crime. This calls the claims by the Superintendent of Chicago PD, Eddie Johnson, into question.

—Is it over for Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes? The actor says he’s single at charity Oscars gala—

Johnson appeared exclusively on ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday and stood by his previous statement that the two brothers told police that Smollett gave them a $3,500 check to carry out the elaborate hoax.

“Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” the police chief told “GMA” anchor Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

He added, “It’s important for people to recognize that it’s not the Chicago Police Department saying he did something, it’s the evidence, the facts and the witnesses that are saying this.”

—R. Kelly posts bond after spending a weekend in Chicago jail—

Smollett denies any role in staging the crime and turned himself in to police last Thursday morning.

A judge set bond at $100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. The actor pleaded not guilty and was released after posting 10 percent of his bail. Empire producers then announced that Smollett’s character had been written out of the last two episodes of the season.

His next court appearance is scheduled for March 14."

Smollett is facing disorderly conduct charges for filing a false police report after claiming two masked men attacked him, hurled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a noose around his neck. No one believes his tale — from the investigators to his “Empire” co-stars, and now Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says Smollett “still has the presumption of innocence and he still has his opportunity in court if he chooses to go that route.”

But, as he noted “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts on Monday, “there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet that doesn’t support the version that he gave us. There’s still a lot of video evidence, physical evidence and testimony that doesn’t support what he said happened.”

Johnson told Roberts detectives considered Smollett a victim up until they detained and questions the two Nigerian brothers who are allegedly connection to the case.

“I refused to characterize Jussie Smollett as a suspect unless we had concrete evidence,” Johnson said. “The 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody is when it changed.”

He added, “We worked very closely with their lawyer, and (she) went in there to talk to them, and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them – to just tell the truth about what happened,” Johnson said. “And that’s what they decided to do.”

During a press conference led by Johnson last week, he said Smollett “staged” the attack as a “publicity stunt,” because he was “dissatisfied” over his “Empire” salary.

When asked about Smollett using a noose to make an alleged false hate crime accusation during Black History Month, Johnson told Roberts, “The city of Chicago and the Chicago police department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that. But we didn’t earn this particular incident and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary. I just want people to understand that’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department. It’s my responsibility to ensure the record gets set straight.”

He added, “There are real victims of crimes of that nature, hate crimes, and I just hope people don’t treat them with skepticism.”"

A new Rasmussen poll released on Monday reveals that while a majority of Americans (48%) say the number of hate crimes in the country is growing, “nearly as many (40%) think more and more hate crimes are hoaxes by people for personal or political advantage.”

Twelve percent (12%) poll “undecided.”

The data also shows that a majority of Americans (55%) “believe blacks and other minorities are better off in America than in most of the rest of the world.”

“Just 15% think they’re worse off here, while 21% say the treatment of minorities here is about the same as in the rest of the world,” Rasmussen reports.

Most voters (76%) agree that hate crimes are a serious problem in America today.

The poll results come as Mr. Smollett faces charges of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in which he claimed he was a victim of an attack by two men who beat him and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

While Smollett continues to deny the charges, Chicago Police maintain that Smollett is a suspect in its ongoing investigation, accusing Smollett of paying the two men – two Nigerian brothers, one which Smollett said he was hiring as his personal trainer – to stage the attack. Police say the two brothers have confessed to the scheme. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson in an interview Monday morning said that police have “a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet” to support the charges."

The poor guy was only getting $20,000 per episode - pocket change in episodic TV land - and he’s been a regular character on the popular Fox dramatic series since 2015.

He apparently thought that if he got a big splash of national publicity, Fox would have to pay him more.

So last month the gay black former child actor and proud Trump hater played the racist card, the homophobic card and the “I hate Trump” card - all at once.

As the entire country has since found out, Smollett staged a hate crime on the cold streets of Chicago starring himself as the victim. To make sure his attack was sympathetically covered by the media, he told police he was beaten up by two racist, homophobic supporters of Donald Trump in red MAGA hats who, for extra measure, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

To everyone not working in the liberal media or for the Democrat Party, Smollett’s story stunk to high heaven from the get-go.

It was too politically perfect to be true, full of implausible holes and sounded like it was ripped from the script of a bad TV cop show.

But Don Lemon of CNN, Robin Roberts of ABC and the professional Trump-haters on “Morning Joe” and elsewhere swallowed Smollett’s phony story hook, line and sinker.

To them, there is nothing too evil or disgusting that the bigoted supporters of Donald Trump wouldn’t do.

Therefore, Smollett’s outlandish tale didn’t need to be questioned, checked out by the liberal media or even confirmed by police.

It fit their anti-Trump narrative perfectly, so what he claimed happened was automatically true and automatically to be believed.

Thanks to the work of Chicago police, however, we now know Smollett paid two friends $3,500 to help him stage a hate crime because he allegedly was unhappy with his salary.

At a press conference Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said it right: Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I’m left hanging my head and asking why.”

Why? Because Smollett is a troubled egomaniac and had every reason to believe he could get away with it.

He knew his pal Lemon, Hollywood celebrities and left-wing Democrats like Cory Booker would immediately fall for his tale and use it to “prove” their claim that Donald Trump has created a more racist and more homophobic America.

Chicago Police Supt. Johnson was terrific. He blasted the celebrities, media people and presidential candidates for giving Smollett’s “phony attack” so much favorable national publicity.

But where is the outrage of the black community? Where is the outrage of the LGBTQ community?

They are the ones who should be most offended by Smollett’s incredibly inept scheme to become a celebrity victim, because his stunt has diminished the credibility of real hate crimes in the future.

Smollett smeared Trump’s supporters as racists and bigots. He also smeared the ordinary people of Chicago and the U.S.

In the long run his hate hoax and bald-faced lying afterwards have done a public service he never dreamed it would.

It exposed the fake news media for what they are to the whole country and proved how deep and wide the Trump derangement syndrome is in the media and in Hollywood.

Smollett got the attention he craved, but his hoax backfired on him. His scenes in the final episodes of “Empire” reportedly have been drastically cut back.

He could end up in jail for three years for filing a false police report, but in the long run he’ll be excused or forgiven by Hollywood and the liberal media because he’s such a devout Trump hater.

In fact, it won’t surprise me if his progressive friends in La-La Land give him a special Oscar Sunday night for the acting job he did in his dishonest interview with Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America.”

Actor Jussie Smollett’s Evil Academy Award Worthy Performance.

Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1

(ThyBlackMan.com) I recently watched the original Jussie Smollett ABC interview on Youtube in which he claimed to have been attacked by racist homophobic Trump supporters.

Considering that we now know Jussie staged his attack and has been arrested for filing a false police report https://bit.ly/2XeehvL , I thought, “This guy should be nominated for an Academy Award.” In his ABC interview, Jussie’s sincerity, tears and portrayal as a suffering victimized black homosexual man was insidiously and brilliantly executed. https://bit.ly/2IpRh9L

Even though Jussie has been exposed as a liar, will leftists continue to use Jussie’s irresponsible hate generating lie to smear Trump and his supporters? Folks, we have seen this kind of leftist propaganda movie before titled, “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” starring young black criminal Micheal Brown.

A police officer attempted to arrest Micheal Brown after he robbed a convenience store and assaulted the clerk. At 6 ft 4” and 292 lbs, Brown wrestled the officer for his gun and was shot and killed. A witness claimed the white cop murdered Brown while he tried to surrender with his hands in the air. Evidence confirmed that the witness lied. Brown’s blood was found on the officer’s gun and inside his police car, confirming the officer’s account of what happened. https://nws.mx/2ElL8r2

Even after the truth about the Brown shooting was exposed, the Grammy Awards irresponsibly did a musical production number further promoting the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” lie. In essence, the Grammy Awards show cruelly painted targets on the backs of our brave men and women in blue across America. Grammy Awards show producers purposely filled black youths with hatred for police, victim mindsets and hatred for their country based on a proven lie.

To this day, leftists are still promoting and many blacks still believe the lie that Michael Brown was shot in cold blood by a racist white cop. Thanks to fake news media, Democrats and Hollywood many blacks believe the lie that police routinely murder blacks. Consequently, police are being ambushed and assassinated by blacks seeking revenge. https://nydn.us/2GHd5fs

It blows my mind that there was very little fake news media coverage or outrage over a mob of Black Lives Matter thugs marching down a NY street chanting, “What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!” https://bit.ly/1BMKT1t Meanwhile, stats confirm that police are the greatest defenders of black lives. https://bit.ly/2pj6TOE 0

Jussie was unsuccessful in his attempt to get his bogus staged attack caught on closed circuit TV. Rush Limbaugh pointed out and I agree that had Jussie gotten his fake attack on video, fake news media would promote it 24/7; possibly causing riots and violence across America.

When the dust settles leftists will, more than likely, make Jussie Smollett a hero. Leftists will claim Jussie raised awareness about those routinely abused by racist homophobic Trump supporters.

In my opinion, Jussie’s insidious fake attack scheme is the equivalent of yelling fire in a crowded auditorium. It could have led to massive racial violence resulting in many Americans being injured and lives lost.

I hold no malice against Jussie. I pray that this young man will come to know Jesus, turning his life around. Behavior has consequences. I believe Jussie Smollett should be prosecuted. We have emboldened leftists by allowing far too many of their evil hate and violence generating hoaxes to go unpunished.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told “Good Morning America” on Monday that there is “a lot more evidence” to support the police case against Jussie Smollett for allegedly staging a hate crime attack last month. “There’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave,” Johnson told Robin Roberts. “There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Oops.

As my colleagues, Elizabeth Vaughn and Sister Toldjah wrote here and here he was pleading with people he did not do this. These stories leaked over the weekend were undoubtedly by Jussie’s PR team trying to win some sort of victory in the realm of public opinion.

Superintendent Eddie Johnson was having none of that.

The core of this story is “IF” Smollett lied about a hate crime to bolster himself financially, what should be done to him in the penalty phase and how to treat this rush to judgment stories moving forward. Everyone jumped a bit quick on this one and the Covington kids story, but the smart, rational people pulled back as facts came in. Knowing we all can make mistakes is one thing but learning from those mistakes is quite another.

Will anyone from CNN actually learn from this?

Maybe, but I doubt it.

Roberts made the comment about holes in the “Empire” actor’s story during her interview with Chicago’s superintendent of police Eddie Johnson on Monday morning.

WATCH:

“We worked very closely with their lawyer, and their lawyer went in there to talk to them and whatever she said to them apparently got through to them to just tell the truth about what happened, and that’s what they decided to do,” Johnson stated.

Roberts answered, “Even though that you all were saying early on there was no reason not the believe his story, there were a lot of red flags, that a lot of people saw of people saw. You all had questions. Even though weren’t, of course, going to be public about that.” (RELATED: Here All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgment On The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

“Right, there with questions, but there’s always questions when people are describing incidents to us. We have to maintain the integrity of the investigation and that’s what we did,” the superintendent of police followed up.

Many described her interview with Smollett as “too soft.” She also never used the word “alleged” to describe the hate crime, according to NewsBusters. Both ABC and Roberts defended the interview, saying that, at the time of the interview, police considered him to be “credible.”

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told Chicago police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a noose-like rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Smollett also alleged that the men screamed “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

The poor guy was only getting $20,000 per episode - pocket change in episodic TV land - and he’s been a regular character on the popular Fox dramatic series since 2015.

He apparently thought that if he got a big splash of national publicity, Fox would have to pay him more.

So last month the gay black former child actor and proud Trump hater played the racist card, the homophobic card and the “I hate Trump” card - all at once.

As the entire country has since found out, Smollett staged a hate crime on the cold streets of Chicago starring himself as the victim. To make sure his attack was sympathetically covered by the media, he told police he was beaten up by two racist, homophobic supporters of Donald Trump in red MAGA hats who, for extra measure, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

To everyone not working in the liberal media or for the Democrat Party, Smollett’s story stunk to high heaven from the get-go.

It was too politically perfect to be true, full of implausible holes and sounded like it was ripped from the script of a bad TV cop show.

But Don Lemon of CNN, Robin Roberts of ABC and the professional Trump-haters on “Morning Joe” and elsewhere swallowed Smollett’s phony story hook, line and sinker.

To them, there is nothing too evil or disgusting that the bigoted supporters of Donald Trump wouldn’t do.

Therefore, Smollett’s outlandish tale didn’t need to be questioned, checked out by the liberal media or even confirmed by police.

It fit their anti-Trump narrative perfectly, so what he claimed happened was automatically true and automatically to be believed.

Thanks to the work of Chicago police, however, we now know Smollett paid two friends $3,500 to help him stage a hate crime because he allegedly was unhappy with his salary.

At a press conference Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said it right: Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I’m left hanging my head and asking why.”

Why? Because Smollett is a troubled egomaniac and had every reason to believe he could get away with it.

He knew his pal Lemon, Hollywood celebrities and left-wing Democrats like Cory Booker would immediately fall for his tale and use it to “prove” their claim that Donald Trump has created a more racist and more homophobic America.

Chicago Police Supt. Johnson was terrific. He blasted the celebrities, media people and presidential candidates for giving Smollett’s “phony attack” so much favorable national publicity.

But where is the outrage of the black community? Where is the outrage of the LGBTQ community?

They are the ones who should be most offended by Smollett’s incredibly inept scheme to become a celebrity victim, because his stunt has diminished the credibility of real hate crimes in the future.

Smollett smeared Trump’s supporters as racists and bigots. He also smeared the ordinary people of Chicago and the U.S.

In the long run his hate hoax and bald-faced lying afterwards have done a public service he never dreamed it would.

It exposed the fake news media for what they are to the whole country and proved how deep and wide the Trump derangement syndrome is in the media and in Hollywood.

Smollett got the attention he craved, but his hoax backfired on him. His scenes in the final episodes of “Empire” reportedly have been drastically cut back.

He could end up in jail for three years for filing a false police report, but in the long run he’ll be excused or forgiven by Hollywood and the liberal media because he’s such a devout Trump hater.

In fact, it won’t surprise me if his progressive friends in La-La Land give him a special Oscar Sunday night for the acting job he did in his dishonest interview with Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America.”
