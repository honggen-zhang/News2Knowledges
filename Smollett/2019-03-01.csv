JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — In a story Feb. 26 about a Michigan transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Gay rights activist accused of setting own home on fire

Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist set his own home on fire

JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — Michigan police say a transgender, gay rights activist charged with arson set his home on fire in an incident initially investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime, but the man’s attorney is questioning the evidence.

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn’t provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

“We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,” Elmer Hitt, Jackson’s director of police and fire services, said Monday. “We investigated it over what probably was a year’s time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.”

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline were found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

“The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,” police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor’s case.

“It doesn’t make sense,” Barnett said. “(Joly) was citizen of the year.”

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson’s citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city’s first gay community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Chicago police last week charged the black and gay “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely reporting a racist and homophobic attack.

Smollett claimed he was attacked around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 by two assailants, one wearing a MAGA hat. A police investigation, however, concluded the star of the hit TV series “Empire” hired two men to beat him up in a stunt designed to help him get his $125,000-per-episode pay raised. Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report and his reputation is in tatters, but as bad as that is it’s not the only damage he did.

His playing the role of a hate-crime victim diverted America’s attention from a more important story: the Southern Poverty Law Center’s report that the number of known hate groups in this country grew for the fourth straight year in 2018, reaching a record high of 1,020. That’s a 7 percent increase over the 954 hate groups recorded in 2017 by the SPLC, which has been counting hate groups since 2001.

Smollett tried to portray his attackers as Donald Trump supporters, adding that he recognized at least one as being white. Police said the two men Smollett allegedly hired to hit him were black. His apparent dishonesty aside, the SPLC’s report did note that there has been about a 30 percent increase in the number of hate groups since Trump began his 2016 presidential campaign.

Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC Intelligence Project, said Trump has “given people across America the go-ahead to act on their worst instincts.” Recently released FBI data seem to bolster that point. Statistics show a 30 percent increase in hate crimes from 2015-2017, which followed a three-year period in which hate crimes fell by about 12 percent. The FBI said there were 7,106 hate crimes in 2017, with 57 percent of the victims targeted because of their race and 21 percent targeted because of their religion. That doesn’t prove Trump’s election spurred more attacks, but it’s hard not to see a correlation with the racist rhetoric deployed during his campaign.

That sense of connection was only deepened by a related report by the Anti-Defamation League linking right-wing extremists to the violent deaths of at least 50 people in 2018. That includes the 11 congregants killed by a gunman who opened fire Oct. 27 just before Shabbat services started inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Authorities later linked the alleged gunman, a 46-year-old white man, to anti-Semitic posts to online social media sites.

That’s no surprise. A Center for American Progress report, “Curbing Hate Online,” says social media has become the top recruitment tool for hate groups. The report notes that the “Unite the Right” march in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 “was planned, advertised, coordinated, and even paid for using mainstream online tools such as PayPal, Facebook, and the gamer chat app Discord.” The march ended when a white nationalist plowed his car into counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman, Heather Hyer. The driver has since been convicted of murder.

These events aren’t as remote as many of us in Texas may believe. The SPLC says Hammerskin Nation, a skinhead group that began in Dallas in the 1980s, has used social media to attract members not only in America but in Australia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Russia.

We can’t let Smollett’s apparent wolf-crying discount the real harm hate groups are doing. Steps should be taken to limit the spread of their vile rhetoric before another person is hurt or killed. As the CAP report notes, that’s going to take a more active response by social media and other companies based on the Internet, where so much of the hate activity is organized.

Most of those companies have terms of service and acceptable-use policies. It’s not enough for them merely to post policies denying racist, xenophobic, religious extremist and other hate groups the use of their platforms to spread venom and recruit members. Internet companies must enforce their rules regardless of the impact to their bottom line.

The goal is to have an America that comes closer to resembling the ideal of our nation, a country where people aren’t afraid to be who they are — no matter how they look, worship or love. Let’s focus on making that our story."

Collins, 24, was involved in a car crash on Friday morning about one mile from the team’s facility. Baltimore County police responded to a report of a car that had crashed into a tree on the 10000 block of Dolfield Road at about 6:48 a.m., police spokeswoman Officer Jennifer Peach said to the Baltimore Sun.

Collins was quickly arrested, but the charges against him were not immediately available. Ravens vice president of public relations Chad Steele told Sun that the team had spoken with police and was aware of the situation.

A few hours later, Collins – who was set to become a free agent – was released. The team made it very short and sweet when they tweeted the announcement:

We have waived RB Alex Collins. — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) March 1, 2019

He struggled last year after a breakout 2017 season for the Ravens. Collins finished 2018 with 411 rushing yards, less than half of his 973 in 2017.

His season ended in early December when he was placed on injured reserve with a foot injury. He had started every game until Week 12. but averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and didn’t have a run of longer than 19 yards.

Collins had been on the outs with the team following the season. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said Wednesday that Gus Edwards is the team’s top running back and that the Ravens would add some competition to the position this offseason.

Kenneth Dixon and De’Lance Turner are behind Edwards on the depth chart, and team officials are in Indianapolis this week evaluating potential prospects at the NFL scouting combine."

Yesterday, an attorney for the Osundairo brothers released this statement:

Jussie Smollett Update: Attorney for Osundairo brothers released the following statement on their behalf. #Jussiesmollett @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/EMIOFZTH9Q — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) March 1, 2019

I guess this is intended to generate additional sympathy for the brothers? As far as this story goes, they are definitely more sympathetic that Smollett. He was the ringleader. He (allegedly) concocted the plan. He’s the person who appears to have been motivated by some combination of greed and victimhood chic to carry out this hoax.

And yet, I can’t say I find the brothers all that sympathetic. After all, they did go along with this, apparently because Jussie was their famous buddy. They were members of his entourage who allegedly got him drugs. They should have said no to this but they didn’t want to risk losing the connection that brought some celebrity into their lives. And in the process, they created this hoax and then denied their involvement for 47 hours after they were arrested upon returning from Nigeria. All of it is understandable but it’s not very admirable.

I guess I’d like to hear the apology from their own lips. If they’re really sorry it’ll be apparent. But having their attorney release a statement doesn’t require much of them. Maybe they’re just trying to establish some expression of remorse in case they get charged themselves.

All of this may matter because today NBC 5 in Chicago reports the defense plan being arrived at by Smollett’s attorneys is basically to attack the brother’s credibility as well as that of the police:

Smollett’s defense is expected to argue the check police have said was payment for the hoax attack was actually for training to help Smollett get in shape for a music video shoot, sources familiar with the case said. Images of the check obtained by NBC 5 show a memo line that read “5 week nutrition/workout program (Don’t go).” The check was dated Jan. 23, six days before Smollett claimed he was attacked in Chicago… There are also questions about the information police initially released in the case. Supt. Eddie Johnson said Smollett misled investigators from the beginning by saying at least one of his attackers was white. That key detail was not included in the first police report, a subsequent community alert or Smollett’s own public statements. The detail wasn’t made public for several days following the alleged attack.

That last point is going to be a key one. I don’t see any way to argue Smollett was not involved if he told police his attacker was white. Based on the excerpt above it certainly sounds as if his defense team is gearing up to call the police superintendent (who is black) a liar.

But during his public interview on ABC, Smollett said: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black—I feel like the doubters would have supported me.” Smollett also indicated he could see the area around the attacker’s eyes and the bridge of their nose and that that was the basis of his description to the police. So he seems to have admitted already that he gave a description of his attacker as something other than two black men. How is his defense planning to explain that?"

Zachary Greenberg, 28, was arrested and booked into jail Friday afternoon for the Feb. 19 assault of Hayden Williams, a Leadership Institute field representative who was recruiting students for the right-wing student group Turning Point. The attack was caught on camera.

In a statement, Berkeley said it would formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges:

Today, an Alameda County Superior Court Judge issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect in the matter involving a February 19 assault on Sproul Plaza. Zachary Greenberg was arrested by the University of California Police Department (UCPD) on the warrant and booked into jail at 1 p.m. UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges. Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision.

The university had initially said Tuesday the investigation had been completed and the department was ""seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect."" However, the Alameda County District Attorney's office told the Free Beacon that day ""the matter has not yet been formally submitted for consideration of charging and the investigation is ongoing.""

Dan Mogulof, the assistant vice chancellor in the Office of Communications and Public Affairs, then said, ""We have been in touch with the DA, and our police force is now doing some additional investigative work necessary for a determination of charges and/or the issuance of a warrant for the suspect's arrest.""

Williams was attacked on Feb. 19 while tabling on the campus's main plaza on behalf of the right-wing student group Turning Point. According to him and other witnesses, two men walking by were infuriated by a sign on his table reading ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" a reference to the Jussie Smollett case. He took his phone out and started filming as the men accused him of promoting violence and racism.

A bystander took video from the side as one man in a black shirt, after flipping over Williams's table, began pushing and swearing loudly at Williams, threatening to ""shoot his ass"" and finally punching him in the face, leaving him with a black left eye. Among other vulgarities, the assailant called him a ""f—ing c—t.""

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Williams praised the police and said he wanted due process for the suspect, but he criticized the university administration for enabling an intolerant culture.

""Well, I respect due process and, you know, I’m confident that he will be found. The police are doing good work on this case. And my main critique is with the administration for allowing it to get to this point where this sort of violence is accepted and even encouraged by some,"" Williams said.

The university condemned the assault and said there was no excuse for violence or harassment. It's another incident of far-left violence in a town that's been criticized for being intolerant to conservative views.

Left-wing ""antifa"" members attacked a peaceful, right-wing demonstration in Berkeley in August 2017. Far-left protesters also caused $100,000 in damage in February of that year when they set fires and rioted over the invitation to campus of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

Berkeley College Republicans President Matt Ronnau told the Free Beacon last week he has not always felt safe while engaging in activism on the campus.

""When we're tabling sometimes, yeah, it's definitely kind of threatening. People have come up and I've been spit at, and other people have been assaulted like Hayden, so it all depends on what you're doing,"" he said.

They also apologized for the negative impact it may have had on people across the country, particularly for those who were victims of hate crimes.

The statement read:

The case was further complicated when authorities learned Jussie worked with the brothers in the past as personal trainers and on the set of ‘Empire.’"

Jussie Smollett’s alleged racially-charged attack joins the host of other hate crimes supposedly perpetrated by Make America Great Again Trump supporters that made national news but turned out to be untrue.

Jussie was capitalizing on the leftist narrative which depicts America as oppressive and President Donald Trump, Trump supporters, and conservatives as determined to drag us back in time to segregation and perhaps even slavery. Like Bill Clinton, they claim that the slogan “Make America Great Again” is a racist dog whistle. The drumbeat that America is racist and black people should be in constant fear for their lives distracts from our progress and discourages healing and unity that should be achievable.

The impact of this concerted PR campaign is clear.

According to new Gallup polling, a majority of blacks (59 percent) consider black-white relations bad. This is up from just 28 percent after September 11, 2001. At that time, a whopping 70 percent of blacks described race relations as good — even higher than 62 percent of whites at the time. Overall, just half (51 percent) of all Americans describe black-white relations as good.

From President George W. Bush’s first term into President Barack Obama’s second term, significant majorities of blacks and whites viewed black-white relations positively. 2013 marked a sudden change when perceptions plummeted 20 to nearly 30 percentage points for blacks and whites.

We might trace that to the founding of the activist group Black Lives Matters and the outsized critical voice they’ve had in the public discourse. They went beyond condemning the legitimate issue of police violence and sought to paint America as still overwhelmingly and institutionally racist. As the policing marches waned and perceptions began to improve, the candidate Trump came along and offered a new foil.

Lost amidst the fear-mongering is that, thanks to policy changes made by the Trump administration, blacks as a group are economically better off, are enjoying more opportunity, and can look forward to the promise of greater freedom.

President Trump is right to tout the lowest black unemployment rate in recorded history, currently at 6.8 percent. Getting black Americans to work reduced the persistent unemployment gap between blacks and whites to just 3 percent.

The real world implications of abundant work opportunities are that families have greater resources to chip away at debt, build savings, invest in retirement or their children’s education, and start businesses.

Entrepreneurship among minority business-owners has been robust following the recession. African-American-owned businesses increased by 34 percent and Hispanic-owned business have grown at an even faster pace (46 percent). Business growth among women of color has truly been impressive growing at 163 percent — nearly three times the rate of all women-owned businesses.

In this strong economy and tight jobs market, something remarkably positive is happening. Companies are considering job applicants who would normally be overlooked, particularly former convicts.

The passage of the bipartisan First Step Act championed by President Trump, who worked with lawmakers and groups on both sides of the aisle, will help federal inmates be rehabilitated and gain the training they need to come home job-ready.

President Obama could not move the needle on this issue, but President Trump got it done. This issue alone, which affects communities of color disproportionately, should be enough to signal to these communities that this administration is working for their benefit along with the benefit of all other Americans.

Yet, black celebrities, athletes, and lawmakers, who were vocal about NFL national anthem protests and took issue with President Trump’s position, have been noticeably silent on the successful justice reforms.

We cannot not pretend that there’s no racism in our society. However, we should not ignore the economic progress and sincere efforts underway to provide more and better opportunities for everyone, but particularly for communities of color, today.

Jussie Smollett and those who perpetuate the narrative of America as an irredeemable racist country, aren’t helping anyone. They are encouraging people to ignore the opportunities that surround them, but instead embrace the comfort of victimhood and not take responsibility for their fate.

The idea that this is a path to happiness is the biggest hoax of all.

Jussie Smollett's taking extreme measures to avoid being seen, but everybody's gotta eat ... so we caught a glimpse of him walking into a Chicago restaurant.

We're told Jussie arrived at Eddie V's Prime Seafood Thursday night around 9:30 in a black SUV -- very similar to the one he took from jail last week, along with some of his siblings and security.

The ""Empire"" star kept his head down under the hood of a large winter coat as he hustled in, and stayed about an hour.

Our sources say Jussie's been hounded by media and hasn't been able to stay at his own apartment since the mob scene last week when he was released, so he's been hunkering down at a swanky hotel.

Clearly, he's trying his best to keep a low profile.

(ThyBlackMan.com) From the Duke lacrosse incident to Jussie Smollett and so many other fake incidents in between, they were especially unwise, being African-Americans, to try and fool law enforcement. We saw what happened to Michael Vick and he was not even at home when the dog fights occurred. We saw what happened to O.J. Simpson when he was dumb enough to fall into a trap while trying to get his own possessions back. We see where Bill Cosby had to go. And yet people of color keep playing games with their own freedom, the law, law enforcement and courts anyway.

In this day and time when the courts are locking up Caucasian lawyers, billionaires and former congressmen like flies, it is a very bad time to commit a crime and get caught up in the system “black” man. Then there are those who are most foolish of all such as R. Kelly who kept all the evidence the courts will need in order to crucify him. It’s already foolish to commit a crime then try and fool the police Jussie ‘Not Too Bright” Smollett. But it is even worse to help them put you away.

And that is just scratching the surface. Yet again and again too many African-Americans somehow think they can run game, scams and cons and yet never get caught. Wrong. And in 2019, big brother, big sister and the whole big family is watching you from Face book to Google, your car computer to your GPS, your cell phone to your television.

MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN PRISON DIDN’T THINK THEY WOULD GET CAUGHT

Let’s use Jussie Smollett as an example of what not to do. I knew he was lying from the beginning and it was far too easy for me as one person to tell. They assigned 12 detectives to his alleged attack and somehow he thought he could fool everybody. Innocent until proven guilty? The presumption of innocence only applies in a court of law – and it is doubtful for a man of color if it ever applies at all, anywhere, anytime.

Jussie did almost everything wrong except make a taped confession. He stayed in communication with the two men he hired both before and after the incident. He picked men who had acted as extras on the set of Empire. He paid them with a check. Really Jussie? He gave them a ride. He gave them money to buy a rope, bleach etc and they were caught on store surveillance. He trusted them not to tell. He gave conflicting stories. He brought the incident to the media when he couldn’t even stick to one consistent story or pattern of lies. Jussie is lucky the two men he hired didn’t take the money and do nothing. Or lie about how much he gave them. If they had said he gave them $100 each, what could he have said? And the dumb dumb list goes on and on.

Yes the police are understaffed. But believe this, if they make you their focus, they can catch you anytime they choose to or anytime someone pressures them to. They can call in support from other jurisdictions. They have forensic crime labs. They know how to locate and squeeze witnesses. They know how to follow paper trails or acquire the surveillance footage from where ever they need to – business or residential. And they have the means and resources never even contemplated by the average citizen.

So value your freedom and spread the word to all the scammers, con men and women, gang members, petty thieves, snatch and grabbers, home invaders, car- jackers, drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes and other criminals of every time – including white collar. America has no problem with having the largest incarceration rate of any advanced country in the world even close to our size.

The American judicial system has no problem locking you up if you fall into the trap, meet the profile or commit the crime – guilty or not. Today the plantations of old are now called jails and prisons. And the auction block has changed its name to the court system. Tell our youth this system that needs to be fed like a blood-thirsty maniac carnivore has no problem with digesting them whole – their lives, their dreams and their future. Tell them there are better ways to reach their potential and acquire the things they want. Tell them and keep telling them.

Two brothers who have become a part of the Jussie Smollett story, with the “Empire” actor accused of arranging with the brothers to stage a fake hate crime, have issued a statement through their attorney expressing regret for their roles in the attack.

The statement released today by Gloria Schmidt, a Chicago lawyer for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, was circulated online. It says: “My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

“The Osundairo brothers were originally considered suspects in the early-morning beating Smollett told police he suffered in a downtown Chicago neighborhood on Jan. 29,” USA Today reports. “Smollett told police his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referred to ‘MAGA,’ President Trump’s political slogan, Make America Great Again.

“The brothers were arrested on Feb. 15, detained and interrogated for nearly 48 hours, and finally told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. Police released them without charges.”

Here’s today’s statement …"

While some have called the celebratory month ""a wash"" that and are rejoicing in its end, Cochrane took her own frustrations to Twitter.

Tweeting ""Since #BlackHistoryMonth is already trash, here’s a thread of various levels of horrible, no good, very bad art,"" Cochrane created a thread making fun of a particular strain of black art that puts a mash-up of iconic black figures together in wild, often random situations. Think the Obamas, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcom X, Oprah, Allen Iverson, Kevin Hart, Mike Tyson, and others playing dice on the street, with Hennessey bottles at their feet. Or gun-wielding Bob Marley and Tupac escaping from a pack of people chasing them on horse Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid-style.

“I do feel like this painting style represents kind of what we’re going through particularly this Black History Month. I’ll be honest, I think every Black History Month during the digital age gets increasingly worse,"" Cochrane told VICE. ""To me, there’s just more room for people to kind of destroy a really great celebration through antics and ridiculousness.” She believes the art represents that visually because, in an effort to be all-encompassing, it paints important black figures, ""in ridiculous situations, or situations that don’t make sense, or situations that go against what they actually stood for.”

You want to see Rosa Parks double dutch with Michelle Obama? Just paint it! You wish Bob Marley partied with Muhammad Ali? Make it happen! “I call it standard 125th street fair art,"" Cochrane said. ""Because in New York, or really any major metropolitan area where there are street vendors, you’re going to find this art. If you go to any kind of black expo or Essence festival it’s there. And then it’s going to be hanging in your barber shops, beauty salons, your aunt’s house, etc.” While the art is not exactly new, she explained, “It feels more prevalent now because there are digital artists that take it a little too far and people are trying to get fake-deep with it too.”



In recent years people like Cochrane have started to jokingly analyze the most off-the-wall of this artwork. One of the most well-known examples is a piece featuring Malcolm X baptizing Tupac, which sparked a search for the artist after Twitter users pointed out a muslim (Malcolm X) wouldn't baptize someone, and Tupac's ""Thug Life"" tattoo is misspelled to ""Thug Lafe."" ""The urban legend is that the singer Tyrese painted it,"" Cochrane said. The whole ordeal sparked a hashtag #tyresepainting where people suggest other outrageous painting concepts with historic figures they'd want to see.

The art also shows the challenges of always relying on the same historical figures to represent history and how disorienting it can be during Black History Month to try and consider all of their legacies at once. “It’s always a random gathering of black people,” Cochran explains. “Tupac is always there, he’s like a sub-genre unto himself. But it might be like Tupac, Rosa Parks, Obama, and MLK. Who decided these people need to go together? What are they doing? Where are they going?”

A few artists called her out for seemingly belittling an important black art style, to which she responds that “there’s no public art that isn’t subject to public critique.” But more importantly, the positive side of the art style is certainly not lost on her. “Part of our survival as a people—and this also relates to Black History Month—comes from our ability to take something heavy and turn it into something good or amusing and flip it in a way that actually edifies us instead of scandalizes us,” she said. “The art is really extra for no reason, and we’re really extra for no reason sometimes. That thread, even though it looks like I’m clowning it, I’m really appreciating it.”

A lawyer for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo spoke on their behalf, telling CNN, “My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

The statement comes a few days after Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson appeared on “Good Morning America” to discuss the case. After slamming Smollett last week, he said, “Let me tell, you, Robin, there’s a lot more evidence that hasn’t been presented yet, and does not support the version he gave. There’s still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply does not support his version of what happened.”

Last week, prosecutors released new details about the brothers’ relationship with Smollett before the attack.

During a news conference, prosecutor Risa Lanier detailed Smollett’s alleged plan. Lanier revealed that Smollett was “close friends” with one of the men, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, who was “a source of designer drugs” for the “Empire” actor.

As part of Smollett’s bail, he agreed to have no contact with the brothers. His next court date is March 14.

While some question Smollett’s story, his “Empire” co-star Terrence Howard recently showed his support on Instagram. Along with a video of Jussie, Terrence said, “All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you ♥️.”

Smollett's legal team recently came to his defense after his arrest, saying, ""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.”"

Abimbola “Abel” and Olbinjo “Ola” Osundairo released a statement late Thursday through their attorney Gloria Schmidt as the case now heads to court in a couple weeks.

Jussie Smollett Update: Attorney for Osundairo brothers released the following statement on their behalf. #Jussiesmollett @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/EMIOFZTH9Q — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) March 1, 2019

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the statement continues.

Their statement comes as public opinion towards the Smollett case continues to sway from support of the actor to criticism and rejection. Before the brothers were arrested and released after producing evidence that changed the “trajectory” of the investigation, the alleged attack of Smollett became a focal point for outrage conntected to identity-based violence.

However, as more evidence is released and police continue to strongly state that Smollett is guilty of coordinating a ""fake"" hate crime, national anti-violence groups have come out to highlight the realities of hate crimes in the United States.

“The clients that walk into our offices every day are surviving a culture of violence against LGBTQ people, especially people of color and those of trans experience,"" Eliel Cruz, head of communications of the New York City Anti-Violence project, recently told The Advocate. The organization helps track LGBTQ-based violence, and have reported historic levels of incidents in the recent year.

""It’s unfortunate if anyone, especially someone with this large of a platform, would falsify any parts of a story of hate violence,” Cruz continued. ""Still, the reality is that far too many survivors aren’t believed and don’t get justice for the violence they experience.

And the brothers' latest statement seems to lend support to this work and shows some effort on their part to not let their alleged action deter from an under-reported issue.



(RELATED: A Timeline of the Jussie Smollett Case)

The two brothers became the primary suspects in the Smollett case after surveillance footage was released by Chicago police showing two men leaving the scene of the alleged attack.

Chicago police accused Smollett in a press conference last month of staging the entire incident due to salary issues on his television show, Empire, and misleading their department. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson focused in on the $3,500 check as primary evidence to Smollett filing a false report and staging his own hate crime.

Johnson took to Good Morning America and defended the department’s case just days after the press conference, telling Robin Roberts that the brothers told police during interrogations that this specific check was given to them for the attack.

""I was very acutely aware of the situation in terms of the Chicago Police Department declaring he was a suspect. But I can tell you this, Robin, there's a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet that does not support the version that he gave us,"" Johnson told Roberts. ""There's still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply doesn't support his version of what happened.""

The official didn’t expand on what that evidence is, and when the department was asked in follow-up questions by The Advocate if the brothers have told police that the personal training was being used as a cover-up for plotting the incident, the department refused to elaborate.

“Any comments at this point must come from prosecutors, however we stand firmly behind this investigation that is predicated exclusively on sworn testimony and video recorded interviews that are supported by physical evidence, including text messages and official records,” spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told The Advocate. “Like any and all defendants, Mr. Smollett has the presumption of innocence and this matter will be decided by a criminal court.”

Smollett’s camp was not able to provide comment on whether the actor intentionally misrepresented the check in order to hide payments related to staging the incident. But after last week’s press conference, lawyers representing the actor maintained their defense by lashing out at the Chicago police who they say have created a “spectacle.”

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said after the press conference. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” they continued.

As the actor awaits his next court date on March 14, all of Smollett's projects planned prior to the incident — including the release of a new album — have been paused, along with the actor being written out of Empire’s final episodes."

The mayor of Lamar, South Carolina – Darnell Byrd-McPherson – made news early last month, claiming to be a hate crime victim after a yellowish substance was found on a pair of vehicles belonging to her and her husband.

“We are grateful the person or persons did not try to take our lives but the culprits will be identified and prosecuted,” Byrd-McPherson told Tonya Brown of WPDE TV 15 (ABC – Florence/ Myrtle Beach) at the time. “Love conquers hate and my husband and I refuse to be intimidated by those who perpetrated this act of vandalism which I classify as an act of hatred.”

Tough talk …

According to McPherson, she originally thought the yellowish substance “was pollen,” but she, her husband and her neighbor took a closer look and “noticed the cars looked like someone had spray painted on both our vehicles.”

Well guess what … it was pollen.

State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) announced it was unable to conduct lab tests in connection with this alleged “hate crime” because the Lamar police department failed to provide samples from the vehicles. However, an incident report from the police department described the “yellowish” substance as having the consistency of “a type of powder similar to pollen.”

“It was pollen,” a source close to the investigation confirmed to this news outlet.

In other words, Byrd-McPherson (above) was right the first time … and probably should have thought twice before launching into her “love conquers hate” spiel.

Maybe love does conquer hate … but can it conquer allergy season?

We shall see … but Byrd-McPherson and her husband should probably prepare themselves for a lot more yellowish-tinted “hate” appearing on their vehicles in the weeks to come.

Frankly, we love it when nonsense like this is exposed for what it is … which is nonsense. We also appreciate the opportunity afford by this latest fake hate crime to espouse our views once again on this subject.

Our long-held belief – reiterated often over the years – is that “crime is crime,” and that “some level of hate (is) necessary for the commission of any crime.”

Drake’s father is weighing in on hot button news items and we kind of wish he wouldn't.

In an interview with Variety, Dennis Graham defended Jussie Smollett and R. Kelly, both of whom are facing egregious allegations.

Smollett, who stars (for now at least) on the show Empire, has been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly making a false police report—a felony offense that could be punishable by up to three years in jail. Smollett, who is gay and black, alleged he was attacked by two white men in Chicago on January 29, who yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him, made references to MAGA, put a noose around his neck and poured a chemical on him. Chicago police later alleged Smollett orchestrated the attack for attention. However, details about the case are still unfolding.

Speaking to Variety about his new single “That on That,” Graham revealed that he thinks Smollett is misunderstood.

“That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story,” he said, seemingly not elaborating further on that theory.

He also stuck up for singer R. Kelly, who has been charged with ten counts of aggravated sexual abuse, involving alleged victims as young as 13 years old. Kelly’s alleged predatory behavior was the subject of a recent six-part docu-series called Surviving R. Kelly, though the allegations against him have swirled for decades.

Graham told Variety Kelly is a “good friend” of his.

“I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent,” he said.

He probably should have just stuck to talking about the single.

Marching To Gilead

I suppose Mr. Trump dangled visions of North Korea’s future as a Buick showroom and the mysterious Kim Jong Un detected some kind of trap there. A correspondent with military intel credentials writes:

“[Eric] Hoffer’s observation that people only revolt when things are getting better seems applicable to DPRK. I can only assume that Kim and his cabal in NK know this or somehow instinctively understand it. In short, as I see it, he can’t afford to let things get really better for North Korean people. So, I believe Trump’s carrot of great economic success for DPRK’s people probably scares Kim badly.”

It was certainly hard to imagine the two leaders in conversation: The President with his larval vocabulary and Mr. Kim in his life-long solipsistic haze. Perhaps they compared hair-dos, both equally strange, would you not admit? Something tells me that Mr. Kim is not a golfer, so that was out as an icebreaker, though it’s said he does enjoy firing artillery at human targets — one thing that Mr. Trump has not been accused of by former consiglieri-turned-pagliaccio Michael Cohen. Perhaps Mr. Trump let Mr. Kim in on the glorious beauty of an American Cheeseburger, a sure-nuff wonder of the world!

In any case, the US president trundled home without nailing that ole coonskin to the wall, as one of his predecessors put it, but the game isn’t over. For now, it’s back to war on the home front against the armies of Wokesterdom. That movement appears to be floundering a bit too now as Jussie Smollett whirls down the memory hole, and #MeToo sputters, and the various congressional committees scrape the bottom of every barrel for the always-elusive triumphal “gotcha” in their crusade to correct the 2016 election.

The fishy barrel that Michael Cohen came out of provided disappointingly thin sludge, so now The New York Times (official playbill of Wokesterdom) informs us that next up they’ll be hauling Mr. Trump’s financial officer, one Allen Weisselberg, into the star chamber for a ‘splainin’ session. Pretty soon, they’ll make the amazing discovery that the New York City construction scene is run by the mob. Won’t that be a revelation?

Let’s face it, March is a month that drips with fraughtness. Everybody is good and goddam sick of winter, yet it lingers sadistically, not unlike the Mueller investigation. Then, you get to the middle of the month and what’s there? The sinister Ides, an age-old ceremonial turning point of the year recognized by the ancients even before Julius Caesar got whacked in the Roman senate. I propose that mid-March this year will be the occasion of so many shoes dropping that Washington will look like a road show of Shuffle Along.

Everybody and his/her/zhe/they’s uncle expects Mr. Mueller to cast down his report from on high. In a non-Bizarro world it would be a catalog of indictments for most of the FBI executive leadership circa 2016-2018, and a few cherries-on-top from the DOJ, CIA, and the DNC. More likely, it will be a stuffed, roasted rump of innuendo drenched in Russian dressing garnished with rinky-dink “process” crime convictions. One way or another, it’s sure to disappoint the minions of Wokesterdom.

But once that’s out of the way, more interesting action may be in the offing. Mr. Trump, despite all the Twitter bluster, has at least patiently held back on declassifying reams of documents pertaining to official misconduct by many of the investigators themselves, perhaps even Mr. Mueller and some of his colleagues. I expect a steady and measured release of that classified material, and it will tell a tale that may even startle the Wokesters out of their dark raptures.

Nobody knows exactly what the new attorney general, Mr. Barr, might do. So far, he has not done anything. I will be surprised if that continues. He is probably also waiting for the Mueller report before he starts dispatching folks to grand juries, perhaps even a former president, and certainly some of his foot-servants and handmaidens. Upcoming too are actions by the DOJ inspector general, Mr. Horowitz, federal prosecutor John Huber’s forgotten commission, and the reappearance of General Flynn in Judge Sullivan’s DC courtroom.

March is also looking like the moment when the financial world starts rockin’ and rollin’ on the recognition that the global economy has stalled. The fantasy of economic triumph is the one float that the Golden Golem of Greatness has been able to parade around on. Both the real estate markets and the car business have gone south now, and the financial entanglements entailed by them, in the form of securitized mortgages and loans, are janky enough to start blowing up pension funds, insurance companies, and state treasuries just for starters. The complacency on Wall Street ought to be a prime signal for the sentient to duck-and-cover."

The “Real Time” shunned “hipster d**ches” who wear Canada Goose parkas in a new PSA for PETA on “Real Time”. The segment was filmed before taping of Maher’s HBO show on Friday.

“New rule: No more d**ches. I mean the hipster d**ches who piss away $1,000 on a Canada Goose parka and the hipsterazzi who max out their credit cards to look like them,” he said.

“See, what they don’t realize — or may not care about — is that Canada Goose trims its coats with the fur of coyotes who’ve been crushed and mangled in steel traps so painful and indiscriminate that they’ve been outlawed in over 85 countries,” the television personality continued.

Maher explained how the coyotes “try to chew off their own leg” in an effort to return to their pups. Those who don’t are “strangled or beaten to death by the a**holes who set the traps… If they do, they die later anyway of blood loss, infection, shock or gangrene.”

The treatment of geese is equally horrific. According to Maher, geese are “grabbed by the neck, stepped on, and crammed into crates so crowded they make clown cars look like Cadillacs.”

“Don’t wear Canada Goose. Only a d**che does that,” Maher concluded. “You won’t look cool — you’ll look cold.”

Canada Goose defended their company against Maher’s remarks in a statement to ET Canada. “We are disappointed that PETA continues to grossly misinform their spokespeople about our use and sourcing of fur and down and we would encourage them to do their research first and not misrepresent the facts,” they said.

“This scripted rhetoric continues to attempt to mislead consumers,” Canada Goose continued. “While we remain committed to the responsible use and ethical sourcing of all materials in our products, as evidenced by our transparency standards.”"

Jussie Smollett tried to keep a low profile and avoid being seen as he made a rare appearance in public on Thursday night in Chicago.

Smollett was seen entering Eddie V's Prime Seafood with his brother Jake, an unidentified woman and his security. The restaurant is located about a half a mile from his apartment but we're told Smollett is staying at a nearby hotel to avoid any media frenzy.

As the ""Empire"" star entered the restaurant, his bodyguard (the same guy who led him out of jail last month) can be seen in the background. When Smollett left, he entered the same SUV he rode in when he was released from jail on February 21.

Jussie Smollett’s family has been very supportive of the star since the incident happened, and lashed out at the media in particular. “Birds of Prey” star Jurnee Smollett even quoted Malcolm X in accusing the media of making the “victim look like the criminal.”

Following his arrest, ""Empire"" producers announced Smollett would take a break from the show, saying, ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson went on ""Good Morning America"" this week and said ""there’s a lot more evidence"" against Smollett that has yet to be revealed.

Smollett was arrested on February 21 on charges of filing a false police report."

By recklessly keeping the nation in a perpetual state of agitation on matters of race, immigration and gender, the SPLC all but guarantees that we will get more fake hate crimes in the future. This will only serve to polarize the nation even further, and it needs to end immediately.

To be sure, there are fringe groups in our country that truly espouse hatred, and they deserve to be marginalized. Fighting groups such as the Ku Klux Klan several decades ago gave the SPLC stature and credibility. Sadly, the SPLC has squandered that heritage by now acting as a left-wing thought police bully, hurling the “hate group” slur at people and organizations who simply have different political views.

“Hate groups are on the rise!” That was the message from breathless reporting on the new “hate map” by media enthusiastic to advance the SPLC’s narrative. Why are hate groups allegedly on the rise? One reason might be that the SPLC has watered down the definition of a “hate group” to the point where anyone advancing a traditional or pro-American position is deemed guilty.

Numerous Christian churches have been added to the SPLC’s list along with racial supremacist groups, under the guise that these religious groups are “anti-LGBT.” Have these churches ever committed acts of violence against LGBT Americans? No, most simply believe, because of their religious faith, that marriage should be between a man and a woman.

Targeted groups quickly find that character assassination is just the beginning. The SPLC’s ultimate goal is to destroy the groups on its “hate map” by bankrupting them through online de-platforming and encouraging banks, insurance companies and other vendors to treat them as pariahs. This is modern-day racketeering on a scale that would make Al Capone proud.

My own organization, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), has been targeted by the SPLC. Our crime? Defending the interests of American citizens and legal immigrants of all backgrounds while politicians, corporations and well-funded advocacy groups exploit our laws to benefit foreign nationals. The SPLC has come down firmly on the side of illegal aliens, many of whom drive down wages for Americans, act as a drain on our social services and commit felonies that injure or kill innocent Americans.

Another reason why hate crimes might be on the rise is because being a self-appointed “hate crime watchdog” is a highly profitable enterprise. The “poverty” part of SPLC’s name reeks of Orwellian irony, as the group has raised nearly a half-billion dollars in donations from the likes of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and actor George Clooney. This is in addition to the cozy relationship the SPLC enjoys as the “trusted flagger” for Big Tech giants, serving as judge, jury and executioner for content on platforms like Google and Facebook. An IRLI investigation revealed that the Department of Defense was using SPLC manuals for its employee training on hate groups and hate crimes until the practice was discontinued in 2017.

For all those who hyperventilate at the unveiling of the latest SPLC “hate map,” there is an alarming and ever-growing list of fake hate crimes since Donald Trump has been president. Many of these incidents get lavish media coverage when they occur. Significantly less coverage is given when they are later revealed to be the work of politically motivated scam artists.

So why did Jussie Smollett think he could get away with what appears to be a shameless hate crime hoax? Maybe because thanks in part to the SPLC seeing “hate” under every rock, there is a huge upside to being seen as the victim in 2019 America. When the alleged attackers check the right boxes—in this case white, male Trump supporters—there is no shortage of media talking heads willing to believe it. Only because Smollett’s apparent hoax was so implausible did it cause even those wishing it to be true to balk.

Much like it appears with Smollett, the SPLC has been crying “wolf” to excess with its nonstop accusations of hate. The fact is that most Americans just want to live their lives in peace alongside their neighbors, regardless of their color, faith or orientation. It is only when seen through the politically agenda-driven lens of the SPLC and the mainstream media that America looks like a hopeless cauldron of hate and division. Instead of being treated as a watchdog for extremism, the SPLC should be shunned as the irresponsible, hyper-partisan and financially-motivated extremist group it is.

After weeks of wall-to-wall fawning coverage of unsubstantiated allegations, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was forced to turn himself into authorities for orchestrating one of the most elaborate hate crime hoaxes in American history. In the very same week, on Tuesday, in a twist of intersectional irony, an actual hate crime was committed against a conservative at the University of California, Berkeley who was holding a sign that read, “Hate Crimes Hurt Real Victims.”

The UC Berkeley attack hits extremely close to home. The victim’s name is Hayden Williams, and he was on campus that day helping recruit new student members for an organization I founded called Turning Point USA. In a very real sense, it was Turing Point USA’s mission — to promote conservative values and ideological diversity at universities like UC Berkeley — that put him in harm’s way.

After watching the footage and verifying its authenticity, our team immediately reached out to Hayden to ensure he was safe. I also knew that if we could enlist the media’s help, the chances of arresting and ultimately bringing the attacker to justice would be greatly improved. After all, we had a crystal clear photo of the attacker snapped by Hayden mid-assault. Moreover, the assailant demonstrated clear ideological animus against conservatives, making this not only a case of criminal battery, but of ideological hate.

We also had the gruesome video itself, which quickly went viral across social media. And as if all of that weren’t enough, the attack just so happened to take place at UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza, the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, as Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax dominated the national discussion.

This was the kind of story journalists would salivate over, right? Apparently not.

While I appreciate the few national outlets that chose to cover the story, those that did led with headlines like CNN’s “Conservative activist allegedly attacked on UC Berkeley campus.” [Emphasis added]

Newsweek’s headline was nearly identical: “Conservative student allegedly assaulted at UC Berkeley while recruiting other conservatives.” This despite multiple eye witness accounts, video evidence from various angles, a police report, and even a statement from school administrators condemning the attack. I understand not rushing to judgment, but these headlines insinuate Hayden had done something wrong.

On the contrary, this was precisely the sort of open and shut case that Jussie Smollett had hoped to fabricate. While Smollett’s tale turned out to be too good to be true, at least for those with a deeply cynical view of America, Hayden’s story, of course, was not. It was verifiable and credible in every way. You’ll understand, then, why I publicly asked: What would have happened if it had been a MAGA-hat-wearing conservative who attacked a progressive?

Of course, the media would have loudly condemned the violence, and rightly so. But they would have also told us with impassioned pleas that it was a byproduct of the toxic and hateful presidency of Donald Trump. They would have devoted hours to discussing how we can pull the country back from the brink. There would have also been focused media pressure on local law enforcement demanding answers. This is exactly what the news media should be doing. Instead, there was only a smattering of media outlets, mostly conservative, requesting information and coming up empty.

The Daily Californian, a student publication that covers the Berkeley area, was the first to report that a suspect had been identified. The report provided no further details about a pending arrest and what, if any, charges would be filed. Despite our best efforts, days passed with zero additional details. Finally, on Tuesday of this week, campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof issued an update indicating that University of California Police (UCPD) had concluded its investigation and that “based on the results … the department is seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect.” Mogulof added that UCPD will “immediately pursue the suspect’s arrest pending a recommendation from the Alameda County’s District Attorney.”

As of Thursday, we’ve been told that the DA has asked for additional investigation “for a determination of charges and/or the issuance of a warrant for the suspect’s arrest.”

While we continue to monitor the case, even as our hope for a resolution is delayed, the reality is that violence and threats of violence against conservatives on college campuses is only becoming more common.

Perhaps if the media pursued stories like the UC Berkeley battery with the same volume and vigor as those “alleged” crimes that more neatly fit their narrative, colleges would be much safer places for people like Hayden.

Every American who values the First Amendment and the marketplace of ideas should contact UCPD and demand the suspect be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Unfortunately if we’ve learned anything from the past week, it’s that the mainstream media will not be calling.

Almost. We mean it was an alleged pre-planned self-inflicted wound.

Now one of the most vocal people in Hip-Hop, Vince Staples, has thrown in his two cents and while many people have responded to Smollett allegedly staging his attack with horror and anger, VS isn’t too upset about it. In fact, he hopes people get over it and let Smollett go about his life.

In an interview with GQ, the Big Fish Theory rapper didn’t just absolve the Empire actor of his questionable actions, but also says he shouldn’t face any punishment for falsifying a police report.

“Ah, man, free the Juice Man. He’s just running a little scam. Shit, the fact he feels like he has to do that says more about this world and less about him. Because nobody wants to do that. Hopefully he don’t get time because police are smoking people, falsifying police reports, and they get to go home so let my boy go home.”

Had someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this, FOX “News” anchors would be demanding she apologize to police and calling for her deportation regardless of her being an American citizen. But no one up there knows anything about Hip-Hop so Vince Staples will be spared the wrath of the far-right media.

What do y’all think of Vince Staples assessment of the situation? Was Jussie Smollett’s actions more an example of how the world has been turned it’s head since the 2016 elections as opposed to an attempt for the rumored pay raise? Should he be forgiven for staging his attack if that turns out to be true? Let us know in the comments below."

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the Osundairo brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told CNN on Thursday.

Originally, the brothers kept quiet after it came out that Smollett allegedly faked the attack. However, they broke their silence shortly after Smollett was arrested. “We are not racist,” they told CBS2. “We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and we are American citizens.”

Smollett reported being assaulted by two men wearing “Make America Great Again” hats to police on Jan. 29. Smollett turned himself in Feb. 21, after it came out that he allegedly faked the attack. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett Removed From Last Two Episodes Of ‘Empire’)

The Chicago police said the Osundairo brothers confessed about the whole plot during the last hour the police could hold them in custody.

The full interview is available on the podcast here.

Katrina Trinko: We’re here at CPAC and with me is Hayden Williams. You might have heard about him in the news coverage this week. He was at University of California, Berkeley last week trying to get conservative students interested in a conservative student organization, Turning Point USA, I believe, and, Hayden, something pretty dramatic happened.

Hayden Williams: Yeah, some students there asked me to come and help them set up for a protest against this recent hate crime hoax with Jussie Smollett. And that’s basically my job with leadership, to help conservatives recruit new members and hold events and that sort of thing.

We all met on Sproul Plaza on Tuesday around 10 a.m. and we set up our table and brainstormed some signs that we could make and one of them we came up with was “Hate Crimes Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims.” Another one was “This is MAGA Country” because we wanted people to know that this isn’t what we stand for, these sorts of lies that divide people on immutable things.

They’re really divisive and that’s not what we’re about because “This is MAGA Country” is one of the lies Jussie told about his story to try to smear Trump supporters. A lot of these conservatives are Trump supporters, so they wanted to protest this and before I knew it, we’re getting attacked.

Trinko: … And I believe it actually became physical, is that right?

Williams: That’s right.

So, we were there for a few hours and I was there with the president and the vice president of the club and when this happened these two guys just approached our table and started cussing at us and asking us, “What are we doing here?” And I could tell they weren’t really there to have a conversation.

I was kind of worried about the safety of the students I was with and my own, so I pulled out my camera like second nature. The leadership issue has training that teaches you how to handle these sorts of situations and so that’s one thing they teach us, just try to document everything.

Trinko: Right.

Williams: Don’t retaliate, don’t egg them on, just try to record.

Trinko: And I think that’s great advice for anyone in a tense situation. Recordings don’t lie.

Williams: Yeah, it’s completely objective and it’s crucial evidence. So I did just that, and whenever I do that, I hope it would diffuse the situation and most of the time it does. Nobody wants to be caught on camera doing something crazy. But these guys did not care.

As soon as I pulled out my phone, one of them said, “You guys are promoting violence,” and then out of nowhere my phone gets smacked out of my hand. I go to pick it up off the ground and then the table gets flipped over and I turn around and this guy is just looking at me with flames in his eyes and he starts telling me, “Get out of my face, get that camera out of my face,” and he starts pushing me and punching at me. It was just a really scary situation.

I’ve got most of it on film but he swatted my phone down about three times in total and the third time he got it I think the video stopped for whatever reason and he took my phone from me.

Luckily there was a third-person angle, some student who was walking by and realized what happened, basically, just took it upon himself to record.

So we have this angle, and if you actually look closely at the video, you can see my phone in this guy’s right hand when he punches me and knocks my hat off my head and then it looks like I’m tussling for his sweater or something, but really I’m just trying to retrieve my phone from him. Fortunately, he drops it and it lands between my legs and I go to pick it up and he kind of walks away, but he’s still yelling.

I look down at my phone and I realize that he was coming back and I didn’t know if it was still recording or not, my phone. He just gets in my face and starts yelling and I’m like, “Oh, wow, this is a really tense situation.” And I look down at my phone again after he’s done yelling and right then is when he just throws the hardest punch I’ve ever taken in my life.

The really disturbing part though was the people around us that were egging him on. … Some guy was saying, “I’m on your side, you’re winning this fight.” It was just really demented. I don’t care who you are, what you believe, if I see you in a distressed situation like that and you’re being attacked, I’m going to do everything I can to help you out out. I wouldn’t even think about mocking you.

Trinko: Right, no, one would hope that no matter what your political ideology, you wouldn’t support physically hurting someone over it. What has the response been like? Has anyone been charged, or what’s happening?

Williams: It’s still under investigation. We’re not sure who exactly this individual is, but I do have pretty good evidence of his face so it’s my hope that the police will investigate it to the fullest extent they can and arrest this person that did this soon.

My beef is really with some of the people in the campus community, like faculty members and students that were promoting this even on social media—kind of calling this guy a hero after it went viral, saying this is a good thing, basically, we need more of this. And that’s just really disappointing and it goes to show the kind of culture that has been existing at Berkeley and thriving, quite frankly, not just at Berkeley or not just in California, but at campuses across the country. It’s kind of a problem in academia.

That’s on thing I’d like to see is kind of a self-reflection as far as the culture of hostility toward conservatives.

Trinko: And what has the media response been like? I saw The Washington Post had an epic headline that was something like “Conservative punched at UC Berkeley,” “Conservatives upset,” you know, one of those pounce headlines.

Williams: Yeah, I think the same outlet that said Jussie Smollett was assaulted said that I was allegedly assaulted—I believe that was CNN. The liberal media will not want to talk about this because it’s so one-sided, there’s no way to twist the truth to fit their narrative, so they just have to ignore it and hope it goes away and the story dies. But I don’t think we’re going to let this die because this really exposes the double standard and the hypocrisy of the left.

It’s a tragic story, too. You know, I didn’t want to be a victim. I don’t want to be known for this. It just happened. So it’s my hope that other people can realize that they can stand up for what they believe in, too, and once we hold this person accountable, that that’s the proper thing. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

Trinko: Thank you so much for joining us, Hayden.

Williams: Thanks for having me out.

Trinko: And I hope you get better soon.

Williams: I do too, thank you.

CHICAGO (AP) — Two brothers who told police that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett paid them $3,500 to help stage an attack on himself in Chicago say they regret their involvement in the incident.

Gloria Schmidt is the attorney for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. She issued a statement Thursday evening saying the men have “tremendous regret.”

“They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Schmidt.

Chicago police say Smollett hired the brothers, telling them to physically attack him, shout racist and homophobic slurs, douse him with a chemical and drape a noose around his neck.

Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly making a false police report. His attorneys say he’s innocent.

Schmidt says the men “understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”"

The Juno and Tallulah actress and producer of the docuseries Gaycation writes that she had “no reason” to doubt Smollett’s truthfulness when he first claimed that he was attacked by two men who beat him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, and told him “This is MAGA country!”

But Page notes that the decision to charge Smollett with disorderly conduct for allegedly paying two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack “has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath.”

Page notes, as have other commenters, that if Smollett did indeed stage the alleged hate crime against himself, it could make victims of real hate crimes more reluctant to report the crimes for fear of not being believed. Social conservatives, in particular, have long been skeptical of the idea that a “hate crime” is different or deserves special recognition beyond any other violent crime, with political pundit Ann Coulter going so far as to say “all” hate crimes “are hoaxes.”

But Page says that she has met real victims of hate violence in her travels, particularly during her work on Gaycation, which chronicles LGBTQ stories in countries where homosexuality is criminalized or not widely accepted by society.

“While the media and public debate [Smollett’s] case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” Page wrote.

“I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists,” she added. “The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.”

Page cites FBI data from 2018 showing that hate crimes in America rose 17% during 2017, the third year in a row that the number of incidents has ticked upward.

She also points to recent study from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported that 2018 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ community as evidence that hate crimes are a real problem that need to be addressed.

“As a queer but white cisgender woman, I benefit from the protections and safety that my income and status afford me. But I do not and have not escaped the threats of violence and the very real acts of violence and harassment that threaten and endanger our community and other underrepresented people,” Page writes.

“I endured bullying and sexual violence as a child and teenager on the street and in my professional life. My heart breaks for the people I’ve met who cannot protect themselves and who are objects of scorn, hatred, discrimination and violence because of the social and political context in which they live.”

Page says the increase in anti-LGBTQ violence is, in part, fueled by hateful rhetoric — from politicians, religious leaders, or even family and friends — that trivializes LGBTQ people and promotes disrespect for LGBTQ people’s lives.

“Queerphobia/transphobia is violence perpetrated on our children, our families, our friends and neighbors and the forgotten among us who have no voice. We all have to work together to end the normalization of anti LGBTQ+ sentiment and rhetoric,” she concludes. “No child, no teenager, no adult — no one deserves to be victimized because of who they are. No one should feel shame for who they were born to be or to live their life in fear.

“I am going to use my voice and visibility to continue speaking and — as storytellers and members of an industry with a global platform — I implore you to join me.”"

From racist yearbook photos in Virginia to criminal charges for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett and singer R. Kelly, it was enough to make cultural commentator Keith Boykin tweet that he needed a do-over, and many agreed.

“From what people are doing to us to what we are doing to ourselves, it hasn’t been a good Black History Month,” said Michelle Thomas, president of the NAACP in Loudoun County, Virginia. Her perspective is understandable – three white teachers in an elementary school in her county decided to have students, including at least two black children, play a runaway slave role-playing game to learn about the Underground Railroad. Livid black parents are demanding changes from the school board, which has pledged to address inequities, bias and teacher training.

Lows

Who could focus on the achievements of African Americans when distracted by:

Virginia’s politicians. The month began with the revelation that Gov. Ralph Northam may or may not have been in a 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical College yearbook photo featuring a man in blackface and a man in Ku Klux Klan robes, although he and the state’s attorney general, Mark Herrin, both admit to blackening their faces to portray their favorite entertainers. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax was accused by two women of sexual assault and, to close out the month, the governor’s wife, Pam Northam, is under fire for handing cotton to black students during a tour of the executive mansion, so they could imagine being enslaved.

Celebrity drama. Following the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” a damning new sex video alleged to feature a 14 year old, and a host of women coming forward as #MeToo and #MuteRKelly raised awareness, Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. If it’s true that he staged his own racist, homophobic beating in Chicago, it’s counterproductive to the goals of black people, Thomas said.

“We have so many real incidents of racism and bias, we don’t have to make any up.”

Gloria Browne-Marshall, professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, says the danger with both incidents is collective guilt by association.

“We’ve been given the added burden that when something happens with one (black) person, it is inured to the whole race,” she said, while white misdeeds, such as the Northams’, are considered individual sins.

Random acts of racism. In an editorial, Goodloe Sutton, editor and publisher of the Democrat-Reporter in Linden, Alabama, called for the return of Ku Klux Klan rides and lynchings to clean out Washington, seemingly oblivious to the effect his statement had on black people.

And those were just a few of the incidents that troubled African Americans.

Highs

Walter Huff, 58, a suburban Denver real estate broker, said black people have to take the bad with the good. “It’s a sign of the times and days we are living in. I don’t want the community to lose focus,” he said while preparing a seminar encouraging black homeownership, his positive contribution to Black History Month.

More:The settlement between Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid and the NFL, explained

So what was the good we should have been focusing on? What are some of the things we missed?

Colin Kaepernick's settlement. Lost in the noise of black male celebrities being arrested was Kaepernick’s settlement of the grievance he filed against the NFL in 2017. Kaepernick was the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem as a means of protesting police brutality and racial inequality. He and a San Francisco 49ers teammate, Eric Reid, had alleged that NFL owners had colluded to keep them out of the league because of their protests. Terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Browne-Marshall marks it as a victory both for Kaepernick and others who joined him in protest. Many artists reportedly passed on a chance to perform in this year's Super Bowl in support of Kaepernick. Last month, eight basketball players at the University of Mississippi in Oxford took a knee during the anthem to protest pro-Confederate marches there.

Browne Marshall laments that black people took their eyes off Kaepernick to focus on the entertainers.

“This is huge because this is a movement,” she said, noting that the Ole Miss players weren’t the first and won’t be the last to look to Kaepernick as a role model. She notes that Kaepernick sacrificed some of his best playing years “for us.”

“I don’t think we understand our own power, that we can start a movement and it can change things,” she said.

Seven Oscar wins better than ""Green Book."" Though some derided best picture Oscar winner “Green Book” as a white-savior version of black history, at least we learned who pianist Don Shirley was – a child prodigy who debuted with the Boston Pops in 1945 and held three doctorates, yet played mostly nightclubs as he was not allowed to play at finer venues catering to whites. Mahershala Ali won a best supporting actor award for his portrayal of Shirley.

Regina King won best supporting actress for her role in “If Beale Street Could Talk.”

Among ""Black Panther"" awards, Ruth Carter took home an Oscar for costume design and Hannah Beachler won for production design – each was the first African American to win in her category. Peter Ramsey, who co-directed Sony's “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” took home a best animated feature Oscar. And Spike Lee got his first-ever competitive Oscar for adapted screenplay as a co-writer of ""BlacKkKlansman,"" a win shared with Kevin Wilmott and others.

Lee used the Oscar podium as a pulpit, exhorting the audience to remember the arrival of 20 Africans in 1619 and to vote in the 2020 election because it was the moral thing to do.

Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the new Poor People’s Campaign and the architect of the Moral Monday social justice campaign, was struck by Lee’s call to action.

“He was channeling James Baldwin, Paul Robeson, and (civil rights activist) Ella Baker,” Barber said. “He gave a great performance, but it wasn’t an act. He was calling on us to act and that in itself was powerful.”

More black political power, especially for black women.

There are now more blacks in Congress (51) than at any other time since Reconstruction, Barber said, and the Congressional Research Service counts 46 representatives, 2 delegates, and 3 senators who are black. At Michael Cohen’s hearing Wednesday, Congress’ black women were not only vocal about their opinions – Rep. Ayanna Pressley gave her own analysis to her Twitter followers – they were visual as well, as Rep. Stacey Plaskett’s ""eye roll"" at Rep. Jim Jordan’s comments showed.

But it was Stacey Abrams’ response for the Democrats to President Trump’s State of the Union address that most sets up the challenge for African Americans in the 2020 election, Barber said.

“Let’s be clear. Voter suppression is real. From making it harder to register and stay on the rolls, to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy,” she said in her response.

“The foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders, not where politicians pick their voters.”

Getting politicians like Northam to address racialized voter suppression and systemic racism are far more important that their apologies for racist photos taken long ago, Barber said.

“The most profoundly impactful racism is policy racism” that results in unfair economic, political and social outcomes for people of color, Barber said.

Huff believes that none of February’s low moments took the teeth out of what Black History Month represents. “Can we do a better job of reflecting on black history every day? he asked.

There are signs that we can.

Social media celebrations, like the mid-February kickoff of #ShareBlackStories on Instagram, encourage sharing of black achievement all year.

Chicago held a historic mayoral election on Feb. 26. After the April 2 runoff, either Lori Lightfoot or Toni Preckwinkle will become the city’s first black female mayor.

And that Klan-nostalgic newspaper editor? Sutton resigned, leaving Elecia Dexter, a black woman, to edit and publish the paper, a weekly act defying racism for years to come.

That wasn’t a bad way to finish the month at all."

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Amandla Stenberg brought the audience to their feet as she talked of being protected by the ancestors.

KiKi Layne evoked tears as she talked about having the comfort of Black women during an exciting but “terrifying” time.

Regina Hall kept people in stitches as she cracked jokes and celebrated her longevity in Hollywood. And Jenifer Lewis commanded everyone to honor those who came before them— while seemingly alluding to the arrest of Jussie Smollett for allegedly concocting a hoax about being attacked.

The actresses honored by Essence at the Black Women in Hollywood luncheon all riveted the room, albeit for different reasons, in front of a crowd that included Angela Bassett, Oscar-nominees Regina King and Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay, Diddy, Maxine Waters, Anita Hill and a host of other luminaries.

The annual event, hosted by Kelly Rowland, put the spotlight on Black women as Hollywood prepares for its biggest night — the Oscars — in an industry where Black women still can find themselves struggling to be heard and seen.

Layne is one of the lucky ones who hit a home run with her first movie, “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Her co-star in that movie, King, lovingly introduced the statuesque star by saying she felt Layne could be her daughter. When King began to tear up, she said: “I’m crying like I really am your mama!”

The tears didn’t stop when Layne accepted her trophy. She recounted praying that she would be featured in Essence magazine, and then, when they put her on the cover, she worried she wasn’t ready.

“(Then) it hit me that it was the perfect time for me to receive this honor because it is the very beginning for me, and being here in this room, receiving this award, it’s showing me that I’m not by myself in all of this,” she said.

“People ask me all the time, ‘How has all of this been’ or ‘your life is changing.’ I mean it’s extremely exciting, I’m so very grateful, but it’s also completely terrifying,” Lanye said, as she started to softly cry.

As the audience cheered her on, she reflected on how her success has encouraged others with “my chocolate skin and natural hair. . being represented in a way that this industry that we all know doesn’t always (tend) to represent us.”

“The Hate U Give” star Amandla Stenberg evoked the ancestors in her speech — from the grandmother that she never met, but felt a connection to, to others unknown that she said lift Black women up daily.

“Sometimes it may feel like we carry a lot of weight, but it is because we have been given roots that run deep into the earth,” she said. “The love and protection of our ancestors envelops us and transcends time itself. No matter what we face, we are wrapped in that protection.”

Not all of the speeches were heavy. Hall, who also starred with Stenberg in “The Hate U Give” and drew raves for her role in “Support the Girls,” had the audience in stitches as she recalled her 20-year journey in Hollywood, which started with a psychic who stopped her and told her she would be very successful — but years later.

“At 29 … you feel like the time is now. As women you feel like you have a clock,” she said. “I was like, ‘First of all, you are unsolicited!’ ”

She added: “I never had a quantum leap that was overnight. But there is so much that you learn in the journey, and so I’m grateful for that.”

Hall celebrated the friendships that helped her make it through, including with Sanaa Lathan, who co-starred with her in “The Best Man” and became one of her closest friends. She joked about the time Lathan told her she was going to get a job offer, but to keep it secret. When the offer never came, she called to find out what happened — and found it was for Regina King.

Hall talked so much so that Lathan jokingly tried to leave the stage. The afternoon’s final honoree, “black-ish” star Lewis, got up and shouted, “Sit your (butt) down!” That drew even more laughter.

Lewis, dubbed the “mother of Black Hollywood” combined comedy and wisdom in a poignant speech where she talked about overcoming the extreme poverty of her childhood, being molested and learning to live with being bipolar.

“I asked for help, and I got it, and now, as you can plainly see, in my skin. HAPPY! FREE! RICH! FAMOUS! I’M SO AMAZING!” she shouted to the cheers of the crowd.

While she was introduced by longtime friends Loretta Devine and Sheryl Lee Ralph, her award was given to her by her daughter, whom she adopted after being a mentor to her.

Lewis beamed as she looked at her: “I did something right!”

The Essence luncheon occurred the same day “Empire” star Smollett was in court to face allegations he concocted a hoax about being the victim of a racial and homophobic attack, and it was part of the chatter on the red carpet leading up to the event.

While Lewis never mentioned Smollett, she said, she was asked “what do you think” on the carpet and told reporters that she would have no comment.

But on stage, she began singing a song with the lyrics: “Before you lie to us, remember Rosa sat on that bus; before you tell your tale, remember Mandela sat in that jail,” and implored the audience to “remember the shoulders you stand on.”"

Police in California have a felony warrant out for the man who assaulted a student last week on the University of California-Berkeley campus.

Last week, Hayden Williams was helping to set up a recruitment table for the conservative campus group, Turning Point USA, when an argument started between two other men.

Williams began filming the argument with his phone. In another video taken by a bystander, one of the men is shown knocking over the recruitment table and punching Williams in the face.

The attacker left before police arrived, according to CBN News.

""College campuses have become increasingly unsafe for conservatives,"" Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, told Fox News.

""Our amazing Turning Point USA team was talking and then confronted by the hateful left which resulted in the assault and punching in the face just because of a difference of opinion. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA hat, this would be classified as a hate crime and all over every news channel.""

Williams told CBN News that he is not a member of the Turning Point group, but a Leadership Institute field representative. He says he is still recovering from the attack. He claims he was assaulted because he and other students had printed signs criticizing what he called the “Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax.”

""This time it was me. Tomorrow, it could be your kids, or grandkids,"" Williams said. ""So, this is a real problem that we need to address as a country.”

Donald Trump Jr., President Donald Trump’s son, also voiced his concern about the attack.

""Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Conservatives call out Berkeley police for lack of arrest one week after campus assault on activist.""

Commentary

Why do they do it?

The actor Jussie Smollett is not the first or even the latest to be accused of perpetrating a hoax while claiming to be a victim. Since the passage of hate crime legislation, such stories have mushroomed. In some cases, activists are charged with perpetrating the assault on themselves.

In an earlier case now coming to court, the accuser, Nikki Joly, a prominent transgender LGBTQ activist in Michigan, is charged with setting fire to his own home and, in the process, burning to death his two dogs and three cats.

Even since the Smollett case broke, a lesser-known person, Brazilian immigrant Rosiane Santos, was arrested for assaulting not herself or her pets, but a peaceful customer in a Mexican restaurant—because he was wearing a red MAGA hat. Not so much perpetrating a hoax as acting out a widely disseminated leftist delusion, she claimed that she was the victim, the one who was being bullied. She has since been arrested by ICE and faces deportation.

The reasons hoaxers give for their criminal behavior are varied.

They hate President Donald Trump and see anyone who supports him as a fair target for their aggression. We saw that in the response to the Kavanaugh hearings, to the Covington high school students, to government officials eating in restaurants or taking their children to school. All are fair game in this view, a perspective fed daily by the obsessive, nonstop barrage of media attacks widely referred to as Trump Derangement Syndrome. All three of the accused mentioned above referred to Trump and his supporters in justification for their behavior.

Or they want money or attention. Smollett is said to have cited insufficient pay for his work on the “Empire” show, at merely $65,000 an episode. Some, like Joly, seem to be seeking attention, feeling that they weren’t getting sufficient credit or support for themselves or their cause. Some clearly are troubled individuals with difficult childhoods, suggesting that issues of mental illness are involved or will be cited by defense lawyers in court. Others are impatient and discouraged that change movements are not going far enough and fast enough.

Incentives

Rather than speculate on psychological explanations, let’s look at the incentives for false claims of victimhood and the ways media, law, and policy in effect, though not intent, encourage them. To think in terms of incentives, imagine a Jew in Nazi Germany or a Black person in the South in Jim Crow days fabricating such claims. What would be the point? How would such false claims benefit the perpetrator of them, even if they were believed? In such circumstances, there is no incentive (or need) to fake persecution.

Fast forward to the United States today. There has been a decline in racism and stigma against homosexuality, in law and custom. There is decreasing tolerance of racist violence and violence against homosexuals. Given that credulous media and celebrities can be counted on to validate and amplify hate crime claims without regard to evidence, making such claims in itself can be a route to fame and even fortune.

There has been a mass of hate crime legislation at federal and state levels that results in treating assaults differently when they are motivated by bias against protected groups. For example, a white conservative, Hayden Williams, was beaten by a man who hated his politics. But such beatings, increasingly common on and off campuses, don’t fall under any hate crime law and elicit little outcry beyond conservative groups. Had the victim been a Black or LGBT person claiming to have been assaulted by a white man (even without the video evidence that Williams had), we might expect, as in Smollett’s case, immediate outrage and support for the alleged victim.

Such differential response on the basis of the kind of hate involved may itself encourage bogus claims. This is in the context of an identity politics that privileges certain kinds of victimhood. It is a politics that weaponizes victimhood, even among some of the most privileged people on the planet.

Victims of Their Own Success

If your identity, reinforced by media and campus or community leaders, is based on belonging to an oppressed group, then you have a problem if the oppression declines. The pressure has to be kept on, and sometimes allegations of “microaggression” are not enough, especially outside the campus hothouse environment.

According to the police investigative report, two church officials who had been working with Joly said that the LGBT activist had been frustrated that the controversy over gay rights had died down with the passage of the nondiscrimination law. They said Joly was disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade and Festival, which he had helped organize and which was held five days before the blaze that burned down his home and his pets, hadn’t received more attention or protests.

In these circumstances where status depends on victimhood, the appearance of respect or wealth may entail a loss of status. People may need frequent and even dramatic reminders of your victim status, even if you have to arrange them yourself. Liberal media and celebrities, gullible as ever despite falling for numerous hoaxes, stand ready to validate and amplify such allegations without troubling to investigate them first.

But there is a problem with “crying wolf.” If exposed, such hoaxes harm the cause that one is trying to further. They threaten to reduce the credibility of future claims of victimization, even when they are real and justified. That is why many progressives, when they hear of allegations like Smollett’s, definitely and publicly hope they are true, that the hoaxer was indeed assaulted in just the way he claims. Otherwise, such stunts damage the credibility of the news sources and pundits who gullibly accept the allegations, no matter how much they lack coherence or evidence.

“If true, these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation’s most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee,” Cummings wrote in a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Friday.

“I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation. I ask that you begin producing all responsive documents immediately, and I request that you begin scheduling transcribed interviews with each witness identified by the Committee,” Cummings wrote, giving Cipollone until March 4 to comply with his request.

Cummings first announced the security clearance investigation on Jan. 23 and on the same day sent a letter to Cipollone outlining the investigation and requesting a trove of documents as well as transcribed interviews with staff working in the White House’s personnel security office.

Cummings asked the White House to produce the documents by Feb. 6 and begin scheduled the interviews by Feb. 11. However, on Friday, Cummings said that none of the requests had been fulfilled.

Cummings also released written correspondence with the White House since the probe’s announcement, including a Feb. 25 letter in which Cipollone wrote that he was “committed to accommodating legitimate requests for information” but argued that there are “limits” on the authority Congress has to conduct oversight of decisions regarding security clearances within the executive office of the president.

Cipollone wrote that an earlier letter from the Democrat “overstates the Committee’s jurisdiction over the White House security clearance process and the historical oversight practices in this area.”

In his letter Friday, Cummings said the White House has “stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee.”

“The White House has refused to commit to providing any information regarding the security clearance of any specific White House official, and the president has asserted no constitutional privilege to withhold information from Congress,” Cummings wrote.

The letter followed the explosive Times report that Trump ordered Kelly to grant Kushner, one of his senior advisers, a top-secret security clearance in May despite concerns raised by the CIA and McGahn. The report contradicted statements Trump made to the Times in an interview last month in which he said he played no role in decisions related to Kushner’s clearance.

In an interview with Fox News, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayWhite House defends Trump's use of term as not racist Lincoln Project launches new ad hitting Trump over rally turnout Lincoln Project launches new ad hitting Trump over China policies MORE asserted Friday that Trump has the “absolute right” to involve himself in the security clearance process.

“We don’t discuss security clearances. I am not even going to discuss my own. But I will tell you that the president has the absolute right to do what was described,” Conway said.

Kushner is one of several current or former White House officials who have drawn scrutiny as a result of the clearances they received while working in the Trump administration. Cummings has asked for information related to Kushner’s clearance, as well as those of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter and onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn, as part of his investigation.

In a statement issued late Thursday in response to the Times’s report, Cummings issued a veiled threat to subpoena the documents from the White House if it doesn't comply with the probe.

“The Committee expects full compliance with its requests as soon as possible, or it may become necessary to consider alternative means to compel compliance,"" Cummings said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cummings's letter Friday.

That is to say, while awaiting future court appearances on a felony charge of making a false police report, the actor/singer’s team claimed that his now-notorious $3,500 check actually disproves claims of a staged attack. While that argument (that Smollett was paying two Nigerian brothers for fitness training, not for them to be accomplices) may or may not go down in court, those two Empire extras, Ola and Abel Osundairo, are now speaking out.

Through their attorney, the brothers released this statement to CBS Chicago:

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

The Chicago police have declared that they do not consider these brothers to be suspects. The Osundairos’ statement, while (probably purposely and necessarily) vague, seems to push back on Smollett’s explanation of why he wrote that check and sent them a Venmo payment. However, TMZ recently published receipts (and texts) that would support Smollett’s claims that he hired the brothers to help him lose 20 pounds for an upcoming video shoot. In other words, this case is as muddled as it was weeks ago, but all Smollett’s attorneys would need to do is create reasonable doubt to successfully defend him.

Smollett’s next Cook County court date will take place on March 14. However, he’s been permitted to leave Chicago and travel within the U.S. until that time.

Lawyers representing Jussie Smollett, the actor who apparently lied to the Chicago Police Department about an alleged hate crime, called him a “man of impeccable character and integrity.”

Before Smollett’s tale of being of a victim of an attack by two men yelling pro-Trump slogans fell apart, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), one of many who vouched for his character, blamed President Donald Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such an attack.

Waters said: “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on.”

This “man of impeccable character and integrity” appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” two weeks ago, where an oh-so-sympathetic Robin Roberts interviewed him. Smollett, at times tearing up, described the pain of being attacked by racist Trump-supporting homophobes. But he also described his second painful experience, that of being doubted.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black,” Smollett told Roberts, “I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett’s alleged hoax raised many interesting questions, one of which is this: How often do people lie to or about the police?

Larry Elder: Smollett’s Lies Expose a Culture of Lying to — and About — the Policehttps://t.co/kJho7jXR2j#JussieSmollettHoax — Larry Elder (@larryelder) February 28, 2019

In 2012, in the city of Rialto, California, with a population of approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, a follow-up analysis showed use-of-force incidents on the shifts with body cams were down 59 percent compared to those without cameras. But something else rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers—with or without body cams—were down about 88 percent from the prior year.

Why? It was not because officers changed their behavior. They applied the same training they used before body cams. It was the civilians who changed their behavior. It turned out that when civilians knew they were being recorded, they behaved better and stopped making false accusations. Civilians—aware that they might be taped—became less confrontational, followed officers’ instructions more readily and didn’t engage in the kind of resistant behavior as before, since random cops were required to use body cams. As a result, officers didn’t have to use the kind of force previously needed.

A 20-year veteran Rialto police officer told me: “Newspapers make you think that the cameras made us change what we did and how we went about our business ‘because the cops were being watched.’ That’s not true. The cameras made the civilians stop lying about us, reduced the mouthing-off and the kind of resistance we used to see.”

The city of Rialto isn’t alone in experiencing an almost 90-percent drop in officer complaints as a result of body cams.

A 2016 Cambridge University study of five police stations in the UK (in England and Northern Ireland) and two in the United States (including Rialto) found the same result. Complaints against the police fell 93 percent when some officers were randomly assigned body cams.

Jayne Sykes of the West Yorkshire Police Department said: “Anecdotally, in terms of bringing offenders to justice, our Crown Prosecution Service have said to us on numerous occasions that the video footage has tipped the ballot in favor of prosecution, whereas without it, they may not have been able to prosecute. And also, again anecdotally, we’re getting more early guilty pleas from suspects, which saves the victim the trauma of having to go to court and give evidence.”

Barack Ariel from Cambridge’s Institute of Criminology, one of the authors of Cambridge’s study, said that in the original Rialto study, the drop in complaints against police translated into a savings of $4 in complaint litigation for every $1 spent on the installation of body cams.

In the past two years, there have been several hate crimes later exposed as hoaxes. Nikki Joly, a Michigan LGBT activist lost his house in a 2017 fire, which killed his two dogs and three cats inside the home. Two days later, the activist exhorted his followers “to be angry, be very angry.”

The police quickly determined it was arson, while the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. As a result of his “plight,” the activist, called “citizen of the year” by a local newspaper, received $58,000 in donations. But a year later, the police charged the activist with setting the fire.

When Smollett’s hate crime claim imploded, Roberts called Smollett’s story “a setback for race relations.” About the assertion made by many blacks that cops engage in “systemic” or “structural” or “institutional” racism, one must ask this question: What impact do false accusations against cops play in pushing the “cops are out to get us” narrative?

Ola and Abel Osundairo told Chicago police Smollett paid them $3,500 to pull off the Jan. 29 street beatdown at 2 a.m. in near-zero temperatures, which the openly gay actor blamed on two masked men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, as well as ""This is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" No video was found of the alleged attack.

The brothers' attorney Gloria Schmidt released the following statement to WBBM-TV:

""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.""

Smollett was arrested Feb. 21 for filing a false police report — a felony — and posted $100,000 bond the same day. The charge against Smollett carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. He's due back in court March 14, WBBM added.

The actor has maintained his innocence and claimed the $3,500 check Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said was payment to the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack was actually for gym and nutrition training.

But Johnson reiterated the brothers' claim to ABC News' Robin Roberts and added that there is yet-to-be revealed evidence — ""physical evidence, video evidence, and testimony that just simply doesn't support [Smollett's] version of what happened.""

On Friday morning, Johnson spoke to WGN-TV on the heels of the Osundario brothers' statement and again expressed doubt about Smollett's check assertion: ""If I were going to buy a kilo of cocaine, I wouldn't put in the memo section 'for a kilo of cocaine.'""

Here's the WGN interview with Johnson:

What else?

Surveillance video came to light recently showing the Osundairo brothers in a store before the Jan. 29 alleged attack buying a red hat and ski masks, WBBM-TV reported.

The brothers also told detectives they and Smollett rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening, WBBM added.

""Empire"" executive producers announced last Friday that Smollett's character, Jamal, will be removed from the final two episodes of the season ""to avoid further disruption on set,"" according to a statement 20th Century Fox Television sent to TheBlaze.

The day before Smollett apologized to the show's cast and crew for any embarrassment his arrest and allegations against him may have caused — but he also told them he's innocent, CNN reported, citing an individual at the on-set meeting. That individual told CNN that ""they were shocked and dismayed that Smollett stuck to his story of innocence.""

TMZ cited sources who said many ""Empire"" actors are ""f***ing furious"" and believe that if Fox suits and ties don't fire Smollett that the 36-year-old should quit. The sources added to TMZ that some cast and crew members still believe Smollett's story."

Smollett posted bail earlier this week after Chicago police charged him with a felony for filing a false police report. The star of the Fox show Empire initially claimed that unknown attackers had beaten him, doused him with bleach and tied a rope around his neck as part of a racist, homophobic hate crime. He further alleged that the attack was part of a coordinated effort to intimidate and bash him which also included sending threatening letters to the Empire offices.

The backlash against Smollett has grown since a number of irregularities in his account of the attack have attracted questions about his story, and since the Osundario brothers provided evidence to police that Smollett paid them to stage the attack. Fox has dropped Smollett from the remaining episodes of Empire this season, as rumors about that the show’s producers would like to recast Smollett’s role."

The brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are believed to have helped Smollett orchestrate a hoax hate crime against himself, with Jussie Smollett telling police that the pair hurled homophobic and racist slurs, covered him in bleach, wrapped a noose around his neck, and declared “This is MAGA country!”

However, the two men have now admitted that they helped fake the incident after Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack in downtown Chicago in January, after surveillance footage captured them purchasing red hats and buying ski masks. According to reports, Smollett hoped the incident would help him secure a pay increase after he became dissatisfied with his $1 million-plus a year salary.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in a statement to CBS Chicago.

After cooperating with police investigations, the pair have since been released without charge. Jussie Smollett, meanwhile, was released from Cook County Jail last week after posting a $100,000 bond.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

He allegedly paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 to carry out the beating, instructing them beforehand on what to purchase and what time to strike. Abel and Ola Osundairo have been quiet since all the new information started to come out but now, they're issuing a public apology through their lawyer.

""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,"" said attorney Gloria Schmidt in a statement to CBS Chicago.

The brothers were initially arrested after they were caught on camera purchasing several of the items used in the attack. They were also seen leaving the scene of the crime. It is believed that Smollett staged the beating because he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on Empire. After visiting the FOX studios to plead his case, he was removed from his role on the show for the final two episodes of Empire's season."

USA TODAY obtained a statement from Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo Friday from their attorney, Chicago lawyer Gloria Schmidt.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the statement read.

The Osundairo brothers were originally considered suspects in the early-morning beating Smollett told police he suffered in a downtown Chicago neighborhood on Jan. 29.

Smollett told police his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referred to ""MAGA,"" President Trump's political slogan, Make America Great Again.

The brothers were arrested on Feb. 15, detained and interrogated for nearly 48 hours, and finally told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack. Police released them without charges.

Chicago police had insisted all along that Smollett was a crime victim until suddenly he wasn't: On Feb. 20, police charged him with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He pleaded not guilty.

On Feb. 21, at a blistering press conference, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack to look like a hate crime in order to ""take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Now the brothers are apologizing for their alleged role in the episode. Earlier, on Feb. 18, they also issued a statement in response to inaccurate media reports about their views and citizenship.

""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,"" the brothers told CBS in Chicago. ""We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

The brothers, who are bodybuilders and also work as trainers, were well acquainted with Smollett because Abel Osundairo, 25, worked on “Empire” as a stand-in for a character that was Smollett’s character’s love interest on the show, according to prosecutors.

The brothers worked out with Smollett and one served as his personal trainer, according to Smollett's attorneys. Prosecutors said Abel occasionally sold the drugs to Smollett.

Ola Osundairo also is an actor, having appeared on ""Chicago P.D."" and in ""The Worst Nightmare,"" according to his IMDb page."

""They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,"" attorney Gloria Schmidt told CNN about the remorse felt by her clients, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

After initially investigating the incident as a hate crime, Chicago police arrested Smollett last week and charged the singer/actor with a felony charge of disorderly conduct for what they said was the false claim that the men attacked him physically, put a noose-like rope around his neck and hurled racial and homophobic epithets at him during the alleged Jan. 29 incident. Smollett reportedly paid the brothers $3,500 to particpate in the attack, which Chicago's police superintendent Eddie Johnson said was orchestrated by Smollett because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on the long-running Fox musical drama.

The brothers are now cooperating with the Chicago PD's investigation and are no longer considered suspects in the case following their brief arrest last month. A spokesperson for Smollett's legal team could not be reached for comment at press time; Smollett's spokespeople have vehemently denied that the attack was staged. Following the actor's arrest and release on bail, Empire producers announced last week that Smollett would be written out of the upcoming season's final two episodes.

Given the racial and homophobic overtones of the alleged incident, the news that Smollett may have fabricated a hate crime for his own purposes met with swift rebuke last week. Among those taking the actor to task was Daily Show correspondent Jaboukie Young White, who said joked about the bizarre nature of the alleged crime while making a more serious point about how hurtful, and potentially dangerous, it is to the LGBTQ community.

“We need you to be part of the fight!” he said at the event, standing up with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Director of Communications Candace Owens. The event kicked off a series of parties surrounding the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside Washington, DC.

Kirk led students attending the event with chants of “USA! USA! USA!”

“Imagine doing that at a Democratic party?” Trump Jr. replied. “They’d kill you!”

Kimberly Guilfoyle attended the event with Donald Trump Jr. leading chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!”

“How much do we love our president and the first family?” she said as the crowd cheered. “Let’s show the president some of the love that the mainstream media won’t report!”

Donald Trump Jr. praised the young people for working to fight socialism in America:

He said:

If the last couple of weeks of what’s going on in US politics hasn’t shown you everything you need to know that you’re on the right side, with the post-term abortion nonsense or any of the crazy that’s being thrown out there, 93 trillion dollars and we’re going to pay people who don’t to work, you’re on the right side of this guys, history is going to remember you favorably.

The party was the physical meme-child of Turning Point USA’s newest hire of conservative journalist Benny Johnson as their content creator.

The organization reserved the entire Cadillac Ranch bar outside of the convention center featuring cardboard cutouts of American celebrities and political figures such as Ronald Reagan, Kanye West, Hillary Clinton, Tim Tebow, Tom Brady, Clint Eastwood, and Taylor Swift.

TVs at the bar played looped footage of the president and the first lady and a host of internet memes including cartoon astronauts

emphatically planting the American flag into the moon.

“This didn’t exist a few years ago,” Trump Jr. said, referring to the culture of the rising organization of young people. “Thank you for making me party and making people see what this party is all about.”

White House Communications director Bill Shine and his wife Darla were spotted as well as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and newly elected former Navy SEAL Congressman Dan Crenshaw.

Attendees Instagrammed pictures of the drink menu which included drinks like a “juice box” for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a “Mexico will pay for it” Tequila sunrise and a “Sarah Sanders” which was bourbon on the rocks.

“Jussie Smollett, THIS is MAGA country!” Kirk said as the crowd roared."

Speaking with TMZ exclusively, the openly-gay reality star made it very clear he believes the entire Jussie Smollett situation is nothing but a hoax. In the clip, Milan says the whole thing was “a plot to grow someone’s brand and give them a more powerful voice.” He followed that up by pointing out that Smollett’s Instagram following spiked tremendously after the incident.

“I mean look at his followers. His followers were one day at two million, and now I think it’s at like 5.8. To me, it still sounds like a hoax. It still sounds like a ploy. So my idea of the scenario has not changed because everything about the story has changed…except my opinion about it.”

He also explained that Jussie’s alleged hoax will only make things difficult for Black Gay men going forward affecting peoples perception of them and fearing no one will believe future victims of attacks. The bad blood between Christopher and Smollett is no secret. In a now-deleted Instagram post, Milan accused the actor of trying to tank his career blocking him from appearing on hit Fox television show Empire.

“This insecure, jealous queen did everything in their power to keep me from expanding my brand and having a new platform that would empower my reach & expand my ”Empire.'”

Jussie is already a walking gag at this point, but we are still holding out as more information continues to come out. Christoper is not alone as far as being skeptical about the whole situation with Cardi B and Smollett’s own cast member Terrence Howard reportedly not buying what went down in Chicago. Do you think Milan has a point about Smollett? Let us know how you feel on the situation in the comment section below.

However, if police allegations are accurate, these brothers from Nigeria also played a major role in duping the public just a few weeks ago.

And they're now here to say how very sorry they are for their actions.

These siblings have confessed to helping Smollett stage an attack against himself on the streets of Chicago early on the morning of January 29.

As you know doubt are aware of by now, the Empire actor told authorities after this incident that two white men assaulted him... tied a rope around his neck... doused him in bleach... and taunted him with racial and homophobic slurs.

Smollett went on Good Morning America to share his story, insisting on numerous occasions that this hate crime really did take place.

Alas, the Chicago Police Department does not agree.

Partly based on interview with the Osundairos, who worked as extras on Empire and who also trained Smollett, they have determined that Smollett ha been lying.

And they've charged him with falsifying a police report.

This is a felony that could land Smollett behind bars for three years.

It's unknown at this time just what legal penalty Abimbola and Olabinjo could pay for pretending to be Smollett's assailant, but their attorney spoke out on Friday morning and tried to garner some sympathy for her clients.

This was her statement:

""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.""

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers via check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

However, new questions have been raised about this payment and also about Smollett's motives.

On the latter front, some believe Smollett was seeking to become a LGBTQ martyr/hero by placing himself in the middle of an assault.

On the former front, the check Smollett cut to the siblings has actually been made public.

As you can see below, it's made out to Abimbola and it's in the amount of $3,500 -- but it was written six days before the attack and it listed ""personal training"" as the basis for the payment.

Smollett, of course, could have simply been covering his tracks via this personal training note.

But the check in and of itself doesn't appear to be evidence.

Moreover, the texts Smollett sent to one of these brothers also backs up his claim that they were simply helping him get in shape for a music video.

This is all a confusing, disturbing mess, that's about all we can say for certain right now.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that the assault ""was staged, the brothers had on gloves... where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Johnson went on to say Smollett owes everyone an apology for this farce.

But the actor's lawyers say that the police department is the one acting inappropriately here.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his team said after Johnson's address to the media, adding a few days ago:

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

Smollett told police in late January that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on January 29.

The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled, “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan Make America Great Again — before fleeing.

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. After turning himself in, a judge set Smollett’s bond for $100,000 and he was released from jail.

If convicted, he faces up to three years behind bars.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers via check for a “phony attack” in order to take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the “check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]” to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 “for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.”

He said the attack “was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) ‘staged attack’ where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett’s] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Smollett’s legal counsel told Fox News after the actor was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation “witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” his team continued.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

The brothers were initially held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett. Police said one of the men had worked on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met last month, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Schmidt said at the time.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

Smollett has a record that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

CHICAGO (AP) — Two brothers who told police that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett paid them $3,500 to help stage an attack on himself in Chicago say they regret their involvement in the incident.

Gloria Schmidt is the attorney for Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo . She issued a statement Thursday evening saying the men have “tremendous regret.”

Chicago police say Smollett hired the brothers, telling them to physically attack him, shout racist and homophobic slurs, douse him with a chemical and drape a noose around his neck.

Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly making a false police report. His attorneys say he’s innocent.

Schmidt says the men “understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

Earlier this week, officials said the investigation had ended, and police were seeking a felony arrest warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney Office.

The new announcement, which offered no details, was the latest in a series of delays and cryptic messages from authorities relating to the Feb. 19 attack, which was captured on video and clearly shows the face of the apparent attacker.

The new delay in the case drew the ire of the organization for which the activist, Hayden Williams, was manning the recruitment table.

“This is astonishing - what extra work needs to be done?” said Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, which plans to establish a chapter at Berkeley. “The assault was clearly captured on video. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat this case would be wrapped up by now, daily press conferences would be occurring, and arrests would have already happened.”

University officials, who have come under attack on social media and mostly conservative-leaning media outlets for the largely muted and delayed responses to the alleged assault, have denied they are handling the incident with less urgency because the apparent victim is conservative.

UC-BERKELEY EMPLOYEE CHEERED CAMPUS ASSAULT ON CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST; POTENTIAL SUSPECT ID'D

After the outcry about the university's response last week, UC-Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton said in a statement: ""Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason. That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.""

The Turning Point table that Berkeley student Guillermina Castro and Williams set up last week had recruitment materials and signs, including some that were pro-Donald Trump, and which were critical of false bias crime allegations, a reference to the actor Jussie Smollett.

Williams, 26, who is not a student but is a field representative for the conservative group The Leadership Institute, was approached by two men who, he said, reacted with antagonism to the signs. One of them punched Williams several times. The recruitment table was knocked over and signs were ripped, according to a UC-Berkeley alert on its website. Williams told Fox News last week the alleged attacker also threatened to shoot him.

On Friday, The Leadership Institute's newspaper, Campus Reform, reported that Williams has hired a lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, to pursue legal action against his alleged attacker. It quoted a Leadership Institute vice president, Bryan Bernys, as saying: ""Holding this attacker accountable by pursuing legal action is a step toward protecting free speech for conservatives on college campuses across the country. Conservatives have a right to free speech and shouldn’t be attacked for it – on or off college campuses.""

UC-Berkeley's media relations department said in a statement: “We have been in touch with the DA, and our police force is now doing some additional investigative work necessary for a determination of charges and/or the issuance of a warrant for the suspect’s arrest.”

The police department told Fox News they “don't have any information that can be released regarding the Sproul Plaza incident.”

A request from Fox News to speak with UC-Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett was denied. Both the police department and university officials referred reporters to the university’s media relations office, which provided the same prepared statement, which offered little insight as to why the investigation apparently has been reopened.

Last Friday, university police announced they had identified a suspect, and said he was not a student or affiliated in any way with the university. But the announcement, which said the investigation into the assault continued, did not name the man, or offer any other details.

Dan Mogulof, assistant vice chancellor in the Office of Communications and Public Affairs, had said the police department had concluded its investigation and was ""seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect.""

Two brothers who police say were paid by Empire actor Jussie Smollett to stage a fake attack have released a statement through their lawyer, saying they “regret” being involved.

The Nigerian brothers, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, sent out the statement to media via their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” it read.

Prosecutors say Smollett, 36, gave detailed instructions to Olabinjo and Osundairo, to stage attack against him in downtown Chicago. Prosecutors allege Smollett gave the brothers specific slurs to yell, telling them to shout “MAGA country,” and asking them to drape a rope around his neck.

Assistant state attorney Risa Lanier said at a news conference last week that Smollett even pointed out to the brothers a specific surveillance camera that he thought would capture footage of the Jan. 29 attack. Police say the camera was pointed another way during the staged attack.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel says hate crimes will never be tolerated in Chicago and charges accusing Smollett “will never trump Chicago’s collective spirit.”

Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 for allegedly filing a false police report that claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.

He was released from custody after posting bond, which a judge set at US$100,000. He has not spoken to reporters since he left the Cook County jail.

His legal team, however, continues to defend the actor, saying he’s a “young man of impeccable character.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election,” his lawyers said. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

During a bond hearing earlier that day, Smollett said little other than giving his name at the beginning.

Olabinjo and Osundairo were initially held for almost 48 hours, and they provided testimony to authorities for nearly two-and-a-half hours.

“You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” said Schmidt, revealing why the brothers weren’t seeking a plea deal or immunity.

Smollett, a gay black actor who has starred in the show “Empire,” claimed that on Jan. 29 he was assaulted by two men who insulted him with racial and homophobic slurs before putting a noose around his neck.

Police could find no evidence of the attack, and last month charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were at one time considered suspects in the attack the Smollett, but they later told police they had been paid $3,500 by the actor to stage the attack.

Their attorney this week issued their first public comments since Smollett was charged.

During a court hearing for Smollett, text messages between Smollett and the Osundairo brothers were read allegedly outlining how the 45-second attack was to be orchestrated.

Surveillance video was later found that showed the brothers buying supplies used in the attack, CBS reported.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said last month that the attack “was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the ‘staged attack’ where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on (Smollett’s) face was most likely self-inflicted,” according to Fox News.

On the day Smollett was charged, his lawyers issued a defense of the actor.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” they said in a statement, according to The Wrap. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Smollett’s case became a social media sensation, which will complicate efforts to resolve it in court, one attorney said.

“This is publicly known that it took so many resources away from Chicago’s police department that, how are you going to justify it with giving him a slap on the wrist?” Steven Goldman, a Chicago defense attorney, told CNN.

“So I think his case is going to be a little more difficult than just (a) regular, ordinary defendant’s case because its profile is so (high) right now,” he said.

Johnson has said he felt Chicago was unfairly slammed because of the incident.

“The city of Chicago has its issues, the Chicago Police Department has its issues with racism and excessive force and all of that, and I’m acutely aware of that,” the police superintendent said. “But we didn’t earn this particular incident, and I just refuse to let us have to take that shot if I have evidence to the contrary.

“So I just want people to understand that it’s a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department, so it’s my responsibility to ensure that the record gets set straight.”

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, in a statement obtained by CBS Chicago.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid Abel and Ola Osundairo $3,500 to pretend to attack him in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29, while posing as supporters of President Donald Trump.

Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 for filing a false police report.

The actor told police that two white men attacked him after recognizing him as a gay black man. The attackers shouted slurs and at one point yelled, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again,” Smollett claimed.

The actor was treated as a victim until the brothers, arrested on suspicion of being the attackers, revealed to detectives that the whole thing was a hoax, police officials said.

Smollett reportedly rehearsed the attack with the brothers several days prior to Jan. 29 and directed one to yell “This is MAGA country” to smear Trump supporters.

Previously, the Osundairos, who met Smollett while acting on “Empire” and one of whom became the actor’s personal trainer, said in a statement that they’re not racist.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they said on Feb. 18. “In due course, all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible,” added the brothers’ attorney, Schmidt.

However, two men who worked on the “Empire” show told Fox 32 that the brothers were homophobic. The witnesses said that they heard Abel use slurs on the set of the show in 2015.

“We were talking about friends and it was like ‘could you have a homosexual friend even though you were heterosexual?’ And he was just like ‘[expletive] no,’ he not gonna be friends with no[expletive],” said one witness, Ticarus Bunch, who played a prison guard on the show.

Speaking about another incident in which the brothers spoke with an extra who was openly gay, another witness, Lawrence Johnson, added: “These guys didn’t like it. They started picking with him. Moving his bag back and forth that he had on set with him.”

After the extra walked away, Johnson said Abel said: “I don’t want anybody like that around me. I can’t deal with that.”

The accounts dovetail with deleted tweets from Ola Osundairo’s Twitter account and a Smollett representative who told Fox reporter Rafer Weigel that Smollett’s defense team is going to go hard at the brothers’ credibility because their story “doesn’t add up.”

Motivation

Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that investigators believe Smollett’s motivation was dissatisfaction with his salary on “Empire.”

“This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” he told reporters after the actor was arrested.

“Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim,” Johnson added. “I’m offended by what’s happened and I’m also angry. This publicity stunt is a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve.”

Johnson said the wounds on Smollett’s face that were seen in a picture that circulated after the alleged attack were likely self-inflicted.

“They punched him a little but as far as we can tell, the scratches and bruises on his face were likely self-inflicted,” he said."

Schmidt represents Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

Chicago Police say Smollett paid $3,500 to orchestrate an attack on himself. He then claimed to police that he was attacked by two people who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and placed a rope around his neck.

Smollett — an actor on the Fox series “Empire” — was arrested shortly after the brothers were brought in for questioning by police and released without being charged.

Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said the brothers began to cooperate during the 47th hour of them being in custody.

Smollett, 36, has maintained his innocence.

At a press conference last week, Johnson asserted that the actor staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

“First, Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language,” Johnson said during the Feb 21 address. “When that didn’t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud in the process.”

Smollett, who was charged with disorderly conduct, was removed from the final two episodes of the fifth season of “Empire” after his arrest as the legal process plays out.

Instead, the conservative pundit — who rose to fame by appearing on Infowars and riding the coattails of a tweet from Kanye West — spent much of her time in front of the largest annual conservative gathering suggesting Democrats have a “vested interest in continuing racism.”

“What they care about is the politicking of fear, when the left results to calling me as I have read it, a racist, a sexist, a Nazi — because I really have the look going for me,” Owens said, acknowledging the criticism she received after saying at an event that Hitler’s nationalism was “fine,” but his invading of other countries was the problem.

“The words have completely lost their meaning,” she added.

Owens also gave a historically-questionable account of how Democrats have won over black voters — à la, Dinesh D’Souza — and it all has to do with the entertainment industry.

“How on earth is it possible that the party that instituted slavery and Jim Crow laws, racial terrorism in the KKK, has the black vote? How is it possible? We gave up culture, the right gave up culture. That’s how it’s possible. That’s how the left was able to do this. We gave up culture. Over the course of the last 50 or 60 years, it seems we’ve given up influencing pop culture altogether on the right.”

She continued by suggesting Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is a person of color, thinks “black people are stupid” and is only appealing to the community “by saying I smoked pot and I listen to hip-hop.”

“How insulting is that?” Owens said, before claiming Hillary Clinton only “offered… hot sauce as a reason to vote for her” — referencing the criticism Clinton faced for discussing hot sauce on a black radio show, despite her affinity for hot sauce and spicy foods being known for years.

“The secret [to winning over black voters] is I simply tell them the truth,” she continued. “Truth number one, America is not a racist country. The people that continue to tell us that have a vested interest in racism.”

Owens concluded by riffing about actor Jussie Smollett‘s allegedly staged hate crime, accusing Democrats of “importing Nigerians to come do racist acts in this country.”

“Jussie Smollett, right? This is MAGA country?” She asked as the crowd egged her on. “No, this is your prison cell and I hope you rot in it, Jussie.”

The brothers issued an apology Thursday and said they ""regret"" their actions.

""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,"" the brothers' attorney, Gloria Schimidt, said in a statement to Chicago CBS affiliate CBS 2.

The brothers told police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out a staged attack against him outside his Chicago apartment building in January.

After Smollett told police he was attacked by two masked men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, police initially treated the investigation as a hate crime — but the scope of the investigation changed quickly when the brothers accused Smollett of playing a role in the hoax.

Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct. He was released on $100,000 bail following a court date last week and has been officially removed from Empire's final episodes of its current season.

Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson told Good Morning America earlier this week that Smollett ""damaged"" Chicago's reputation with his allegedly false claims.

""I just want people to understand that's a damaging thing to do to a city and to a police department,"" Johnson said.

""I just hope people don't judge other folks that are victims of these types of crimes because this is just one particular incident. That's the damaging part of it,"" he continued. ""You damage the city's reputation. We don't need any help with that; we really don't.""

He also said that police have ""a lot more evidence that hasn't been presented yet that doesn't support [Smollett's] version that he gave us.""

""There's still a lot of physical evidence, video evidence and testimony that just simply doesn't support his version of what happened,"" Johnson said Monday morning.

Despite a report from TMZ that said the $3,500 check Smollett issued the Osundairo brothers was for personal training purposes, Johnson maintained in his interview that the check was to ""carry out this incident.""

Smollett, meanwhile, has denied that he played a role in carrying out the alleged hoax. Police said they believe Smollett's motive was to get attention, as he was allegedly unhappy with his Empire salary."

The two Nigerian-Americans have claimed the “Empire” actor hired them to stage the Jan. 29 attack. They have now issued an apology.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, said in a brief statement to CNN.com.

The statement did not address allegations of being homophobic on the set of “Empire” or anti-gay tweets they deleted.

The brothers released the following statement when news broke they were involved in the attack: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Their past may contradict that statement.

In addition, the Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers told them the attack against Smollett was orchestrated by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, earlier this week, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reported, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

The brothers were also on video appearing to buy items allegedly used for the attack.

We hope the truth comes out.

Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo’s attorney released a statement to CBS Chicago, saying that the two men felt “tremendous regret” for being involved in the situation. In addition to that, they also apologized for the negative impact it may have had on people across the country, especially for those who were victims of hate crimes.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” the statement read.

As we reported, the two were captured in surveillance video purchasing a red hat and ski masks. Chicago police said the community helped them catch the men by giving officers access to surveillance cameras in the neighborhood. Ola and Abel Osundairo was arrested and admitted that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage an attack outside his Streeterville apartment building last month.

Smollett, who initially reported it was two white men who attacked him, was arrested but later released from the Cook County Jail last week after posting bond. He is charged with a felony for filing a false police report. He is due back in court on March 14.

Abindola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo were, briefly, suspects in the Jan. 29 attack that Smollett described as racist and homophobic. Investigators say it was, in fact, a hoax intended to generate publicity for the “Empire” actor, who was seeking a higher salary.

Cook County prosecutors have charged Smollett with felony disorderly conduct, the charge used for filing a false police report.

Prosecutors say Smollett enlisted the help of the brothers, one of whom worked out with the actor and had been a stand-in on “Empire.” Smollett later wrote a check for $3,500 to one of the brothers, prosecutors say.

The brothers were detained and then released, without being charged.

The apology tour for Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime “hoax” has begun — but not by the actor who police say orchestrated it.

The brothers whom the Empire star allegedly paid to stage a “bogus” attack against him have issued a public apology through their attorney on Thursday.

Abel and Ola Osundairo’s lawyer told CBS Chicago that the two felt “tremendous regret” for being involved with the situation, and apologize for the negative impact it had on minority groups across the country.

The statement read:

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

According to Chicago Police, Smollett is not one of those victims, despite his persistent claims that he was attacked by two masked men on the streets of Chicago in late January.

Authorities believe the actor paid the Osundairo brothers. — who reportedly knew the 36-year-old from working on the FOX drama and going to the same gym — to stage a hate crime attack against him because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

Text messages between Smollett and Abel and Ola that were read in court reportedly described how the 45-second street performance would allegedly be orchestrated.

As we reported, Smollett was arrested on February 21 and released after posting his $100,000 bond. He’s currently facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct and looking at up to three years in prison. His next hearing is set for March 14.

It’s unclear at this time if the brothers Osundario will face any charges.

Mark Meadows at Michael Cohen‘s congressional hearing in a futile attempt to prove that Trump isn’t racist. She is now defending herself — on Fox News, of course.

“I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again. The president does not see color, race, creed, religion. What he sees is success and failure,” the hacks at “Fox & Friends” heard Patton tell them on Thursday. “Trump has time and time again done so much for the Black community and I’m proud to be a part of it.”

Of course, no one asked her what he has done for the Black community.

She also attacked Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who said using Patton as a stunt was “racism in itself.” Patton responded, “What I’d like to ask the congresswoman from Michigan is you know, why does she take the word of a self-confessed perjurer, and criminally convicted white man, over a Black female who is highly educated, rose up through the ranks of one of the most competitive companies in real estate, spoke before 25 million people at the Republican National Convention and now works in one of the most historic administrations in history?”

Patton also added, “That’s more racist than being put up there as a ‘prop,'” she added. Watch the foolishness below:

In case you missed it, at Cohen’s hearing Meadows babbled,“Lynne Patton says she would not work for a man who is racist… She disagrees with you. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was a racist.” Meadows, who somehow believes Patton represents all African Americans, asked, “How do you reconcile the two of those?”

As Patton silently stood behind Meadows, willingly debasing herself even more than she already has being part of the Trump administration, Cohen said, “Ask Ms. Patton how many Black people are executives at the Trump Organization? The answer is zero.”

Watch below:

""Ask Ms Patton how many black people are executives at the Trump Organization? The answer is zero,"" Cohen says. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/UV915dYEbV — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 27, 2019

During Cohen’s opening remarks he said about Trump, “He is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ‘shitholes.’ In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’ This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.”

He continued, “While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only Black people could live that way. And, he told me that Black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.”

Patton clearly doesn’t care. In January of last year, she attacked another Black woman, April Ryan, calling her Miss Piggy:

Patton will clearly do all that she can to align herself with white supremacy.

Now, the wealthy Democratic donor is being sued by Latisha Nixon, the mother of Gemmel Moore, who is a 26-year-old who was found dead in Buck’s home on July 27, 2017.

Nixon filed a wrongful death lawsuit, “alleging that he injected her son with a lethal dose of crystal methamphetamine,” CNN.com reported. “The complaint describes Buck as a wealthy white man who ‘had a predatory and injurious system of soliciting Black men and watching them cling to life.’ It accuses him of wrongful death, sexual battery and assault and says he was not prosecuted ‘because he is white, and because Mr. Moore was Black.'”

Gemmel Moore's family files suit against Ed Buck and DA. https://t.co/JXyhZFDAdN pic.twitter.com/Rg1JsfzieS — AFROPUNK (@afropunk) February 27, 2019

Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who is a Black woman, has declined to charge Buck. Her office refused to comment to CNN.com on the last suit.

Seymour Amster, Buck’s attorney, said, “On behalf of Mr. Buck we categorically deny all allegations of wrongdoing and look forward to litigating this matter in a court of law,” according to NBC News.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Moore wrote in a journal a few months before he died that he was using drugs and “Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of chrystal [sic] meth.”

On July 4 of 2017, 23 days before Moore died, an escort reported Buck to authorities for drugging Black men, but nothing was done. After Moore died, Buck’s apartment was searched. Law enforcement allegedly “found the following items in Buck’s two-bedroom apartment: 24 syringes with brown residue, five glass pipes with white residue and burn marks, a plastic straw with possible white residue, clear plastic bags with white powdery residue and a clear plastic bag with a ‘piece of crystal-like substance.'”

And in early January of this year, 55-year-old Timothy Dean, who allegedly worked at Saks Fifth Avenue, died at Buck’s home. See his photo below:

Dean reportedly warned other people to say away from Buck. He claimed the 64-year-old had a fetish for men wearing white long johns and once said, “Don’t go in that house because you might never come back.” When the first Black man was found dead in Buck’s home, he allegedly said Buck was the “devil” and that “This might be it for Ed Buck.”

It’s not clear why Dean went to Buck’s home the night he died.

It would seem that Buck’s money and privilege have allowed him to avoid jail time.

Rightfully so.

From the racist “motif” choices of the world’s leading fashion houses to the allegedly false allegations and subsequent arrest of actor Jussie Smollett, to the indictment of singer, songwriter, and serial sexual predator R. Kelly, February 2019 has been exhausting.

More than a few of us will be happy to see this shortest month of the year draw to a close.

Between creating, commenting and sharing a seemingly endless stream of memes featuring Smollett as the butt of jokes, some on black social media are calling for a do-over of sorts. Perhaps Black America should try again during some other month this year to make right all that went wrong.

Up to print time, these at best, half-hearted attempts at black formation and synchronization on the matter have and will continue to fall short.

The now month-long observance which Carter G. Woodson began in 1919 as Negro History Week was neither decided by consensus nor given to Black America because it is the shortest month of the year. The son of former slaves, Woodson was the second African American to obtain a Ph.D. degree from Harvard University.

Nobody ever freely gave black people in this country anything more than a hard time, including Woodson who pioneered the celebration of “Negro History Week” during the second week of February in 1926, to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

It’s understandable that black folks have been scurrying to salvage what is left of this year’s observance. According to Black Twitter, plans for #BlackHistorySummer are already underway.

Then came the Oscars when God, it seemed, finally heard the prayers of Black America.

Queen Mother Cicely Tyson, and the glory of every black mother ever arrived at Vanity Fair’s red carpet on the arm on B. Michael.

Pose’s Billy Porter wowed us with a “sharply tailored tuxedo jacket overtop a full-skirted strapless velvet gown” which stopped a swooning Glenn Close in her tracks.

Lisa Bonet also summarily shut down the request of a red carpet reporter for her husband and actor Jason Momoa to do the “haka,” a sacred traditional dance of the Maori people—for the pleasure of her white gaze. In short, Lady Bonet said there wasn’t going to be any “tribal” Magic Mike foolery in this dancerie.

And this was before the Oscars had even begun. Then they did. We won. And we kept on winning!

One of our favorite teenage actresses, Regina King, won her first-ever Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Barry Jenkins’ “If Beale Street Could Talk.”

Mahershala Ali, who won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Jenkins’ “Moonlight” in 2017, secured his second for Best Supporting actor in “Green Book.” Ali joined Denzel Washington as the second Black actor to receive two competitive Academy Awards in his career.

Veteran filmmaker Spike Lee, regaled in purple as an homage to the late Prince—replete with custom gold Air Jordan 1s—lept into the welcoming arms of his Morehouse College brother Samuel L. Jackson while claiming his his-ever Oscar for co-writing “BlacKkKlansman.”

Then came “Black Panther.”

Hampton University alumna Ruth E. Carter, who got her start in Spike Lee’s “School Daze,” took home her first-ever Oscar for Best Costume Design.

For her creation of the mythical city of Wakanda, Hannah Beachler won the Oscar for Best Production Design.

Both were the first-ever African-American women to win their categories, and also represent the first to win in a non-acting category since Irene Cara in 1984.

Yet, because Wakanda isn’t real, the Academy Awards reminded us our place on the totem of whiteness with its selection of “Green Book” as Best Picture.

Ostensibly, “Green Book” should have been the story of black, queer classical pianist Dr. Donald Shirley and his racist, white driver Tony “Lip” Vallelonga, set against the backdrop of the Jim Crow Deep South.

In dedicating the majority of its storytelling to the ways in which Shirley’s relationship with a racist Vallelonga is transformed through proximity, audiences were treated to another show of white redemption.

This is a seductive narrative—the notion of the white savior in films—for all Americans who want to believe that black people have the power to love white people out of the power and privilege they enjoy as a result of racism.

Unfortunately, this scenario reveals less about how to change the attitudes of racists than it does about the deeply systemic issues present in modern storytelling itself.

That Ali, who played Shirley, was billed supporting actor in a movie about Shirley should have signaled for Ali that those involved were not really concerned with ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of Shirley’s story. Hell, the film’s writing team didn’t even consult Shirley’s very much alive relatives.

And that is precisely why when the movie’s all-white-male creator-team assembled center stage to claim the Academy’s arguably most coveted prize—Best Picture—Black America won the battle, but lost the war.

Despite an awards show too black to be dubbed #OscarsSoWhite, white Hollywood is persistent in its attempts to dangerously absolve itself and white America from embracing—and truly celebrating—narratives of and by black people. In the end, whiteness has been centered as rightness—yet again.

So until next year, my People, or maybe #BlackHistorySummer [smirks in Chadwick Bozeman].

But the stunning arrest of actor Jussie Smollett has put a cloud over the future of the show, which will likely carry on without him.

Smollett, the black and gay co-star of “Empire,” went from hate crime victim to accused felon Thursday as Chicago police charged him with filing a false police report in which he claimed to have been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack. Two brothers told the police they were acquaintances of Smollett through the show and that the actor hired them for $3,500 to stage the attack as an attention-generating stunt.

“This announcement today recognizes that ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press briefing after the actor surrendered. Johnson said Smollett allegedly orchestrated the incident because he was dissatisfied with his salary for his work on “Empire.”

The shocking turnabout could be the downfall of a well-liked TV star and risks damaging a valuable asset that Fox expected to have on its primetime schedule for at least another two years."

The statements were of particular interest because when the brothers were first brought in for questioning, they were quick to release a statement saying, ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

“They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” read a statement from their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, as reported by Fox News.

The Osundairo brothers were first considered persons of interest in the case. However, after they were brought in for questioning by Chicago police, the focus of the investigation shifted to Smollett. The 36-year-old Empire cast member was arrested on February 21 on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Smollett maintains that he is innocent of all charges. As CNN also notes, on the day of his arrest, he returned to the set of Empire to apologize to the cast and crew for negative attention the story had attracted and to assert that he did not stage the attack. He was later suspended from the show and was axed from the last two episodes of the upcoming season.

Insiders on Smollett’s side claim that he has evidence to prove that he’s telling the truth. TMZ previously reported that the check he allegedly used to pay for the attack states that the payment was for a nutrition program on its memo line. Their sources from the actor’s camp claim that Jussie wanted to lose weight ahead of a video shoot for his song, “Don’t Go,” where he planned to be shirtless. According to TMZ, there are also text messages which show Smollett communicating with Abel Osundairo about meal and exercise plans.

Police have also accused Jussie Smollett of sending himself a racist letter before the attack. But as TMZ notes, the FBI has not definitively concluded that he sent the letter.

Smollett was released on bail and he now awaits his first day in court on March 14. On the day he was arrested, his defense team issued a statement decrying the actions of the Chicago Police Department.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election,” the statement read, as published by Yahoo News. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were arrested in mid-February at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport upon their return to the U.S. from a trip to Nigeria, where they traveled immediately after the reported attack on Smollett. They were released without charges, provided testimony about the incident to a grand jury, and reportedly continue to cooperate with investigators.

Smollett reportedly claimed that two men attacked him on the early morning hours of January 29 in Chicago, shouting homophobic and racial slurs before tying a rope around his neck. Smollett was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly falsifying a police report. Chicago police said in a press conference following Smollett’s arrest that they believe he paid the brothers $3,500 to orchestrate the attack, but subsequent reports have shown that Smollett wrote a memo on the check he gave them indicating the money was for a nutrition and fitness program.

Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the Osundairo brothers, said in a statement to CNN that her clients expressed “tremendous regret” for their role in the incident.

“They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” Schmidt said.

Smollett has not commented publicly since his arrest, and his lawyers have said that he maintains his innocence. The actor is currently free on bail and due back in court on March 14.

At a press conference later that morning, speaking of the staged racist and homophobic attack, Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson said, “‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Johnson said “This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked.”

Added Johnson: “I’m left hanging my head and asking why.

“I’m also concerned about what this means moving forward for hate crimes,” said Johnson. “My concern is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”

Johnson said that police have the $3,500 check that Smollett wrote to the brothers to pay them for the staged attack.

Seems the 9/11 false flag should have come with a warning: DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME! People who stage their own personal mini-false-flags tend to get caught. Take Jussie Smollett. Please.

There is however one type of personal mini-false-flag that may not be so hard to get away with, especially in the “me too” era: false allegations of sexual assault. After all, if Jemma Beale (read about her below) could falsely accuse 15 different men of rape and get away with it for years, who COULDN”T get away with it, at least for awhile?

A Tale of Two Hoaxes

by Jonathan Revusky, HeresyCentral.is

According to the Chinese lunar calendar, we are now in the Year of the Pig. However, this is surely the Decade and most probably the Century of Bullshit. As such, there are a huge number of hoaxes out there, too many to count. However, some of them, a select few, for whatever reasons, receive far more attention than the rest. A recent hoax, perpetrated (or attempted, rather) by one Jussie Smollett really seems to have hit the sweet spot.

Jussie Smollett, who is actually biracial (and thus, a particularly good stand-in for Trump’s predecessor in the White House) was initially portrayed as the innocent victim of racist Trump supporting thugs. However, soon there was narrative breakdown.

Since the story broke some weeks ago, readers of the Unz Review have been regaled with an average of two articles a day about Jussie, the man of of the hour. As I write these lines, Unz’s prolific racialist blogger, Steve Sailer has devoted thirty-two blog posts to this latest hate hoax, more than one a day since the story broke.

You see, just as there are worthy victims and unworthy ones, so it is with hoaxes. So I thought to remedy the situation a bit by bringing to your attention one of the hoaxes deemed (by whoever decides these things) to be less worthy. This one did not take place in the U.S. of A., but in merry old England.

That Obscure Object of Desire

The story broke in the British press in the summer of 2017, but I only came across it some months later. Jemma Beale, a 25-year-old young lady (perhaps using the term “lady” rather loosely) was sentenced to 10 years in prison for falsely accusing 15 (!) different men of rape and sexual assault over a multi-year period.

Though this case has various noteworthy aspects, the first that is bound to jump out at a reader pertains to Ms. Beale’s physical charms. My own first reaction to this was one of amazement. Surely, I thought, anybody with eyes to see would have had immediate doubts about this woman’s claims of being a serial rape victim!

Still, beauty is a subjective matter, so I sought out a second opinion. I showed some of the photos to my 13-year-old daughter and asked her whether she believed this woman had been raped so many times.

“I don’t think so, Papi.”

“Really? Why not?”

“She is really very ugly, Papi.”

To be fair, the relevant authorities, to their credit, did eventually figure this out also, but it took them quite a bit longer. Thus, one of the falsely accused, Somali-born Mahad Cassim, served two years and nine months of a seven-year prison sentence for the crime of defiling this particular English rose.

From the Guardian, Britain’s newspaper of record, we have:

Sentencing her on Thursday, the judge, Nicholas Loraine-Smith, said: “This trial has revealed, what was then not obvious, that you are a very, very convincing liar… (my emphasis)

No mention of anybody having been very, very gullible. Of course not. It would be grossly unfair to reproach any of them for having been duped. Obviously, the problem is solely that Jemma is such a very convincing liar.

Though I have never personally met Jemma Beale and have no desire to do so, I do not believe that the story is principally about Jemma’s great talent for lying. Nor is it really about the gullibility of the specific local authorities who handled the case. That various young men could have their lives ruined based on this deranged woman’s storytelling tells us something more general about the pathologies of the society in which we live. I suspect that the Jemma Beale story is only possible in this current-day petri dish of weaponized feminism, political correctness, suppressed (and not so suppressed) racism, and generalized nuttiness.

Narrative and Counternarrative, the “Man bites dog” theory

A famous adage has it that it is not news when a dog bites a man, but when the man bites the dog… Or in other words, the events that are newsworthy are those that run counter to the conventional narrative. I have wondered of late whether this is really quite true. On the one hand, the counternarrative “man bites dog” story tends to pique one’s curiosity more than the humdrum “dog bites man”. But then, on the other hand, many (or most?) people are not particularly interested in having their belief system challenged. They have certain narratives running through their heads and they are constantly seeking to confirm them. Such people have a tendency to gravitate towards news sources that run stories that bolster their existing prejudices. Such outlets are highly ideological, which is basically another way of saying that they are heavily invested in certain narratives. That in turn amounts to saying that they have a vested interest in suppressing or downplaying inconvenient counternarratives.

The dominant feminist discourse on rape is that the crime is very underreported; few women will press charges, since, in our sexist society, the deck is stacked against rape victims. However, I daresay that all this would come as news to Jemma Beale’s victims. For example, another of the men whom Jemma Beale falsely accused, one Noam Shahzad, avoided the aforementioned Mr. Cassim’s plight by fleeing to Pakistan, where doubtless, he has extended family. Clearly, Mr. Shahzad did not harbor any illusions that the British legal system was skewed in his favor. Quite the contrary. He reasoned, probably correctly, that he didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell. So…

Run, baby, run!

In any case, if the feminist narrative is largely about portraying women as victims, the Jemma Beale story, a clear case of a woman victimizing men, is a rather inconvenient counternarrative. Actually, it goes beyond that; effectively, this obese lesbian, with the full complicity of British law enforcement and courts, was able to wield this feminist victimization narrative as a weapon to victimize innocent men. What we have here, at least in this instance, is a weaponized victimization narrative.

Now, obviously, all of this is a question of perspective. For the feminists pushing a certain world view in which women are always the victim, the Jemma Beale story is clearly rather inconvenient. However, if you are opposed to the feminist ideology, or you feel, at the very least, that the whole thing has gone way too far, and it is, increasingly that men are being unfairly demonized, then you would think that such a case provides some much needed balance to the discussion.

Narrative Crossfire

The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. ​ George Orwell, “Notes on Nationalism”

Based on the foregoing considerations, one would expect that the right-wing anti-PC sorts of websites would have had a field day with the Jemma Beale case. Surely, when your publication is catering to the disgruntled angry white man demographic, you wouldn’t miss something this good, would you? You’d seize any opportunity to stick it to those feminists, right?

So I was quite interested in how such outlets presented this story and one of the first sites I thought to check was Breitbart. On Google, I tried the search string:

Jemma Beale site:breitbart.com

It turned up absolutely no results. Zero. Zilch. It turns out that Breitbart simply ignored this story completely. Note, by the way, that this is not because Breitbart is an American outfit, and thus, largely unaware of what happens in Britain. That might have been true once, but Breitbart has had a non-virtual presence, an actual physical office, Breitbart London, since 2014. All of their London based people must have known about the Jemma Beale story since it was all over the London tabloids that they would see on the streets. So I think they must have made a conscious decision, however juicy the story is, not to cover it.

Well, there is no great mystery here. Breitbart is an outlet that largely exists to present a very right-wing Zionist world view. A very large part of that is unrelenting, rabid Islamophobia. Thus, Breitbart is a news outlet (using the term rather loosely) that is heavily invested in a set of Islamophobic narratives. In the period of over a year running up to when the Jemma Beale case broke, Breitbart went whole hog on the narrative of a rape epidemic allegedly taking place in Europe, being attributed to Muslim refugees. So, finally, the Jemma Beale story is counternarrative for them, just as it is for the radical feminists — albeit for entirely different reasons!

The Jemma Beale story is quite fascinating and I forwarded it to various people with whom I correspond. As juicy as it is, none of them had ever heard of the story. I pondered this for a while and came to the conclusion that this is a case of what one could call narrative crossfire. While people on the cultural left would not find the story ideologically useful for obvious reasons, the case of those on the alt-right is more nuanced. The story of a woman mounting a hate hoax by crying rape is a great story for them, but a white girl falsely accusing Muslim men of raping her is something they would tend to downplay. Actually, they didn’t just downplay it. They simply ignored the story completely. A search for any reference to Jemma Beale on the Unz Review also comes up with nothing.

Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine that the Jemma Beale story is the same in all respects except for the racial backgrounds of the people involved. Now Jemma is an obese black woman who falsely accused a number of white English lads of raping her, causing at least one of them to spend years in prison.

Would the readership of Breitbart or the Unz Review be unaware of that story? Come to think of it, ideally, the obese false accuser, besides being Black, would also be Muslim.

You hit the trifecta, baby!

Though it cannot be absolutely proven, I daresay that all the Alt-Right bloggers, people like Steve Sailer and the rest, would go absolutely apeshit over this modified version of the story. I think it would easily take the limelight away from Jussie Smollett. It would be like… Jussie who?

But that is still just a thought experiment. As it is, just about nobody has heard of Jemma Beale, any more than they have heard of Sophie Pointon, the lily white English girl who falsely accused a Muslim taxi driver of sexually molesting her. Apparently, the drunken Sophie was incensed that the Pakistani cabby did not want to accept her ten pound note in payment because it was drenched in the oil of the greasy doner kebab she had been eating during the ride. (I myself have observed that even the most virulently racist English people just looove their doner kebab.)

Sophie was, at least, a more credible sexual assault victim than Jemma Beale.

The problem was, however, that the cab’s GPS gadget left an electronic record of the cab trip that revealed that Sophie was lying in various particulars. So now Sophie suffered from narrative breakdown. I have no idea whether Ms. Pointon is still in prison.

Perhaps needless to say, a search for this story on Breitbart also yields zero hits:

“Pointon” site:breitbart.com

The readership of Unz Review is also no more likely to have heard of the Sophie Pointon case than Jemma Beale. A search for either incident produces no search results there either. It seems that the writers there, by and large, only cover the hate hoaxes that they feel like covering.

What to Do?

I guess it is inevitable that Alt-Right writers and venues will go on endlessly about Jussie Smollett but hardly mention Jemma Beale. Of course, writers on the other end of the political spectrum can be equally selective in what they tell you about. This is regrettable but there is not much to be done about it.

From the perspective of a reader, one who wants to be well informed, there is a clear lesson in this tale of two hoaxes: one should be very wary of relying solely on information sources that are aligned with one particular ideological perspective. If you want to learn about the world, you should not avoid material that will challenge your preconceived ideas; you should even seek it out. A white nationalist should not just read Occidental Observer but should read Black Agenda Report as well — at least occasionally. A person with right-wing republican leanings should read this sort of left-wing site as well as their usual right-wing fare. You see, even if you don’t agree with their perspectives, these sites will inform you of facts that you would simply not otherwise know.

Of course, the above is based on the assumption that you are seeking the truth. For those of you who do not at all mind that your habitual information sources go on endlessly about Jussie Smollett but don’t mention a single word about Jemma Beale, I don’t have any particular advice. If what you want is simply to reinforce your existing world view, then just keep on doing whatever you’re doing, I guess.

CHICAGO POLICE BLAST JUSSIE SMOLLETT 'PHONY ATTACK': 'BOGUS POLICE REPORTS CAUSE REAL HARM'

Smollett told police in late January that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The actor, who is black and gay, said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" – an apparent reference to President Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" – before fleeing.

But that isn't how police say it all went down.

SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS DENY HE PLANNED ATTACK AFTER CHICAGO COPS CLAIM HE'S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A VICTIM IN CASE

Smollett, who is accused of filing a false police report, was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. After turning himself in, a judge set Smollett's bond for $100,000 and he was released from jail. If convicted, he faces up to three years behind bars.

According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers via check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference last month that police found the ""check that [Smollett] used to pay [two brothers]"" to fake the beating, adding he paid them $3,500 ""for the two of them in total, and then $500 upon return.""

JUSSIE SMOLLETT DIDN'T GIVE BRETT KAVANAUGH THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BUT ASKS FOR IT NOW

He said the attack ""was staged, the brothers had on gloves during the (air quotes) 'staged attack' where they punched him a little, but as far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on [Smollett's] face was most likely self-inflicted.”

Smollett's legal counsel told Fox News after the actor was accused of filing the fake police report that the nation ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,"" his team continued.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

The brothers were initially held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett. Police said one of the men had worked on ""Empire,"" and Smollett's attorneys said one of the men is the actor's personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, ""Sum of My Music,"" last year.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS BLAST AUTHORITIES, SAY ACTOR WAS 'BETRAYED BY A SYSTEM THAT WANTS TO SKIP DUE PROCESS'

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met last month, the brothers' attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

""There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we're going to correct this,"" Schmidt said at the time.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. ""You don't need immunity when you have the truth,"" she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

According to E! News, Wendy Williams will likely have to address her absence in some form. She’s been gone for weeks, and the rumor mill has been working overtime about her personal life, marriage, and health issues.

Wendy has always been pretty open with her fans, discussing things about her life on television in the past, such as her husband’s affair and relationship issues with her son. She’s also opened up about her health after being diagnosed with Grave’s disease.

However, putting Williams’ personal life aside, she’ll need to weigh in on all of the drama that’s been going on in Hollywood since she’s been gone, and fans are hoping for a ton of hot topics next week as Wendy gets back into the swing of things on her show.

The outlet reveals that Williams will likely need to touch on topics such as Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s breakup. The two split after it was revealed the basketball player had cheated on his baby mama with her sister Kylie Jenner’s best friend, Jordyn Woods.

In addition, Kylie has also allegedly accused her own boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott, of cheating on her as well, and the couple is in the middle of their own relationship drama at this time.

Meanwhile, Cardi B and Offset have gotten back together, and fans know that Wendy Williams is going to have an opinion on that celebrity couple as well.

Williams could also touch on the Oscars, and of course, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s intense chemistry on stage as they belted out “Shallow” from the movie A Star Is Born.

Wendy watchers will likely want her take on R. Kelly’s arrest as well. The rapper’s legal drama is heating up after years of sexual abuse allegations.

Another arrest Williams’ will probably touch on is Jussie Smollett. The Empire star was arrested and accused of staging a hate crime against himself, and the details have been shocking fans for weeks.

Other big topics could include Miranda Lambert’s secret marriage, Brad Pitt attending Jennifer Aniston’s birthday party, and Chris Pratt’s engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger, among other things.

Wendy Williams will officially return to her show on Monday, March 4, and fans will be tuning in to hear everything she has to say about her own life, as well as the latest celebrity news."

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share

The brothers allegedly paid to stage an attack on Jussie Smollett have issued a public apology. Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo and Olabinjo 'Ola Osundairo have spoken of their ""tremendous regret"" at being involved in the scandal and said sorry for the negative impact they may have had on other people, particularly those who were victims of hate crimes. A statement issued by their attorney to CBS Chicago read: ""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves."" The 'Empire' actor told police in January he had been attacked by two masked men in Chicago, who had abused him with racist and homophobic language, doused him with a chemical substance and tied a rope around his neck. The two brothers - who knew Jussie from working on 'Empire' and attending the same gym - were arrested last month but were released after telling police about the alleged hoax.

Authorities believe the 36-year-old actor paid the men to stage the attack to draw attention to himself in a bid to get a salary increase, but he has denied the claims.

Jussie was arrested last month on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct and ordered to pay a $10,000 bond and surrender his passport.

His character, Jamal Lyon, was subsequently dropped from the final two episodes of the current season of ''Empire' in order to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show.

The actor has been praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

It is currently not clear if the Osundairo brothers will face any charges."

Smollet is seen with a cut cheek on Jan. 29

Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while walking home from getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2am.

The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an 'unknown substance' on him.

Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in 'MAGA country,' an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan, which some critics of Trump have claimed is a racist dog whistle.

January 30

Chicago police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack.

Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question.

Reports of Smollett's attack draw outrage and support on social media, including from U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren.

Both Booker and Harris called the incident a 'modern day lynching'.

Joe Biden said: 'We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.'

Police released this image of 'persons of interest' taken near the reported attack

January 31

Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett and that, 'It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.'

Smollett's family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime.

Smollett's family says he 'has told the police everything' and 'his story has never changed,' disputing assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

February 1

Smollett issues a statement telling people that he is OK and thanking them for their support.

He says he is working with authorities and has been '100 percent factual and consistent on every level.'

February 2

Smollett gives sold-out concert in West Hollywood, California, opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

At the end of the set, he announces that he fought back against his attackers, calling himself 'the gay Tupac'.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters is in attendance at the concert.

February 5th: Chicago PD releases incident report which reveals Smollett did not want to call police. There is no mention of the MAGA country remark which he gave in a follow-up interview

Brandon Z. Moore, his manager, gives police a screenshot to prove their call.

February 11th: Smollett finally hands over redacted phone records to prove the phone call but police label them 'insufficient'.

His neighbors say they don't believe his version of events.

February 12th: Smollett's rep releases statement to say he is the victim and that he has been telling the truth

February 14th: Good Morning America airs the full interview with Smollett, in which he blasts speculation that the attack was staged as itself racist and hateful.

Hours later, it emerges that two Nigerian brothers were picked up at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria the night before.

Cops identify the two men as the individuals seen in the surveillance images released from the night of January 29 but will not share their names.

Two television stations in Chicago simul report the widespread belief among investigators that Smollett staged the attack as a hate hoax.

Chicago's police superintendent later said that he had no evidence to prove that the attack was a hoax.

Producers of 'Empire' dispute media reports that Smollett's character was being written off the show.

High-powered criminal defense attorney Michael Monico reveals that he is representing Smollett.

Brothers Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo, 25, were detained by police on February 13

February 15

DailyMail.com confirms they are brothers Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo, 25.

Later, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two 'persons of interest' are now considered suspects. He says the men are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

Chicago police release two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours.

A police spokesman said the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have 'new evidence' to consider as a result of questioning them.

February 16

A police spokesman said that the investigation had 'shifted' after detectives questioned the two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, Michael Monico, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers said on Saturday the actor felt 'victimized by reports he played a role in the assault, and that Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

February 17

A police spokesman said that Chicago police have told Smollett’s attorneys they want to do a follow-up interview with the actor.

A spokesperson for Smollett’s lawyers said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident. No photographs of it emerged until after the alleged attack. He reported the letter to the police when he received it along with Empire producer Dennis Hammer

He is named as a suspect later in the afternoon and the brothers are seen entering grand jury offices at the courthouse.

Smollett is criminally charged with filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony which carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.

February 21

Smollett hands himself in to police at 5am. He is later charged with filing a false police report and posts $10,000 - ten percent of his $100,000 bond - and is released from jail.

The actor then releases a statement through his attorneys insisting he is innocent and claiming the prosecutors' office 'trampled' on his presumption of innocence."

It has come to my attention that my book sales — robust though they be — will simply not guarantee a comfortable retirement and I need to expand my product line.

What could be more timely or fill a better market niche in the current Hair Permanently On Fire Oppression Olympics than a Jussie Smollett Commemorative All-Purpose Do It Yourself Hate Crime Kit?

For the bargain-basement price of just $3500, you get:

Two sturdy Nigerians capable of delivering a carefully-calibrated beating

A rubber banana peel

One water-proof fake poop swastika with suction cup suitable for a dorm shower

Several lengths of rope, already fastened in nooses (for Scouts who were not in Scouting

back when you could earn a badge in knot-tying instead of Cooking with Tofu.)

A gallon of bleach which can also be used for laundry – WHITES ONLY (can I say that?)

A dozen MAGA caps

One terrifying mask of a Catholic teenage white boy smiling

Fake dog poop in a tube of soothing crème suitable for self-smearing

One set of Sharpies in several colors and list of various offensive words – hurry!

Unacceptable Words can change daily. Remember “macaca”!?

It actually influenced an election!

One traceable swastika stencil so you don’t make it backwards like so many bigots

with Carter era speed-limit IQs.

A handy Velcro tear-away detachable hijab for easy removal

And a frozen Whole Foods cake with “Fag” pre-written on it so YOU, the gay Hate Crime

Faker, don’t have to waste valuable time or frosting writing that on your own.

But wait, there’s more! Because how can you fake a Hate Crime if you aren’t even a member of a protected group that it’s forbidden to hate? So act before midnight also to get:

A lovely set of High Cheekbone Implants

The Ward Churchill Detachable Braid with Eagle Feather Made in China

The Rachel Dolezal black fright wig

Nobody cares if white men or Conservative White Women (icky poo), Conservative Black People (even worse!) or (Gag) CHRISTIANS or weather-wizardy JOOZ are hated. They are attacked daily in the media and sometimes in person, though that carries risks. Remember: whatever happens to them, they have it coming. Because Trump. A woman lawyer (a LAWYER!) cheered the horrendous Las Vegas mass murder because the victims were country western fans and “most of them like guns and are Republican.” Well, okay then.

And, FINALLY, as a SUPER SPECIAL BONUS, we will include a pair of Jimmy Choo Size 14EEE high heels in ecru – they go with everything! This last item is not to stage a Hate Crime per se. No, it is to PREVENT one.

We purveyors of the Hate Crime Kit feel that if an enormous, unhinged, ugly, obviously male customer in an auto parts store is wearing high heels, it could lower the risk that he will be “gender misidentified” and called “Sir,” thus causing a meltdown and kick-a-thon that would make a two-year-old jealous. In truth, he was neither a “Sir” nor a “Ma’am,” which implies some sort of manners and self-respect, but a dangerous deranged thug.

Just a small point on this subject: as an enthusiastically-heterosexual female with a somewhat-deeper voice than many females, I have FREQUENTLY been called “Sir” on the telephone. Especially when I have had a chest cold. Even when I am making airline or hotel reservations for a person named “Susan”. Which always makes me laugh, rather than kick over displays. Because I am not insane.

I have always figured that the poor front-line person is forced to choose between “Sir” and “Ma’am” and would prefer mistakenly to call a woman “Sir” than to call a man “Ma’am.” I have recovered from each separate unforgivable outrage within several seconds, correcting the person as gently as possible to avoid his embarrassment. If it weren’t necessary to make an accurate reservation, I wouldn’t even bother to correct him.

So thank you for ordering my DIY Hate Crime Kit! Good luck with planning your own Hate Crime. Poor Jussie thought he had the “perfect” Hate Crime, which had even been rehearsed! Plus he had hundreds of willing media stooges and Tweeting celebrity accomplices – Cher, Cory, Kamala, Maxine, Jim Carrey – to the extent that a not-very-paranoid person could ALMOST think it was COORDINATED to coincide with the stupid “anti-lynching” legislation. Because, as you know, murder is, like, totally NOT currently illegal. Yeah, I know – crazy, right?

And despite every advantage, look what happened to Jussie. (Well, nothing so far…but you never know.) His story stunk to high heavens from day one. But he and his platoon of lawyers are stickin’ to that story like Titanic survivors to a piece of driftwood. Maybe he’s going for an Insanity Plea. So how can YOU improve?

Remember to go where there are no cameras, no busybodies videotaping everything on their cellphones, no eyewitnesses. Try not to stage it in a part of town that elderly Tea Party/MAGA people would never be visiting in broad daylight, let alone at night. Do NOT pretend they said “This is MAGA country” in either Portland, Berkeley, the South Side of Chicago, or the Upper West Side of New York. Now it’s true that “Can you please direct me to the Holland Tunnel?” does not sound as threatening as “This is MAGA Country,” but trust me, no Trump supporter ever said that to a random gay black person. Or any black person. Or anyone else. Ever.

Arrange to have yourself more severely injured than a little teeny cut below the eye on your pretty face. In fact, I recommend you sustain a small-caliber gunshot wound where it will not hit a vital organ, such as to the head. That lends some verisimilitude to the hate crime charge, believe me. There will be flowers and candles on the spot of the assault and Elton John will write a song for you. Go big or go home."

The two brothers involved in what police say was a staged hate crime against actor Jussie Smollett have issued a public apology through their lawyer.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in a statement to CBS Chicago.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were initially arrested as suspected attackers after the “Empire” star, who is gay, reported that he was pummeled by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, and “This is MAGA country!” — and then doused him with bleach and left a noose around his neck.

But cops now allege Smollett paid the pair $3,500 to stage the beatdown outside his apartment building last month.

Investigators believe he staged the attack “because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said, citing information the brothers gave authorities.

Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct and is barred from leaving the state without permission from a judge. His next court date is March 14.

The brothers were released without charges after being arrested last month."

In cowardly fashion, Biden — who’s a top contender to be the Democrats’ 2020 Trump-challenger, though he’s yet to officially throw his hat in the ring — walked back the utterly mild compliment.

“The fact of the matter is it was followed on by a guy who’s a decent guy, our vice president, who stood before this group of allies and leaders and said, ‘I’m here on behalf of President Trump,’ and there was dead silence. Dead silence,” Biden told an audience at the Chuck Hagel Forum in Global Leadership at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, according to CNN.

In Omaha, Joe Biden calls Mike Pence “a decent guy, our vice president.” — Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) February 28, 2019

“Sex and the City” actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon was one of the high-profile leftists who lashed out at Biden for the remark.

“[Joe Biden] you’ve just called America’s most anti-LGBT elected leader ‘a decent guy,'” she posted in a tweet. “Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community.”

.@JoeBiden you’ve just called America’s most anti-LGBT elected leader “a decent guy.” Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community. @DrBiden https://t.co/Cw2beknTj7 — Cynthia Nixon (@CynthiaNixon) February 28, 2019

Biden quickly walked back the remark in a reply to Nixon.

“You’re right, Cynthia,” he wrote. “I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage. But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.”

But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 28, 2019

Nixon offered a conditioned thanks to Biden for his retraction and added another jab at Mr. Pence: “Thanks [Joe Biden]. Appreciate the response,” she said. “But please understand from where we sit, his dehumanizing of our community disqualifies [Mike Pence] for the honorific of ‘decent’, regardless of the context.”

Thanks @JoeBiden. Appreciate the response. But please understand from where we sit, his dehumanizing of our community disqualifies @MikePence for the honorific of ‘decent’, regardless of the context. — Cynthia Nixon (@CynthiaNixon) March 1, 2019

The demonization of Pence by the Left has heightened over the course of his vice presidency. In January, left-wing politicos attempted to paint Pence as a “homophobe,” mocking the vice president for allegedly looking “uncomfortable” while swearing in openly bisexual Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D- AZ) on a law book, as opposed to the Bible. However, this was nothing more than a smear of Pence for daring to be open about his Christian faith. Video footage revealed that there was no evidence of discomfort from Pence; on the contrary, the vice president welcomed Sinema when she walked up to be sworn in, offering the senator congratulations and telling her it was his “great honor.”

More recently, actress Ellen Page targeted Pence after “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett claimed he was the victim of a hate crime perpetrated by two white supporters of President Donald Trump for being black and gay. Page blamed Pence for the attack during an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” a mere two days after the attack, which has since been called a hoax by Chicago Police Department officials.

“We have a media that’s saying it’s a debate whether or not what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. It isn’t a debate,” Page told Colbert, adding: “It feels impossible to not feel this way now with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn’t be married. Let’s be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife. … He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana, and I think the thing we need to know and I hope my show Gaycation did this in terms of connecting the dots in terms of what happened the other day to Jussie, I don’t know him personally, I send all of my love.”

Page has yet to apologize to Mr. Pence."

In late January, Chicago was in the grip of a weather phenomenon known as a polar vortex. It is part of the emergency of global warming and, without being too technical, it is unusual and devastating.

Chicagoans are used to very cold winters with the wind chill factor well below zero, but this attack of weather caught everyone by surprise. Hot water thrown into the air froze instantly, creating a glistening sky; a good samaritan used her credit card to pay for hotel rooms for dozens of homeless people she did not know. It was that kind of cold.

The wind coming off Lake Michigan, and also the Chicago River, close by at points, can be refreshing in the summer but literally a killer in the dead of winter.

Chicago is also one of the most camera-surveyed cities in the world. There are cameras everywhere. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don’t. But you can see them and often they help. Young black men in Chicago are under particular scrutiny for various reasons. They know it, too.

The posh downtown area of the city is especially protected by all sorts of overt and covert means. For African American men accused of anything there, an encounter with law enforcement and security guards can be more punitive, even fatal.

Add into this mix the fact that Chicago is what its outgoing mayor, Rahm Emanuel calls a “Trump-free zone”. Trump hates Chicago and the compliment is returned.

Enter this mise-en-scène the African American actor and singer, Jussie Smollett, born and raised in Los Angeles and star of a hit television series Empire.

Empire, a clever musical take on King Lear set in the world of the hip hop industry, featuring a mogul, his sons and scheming wife, has broken new ground. Not only does it show a wealthy African American with all the problems that big money brings, there is also an LGBT character, an openly gay son played by Smollett, who himself is out.

His character carries the heart of the show and has endeared him, especially, to black men grappling with their own sexuality within a community not always welcoming to it. Empire is filmed in Chicago and the city has taken the cast and crew to its heart. And so the news that Smollett had been assaulted in Chicago, in the downtown area, on January 29 caused outrage and immediate condemnation.

In his account, a rope was put around his neck and a chemical substance was poured over him by two men wearing ski masks and MAGA – ‘Make America Great Again – hats, who shouted “this is Maga country”.

We are in a time – and rightly so – when we believe people who say that they have been victims of assault of any kind. We have to, because so many people have lived their pain, their lives unbelieved. In the case of gay men, who are victims of assault more than we know, this becomes crucial.

The Chicago Police Department – responsible for policing a city with many unsolved murders, some from many years ago – pulled out all of the stops. They immediately set out to find the perpetrators. The entire city did likewise.

Smollett took to the airwaves, taking interview after interview. Presidential candidates jumped to defend him. But those people who know Chicago, and the area where the attack was alleged to have happened, began to be sceptical. And scepticism in a matter like this is not allowed. Yet it never went away, because the very narrative that Smollett himself put out there engendered it.

Last week, the CPD declared Smollett a suspect in a hoax of his own devising. The CPD claim that he hired two men, one his personal trainer, to stage an assault on one of those posh, downtown streets in the early morning of that polar vortex. He paid them, the police allege, to shout “This is Trump country” and to put a noose around his neck. He also, the cops say, wrote the racist note that he said was sent to him at the Empire studios. Smollett has declared himself not guilty and, after a court hearing, his lawyers dismissed the case against him as “an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system”.

Chicago is one of the cities of the Great Migration, that movement of black people out of the rural South, of murder, deprivation and poverty, to the North, where it was hoped life worked better. All of us born and raised in Chicago have or had families from Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. The Deep South. The Old Confederacy.

As the police chief, himself a black man and a descendant of the Great Migration, read the charges against Smollett, his voice quivered when he came to what he called “the noose”. Lynching was, and still is, the crime of choice used by white supremacists against particularly black men.

In many shop and country stores in the South, and sometimes in the North, you could buy atrocity postcards, images of black men hanging from trees, often surrounded by the smiling God-fearin’ locals... with their children.

Smollett protests his innocence, and he is innocent, until found guilty by a jury of his peers in a court of law. That is how we work. But the court of public opinion has already condemned him.

My first reaction after the police charges were made was to worry that his friends may not realise that a man who is alleged to have perpetrated a hoax of this magnitude might be a suicide risk. Maybe, no matter what, his friends should gather around him, make sure that he does not harm himself, because no good purpose could come out of that. Maybe shield him as the LGBT community condemns him for putting its members at risk of not being believed because of his alleged shenanigans.

The police believe he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary”, prompting the mayor to tell him to get a better agent, if that was his motive. And the mayor should know about these things – the hectic Hollywood life of one of his own brothers has formed an element of another hit television show, Entourage.

If Smollett is found guilty of what he is accused of doing I think that we are beginning to see the exhibition of what may be a disease in our digital age: narcissism.

Social media gives us all a voice. All of us. In the immortal line written by the director Joseph Mankiewicz for his film All About Eve, and brilliantly delivered by Marilyn Monroe as an explanation as to why her character referred to a butler as ‘waiter’, she replies: “Someone’s name could be ‘butler’.”

This is an example of thought as being brilliant sui generis: of itself. Because all thought is of equal importance and intelligence in the social media world . Right up there with Voltaire.

So there has to be, for a celebrity, another level of visibility. The archetype. Liam Neeson – with his recent tale of rage – may have chosen one: The martyr, the man who exposes his own sin – real or imagined – in order to save us.

And Smollett may have chosen, since he is a member of not one, but two oppressed minorities: The messiah, who dies and rises again.

We may find that the motive for the alleged behaviour of Jussie Smollett, if he is found to be guilty, was that he simply wanted us to notice him more. In this Age Of Narcissism."

(Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty)

The brothers who Jussie Smollett allegedly paid to stage an attack on him have expressed their “tremendous regret” over the incident.

Abel and Ola Osundairo, who were arrested by the police last month and questioned as suspects before being released and reportedly treated as witnesses, gave a statement through their attorney to entertainment publication TheWrap on Thursday night (February 28).

Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, said: “My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.”

Smollett was arrested by Chicago police and charged with filing a false police report last month after alleging that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January.

Jussie Smollett suspended from Empire after arrest

Smollett was suspended from Fox show Empire following his arrest on February 21.

In a statement reported by Entertainment Weekly on February 22, Empire‘s executive producers said that “to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

They called the charges against Smollett “very disturbing.”

Smollett faces up to three years in prison and $25,000 in fines if found guilty of arranging what Police Chief Eddie T. Johnson called a “hoax” in a press briefing on February 21.

“Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.” — Police Chief Eddie T. Johnson

Johnson said: “This announcement today recognises that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

The police chief, who is African-American himself, called Smollett’s behaviour “shameful,” adding: “I’m left hanging my head and asking, why?”

He said the Empire actor first attempted to drum up attention from the public by sending a fake racist letter to his place of work.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that the FBI was investigating hate mail sent to Smollett in the days leading up to his alleged attack.

Johnson said that “when that didn’t work, he paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud in the process.”

Jussie Smollett maintains innocence after arrest

In a statement released on February 21 after his arrest, Smollett said he felt “betrayed” by authorities.

“Mr Smollet [sic] is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” read a statement sent on behalf of Smollett to Deadline.

“Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” the statement added.

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.”"

“They understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

Smollett reported in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

But now police allege that Smollett hired the Osundairo brothers and paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Smollett faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct for falsely claiming he was attacked, police said.

Disorderly conduct is generally not charged as a felony, Chicago defense attorney Steven Hunter told CNN in an email. But the national and international attention on the case likely made the charge more significant for the defendant, he said. And that could impact any future punishment if he is convicted, he said.

“In my experience, the more publicity a case has, the worse it is for the defendant,” Hunter said.

Investigators believe Smollett staged the attack “because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said, citing information that the brothers gave to police.

The actor took “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said.

Smollett has maintained that he did not make the story up. A source told CNN that he reiterated to the “Empire” cast and crew he was innocent of the charge against him.

Smollett is now out on a $10,000 bond and is due back in court March 14.

The brothers are cooperating fully with their investigation and are no longer suspects, Chicago police said. They were released without charges after being arrested last month."

Thus, the headline at People.com, that declares “Drake’s Dad Says He Supports R. Kelly “100 Percent” and Claims Jussie Smollet Is “Misunderstood” certainly receives attention.

There is always the possibility that people weigh in on issues for the pure publicity that unpopular opinions bring. But there is something about Drake’s dad, Dennis Graham, that makes his statements seem believable, if unsettling to some.

Dennis Graham and the defense of R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett

On People.com, Graham praised Kelly as “a good friend of mine.” He also states that “I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.”

Victims’ advocates would probably note that Graham’s comments are exactly why victims do not come forward. Further, as anyone who has been paying attention knows, the bulk of the accusers were minors at the time. Minors who had probably been manipulated and threatened. Also, after what fact? From all accounts, these were not consensual relationships, and minors cannot consent, anyway.

The support of Kelly from anyone seems to arrive with the idea that these girls of color could not be innocent. It is one that was brought up toward the end of the documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly.” The concept is as troubling now as it was during the airing of the series.

Graham does indicate that he and Kelly are friends.

Graham has a new single, “That on That” and is apparently making the rounds to promote it.

As for Smollett, Graham said “That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago, is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine also. They have totally reconstructed his story,” according to People.com.

Despite Graham’s support, Smollett was arrested last week and is likely going to be charged with disorderly conduct, which is a felony. Smollett had a starring role on the hit show, “Empire.” In various news outlets, it has been alleged that Smollett’s role has been decreased after his legal issues mounted. The actor claimed to have been attacked by two men in a racially motivated incident. Later, the two men that were supposed to have attacked Smollett admitted to being paid by the actor and had been filmed in a store buying the supplies for the attack.

Smollett maintains his innocence.

Both the cases of Kelly and Smollett create problems for audiences who would prefer to engage in the performers’ work without having to sort out ethical issues about them.

Despite the widespread coverage of both Kelly’s and Smollett’s cases, the inclusion of Graham in the arguments about the two is surprising and indicative of the complexity of ideas surrounding both men. Regardless of how information is presented, it will be difficult to prove to some people how damaging it can be to ignore facts."

The slap-in-the-face Robert Kraft solicitation story is three days old, and if police in south Florida prove their case against the Patriots owner, I believe he’ll be suspended by commissioner Roger Goodell. Without any new weekend news on the case, I’ll lead this week with the official start of draft season.

The first round of the 2019 NFL Draft kicks off in Nashville two months from tonight. The first day of the week-long NFL Scouting Combine is Tuesday in Indianapolis. So it’s a good time for college-football know-nothings like me to start the learning process on the new names that will be household names in the pro football world by late April.

This is not setting up to be a dramatic draft year, or in the run-up to the draft, except for one thing: where Kyler Murray goes. The undersized (5-9 7/8, Oklahoma says) quarterback set college football on fire last fall and could go anywhere from the first overall pick (Arizona) to fourth (Oakland) to seventh (Jacksonville) to 13th (Miami) to 15th (Washington), or to a slot somewhere else after a trade. I covered Murray in depth last week and will spend most of my time here on the other 330 or so players in Indianapolis this week.

One bit of Murray news before we move on. The new Mike Mayock at NFL Network, Daniel Jeremiah—talk about big shoes to fill—told me over the weekend that he heard Murray has bulked up to 203 pounds from his OU playing weight of 190. And calling around over the weekend, I heard it was 206. That is significant. Here’s why: Talking to NFL people about Murray, as I wrote last week, there was worry that Murray had more of a Mookie Betts build in college than a Russell Wilson physique. Meaning Murray was not only small, but also slight. If Murray has spent the past five or six weeks bulking up, that would play in his favor at the combine and in completing scouting reports on a complex prospect, because teams want to see a thicker player than Murray was at OU. Theoretically, it would mean he’d be more equipped to withstand the pounding he’ll obviously have to face in the NFL.

I spoke to two long-time NFL personnel men and three media folk—Jeremiah, Mel Kiper of ESPN and Matt Miller, a rising authority with Bleacher Report—for draft info in advance of combine week. For more, please listen to The Peter King Podcast, with Jeremiah and Miller, dropping Wednesday.

One note before we start: It was cool to hear Jeremiah pay homage to the new general manager of the Oakland Raiders, Mayock—something he wanted to do before we started discussing draft nuts and bolts. You’ll enjoy that on the podcast. “He was a good teammate,” said Jeremiah, “and as good of a dude as everyone at home thinks he is.”

The Lead: Combine

Now for a few takes on the 2019 crop of collegians:

The Best Player in the Draft

• Nick Bosa. Nick Bosa. Nick Bosa. “Injured his senior year in high school [torn ACL], injured this year [core muscle surgery], but he’s my highest-rated player,’’ Kiper said of the Ohio State defensive end. “Great bend, great motor.”

• Said Jeremiah: “When I watch Nick, I see the exact same moves as his brother [Chargers pass-rusher Joey Bosa].”

• Pluses: 17.5 sacks in 29 college games, great instinct. The minus: season-ending injuries in two of his past four football seasons.

The Quality

• “Really strong defensive draft,” Kiper said. “Deep at defensive line. Deep through three rounds. Good running back and receiver depth in rounds two through five.”

• Jeremiah: “If you’re in the hunt for difference-makers on the defensive line, and overall depth on the offensive line … you’re going to feel great about this draft. Offensive line-wise, there’s no Joe Thomas, no Jonathan Ogden, but there’s depth.”

• For Jeremiah, 10 of his top 19 prospects in this draft are front-seven defensive players, including his top four: Bosa, Alabama defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, Kentucky pass rusher Josh Allen and Clemson defensive tackle Christian Wilkins.

The Passers

Not the quality of 2018, when quarterbacks went 1-3-7-10-32 in round one. On his big board, Jeremiah has Kyler Murray 14th, Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins 18th, Missouri’s Drew Lock 26th and Duke’s Daniel Jones 32nd. Those are ratings, not a projection of where Jeremiah thinks they’ll go.

• I’m hearing Haskins and Murray, in some order, are solid top 10 picks. “Haskins is a pure pocket passer,” Jeremiah said. “If he were to have come out 10 years ago, we’d be talking about him as a surefire top five pick … He just doesn’t move around very well. When he has to move off his spot he really struggles.”

• Jeremiah loves Lock’s arm but not his overall mechanics. “His feet are kind of all over the place,” he said.

• On Jones, Jeremiah thinks his grade will be mixed on different draft boards, with team that want a power arm downgrading him.

The Injury Mysteries

• Oklahoma receiver Marquise Brown (Lisfranc foot surgery) won’t run full-speed till August, but he might have been the fastest guy at the combine had he been fit enough to run. “I remember scouting DeSean Jackson at Cal, and this is a clone,” Jeremiah said. Brown will be a late-first-round gift to some team.

• Mississippi State defensive Jeffery Simmons likely would have been a top 10 pick before tearing his ACL recently; how far he slides will be a big pre-draft story.

• Kiper loves Bryce Love, the Stanford running back recovering from December ACL surgery; Love could be a fourth-round bargain in a draft full of middle-round backs.

The Meat of the Draft

Rounds two and three. It’s a good year to have six picks between 32 and 101, which is where the rich-get-richer Patriots find themselves. Said Jeremiah: “You look at the Baltimore Ravens picking at 22. They have no second-round pick. To me, if the Ravens pick at 22 I will buy you dinner the next time we’re together. I know the new GM, Eric DeCosta, taking over there from Ozzie Newsome, is a very bright guy. The value in this draft is in that second-round range. I would be surprised a team like Baltimore doesn’t take pick 22 and look to get out of there and see if they can flex some more picks there in that second-round range.”

The Skill Players

• General consensus: One back (Josh Jacobs of Alabama) in the top 20. There’s a feel that, in a league when 2016 Offensive Rookie of the Year Alvin Kamara was the 67th pick in a draft and 2016 NFL rushing champion Kareem Hunt was the 86th that you’re fine getting a good back—like Florida Atlantic’s Devin Singletary or Iowa State’s David Montgomery or Penn State’s Miles Sanders—somewhere between picks 40 and 100. “Running back value is in the second to the fifth round,” Kiper said.

• As for wideouts, it’s another deep year in the second and third rounds. Oklahoma’s Brown and Mississippi’s D.K. Metcalf lead the way on Jeremiah’s board.

• Interesting that Jeremiah has three tight ends among his top 25 players: Iowa’s T.J. Hockenson (5), Iowa’s Noah Fant (23) and Alabama Irv Smith Jr. (25). Yes, that’s two tight ends from Iowa in the first-round conversation. Fant will likely be the fastest tight end at the combine; he has run 4.64, And Hockenson is athletic with a Mark Bavaro-blocking streak. Add to that the fact that NFL teams love players from Iowa because they value coach Kirk Ferentz NFL-preparedness training. No school has ever produced two first-round tight ends in the same year.

Cautionary Tale

There won’t be many players who make or break anything in the next week, so throw anything you hear like that out of your mental window. I’ll tell you why. Last year, Oklahoma tackle Orlando Brown was Mayock’s number-two-rated tackle in the draft entering the combine, and he had a disastrous performance. He ran an Eisen-like 5.85 40-yard dash, and did a feeble 14 reps of the 225-pound bench press. Brown was ridiculed. The Ravens picked him in the third round. He played 15 games at tackle for Baltimore. Pro Football Focus had a higher 2018 grade for Brown than for the following zillionaire tackles: Trent Williams, Taylor Lewan, Jack Conklin, Nate Solder, Taylor Decker, Jason Peters and Cordy Glenn. So chill on conclusions drawn this week.

NFL Network’s complete coverage at the combine kicks off Monday, and position group coverage begins Friday. ESPN will have a live show from 1-3 p.m. featuring Kiper and other network analysts Saturday on ABC during the quarterback drills.

On Robert Kraft 10

Friday evening, an estimated 8.15 million American TV viewers heard anchor Lester Holt lead the NBC Nightly News this way: “Breaking news tonight … Shock waves as the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, is charged in a day-spa prostitution sting.”

On Saturday morning, the 4 million subscribers (newspaper and web) to the New York Times read this headline above the fold on the front page: “Patriots Owner Facing Charges After Sex Sting.” That’s commissioner Roger Goodell’s morning paper. Inside, in the lead story of the Times sports section, respected NFL correspondent Ken Belson wrote: “However the case is resolved, the episode is an embarrassment to a league that likes to portray itself as a pillar of moral rectitude but has struggled to shake an image that its players, employees and team owners treat women poorly.”

“KRAFT FACES CHARGES OF SOLICITATION,” blared the front page of Kraft’s hometown Boston Globe, which landed on newsstands all over his beloved six-state New England region.

The NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy mandates that owners and club officials “will be subject to more significant discipline” for violations of the policy and reads: “Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the NFL.”

Prostitution. Sex trafficking. Video evidence of Kraft’s involvement, according to police. The most negative of headlines and news coverage, focused on one of the most important owners in recent league history, on the steward of the franchise that has won more Super Bowls in one era (six) than any franchise in league history … and leading the news on a day with Washington imploding. Add to that the specter of the NFL’s incessant recruitment of women as fans and consumers and fantasy football players, and add to that the feeling by many in the outer boroughs of the league that Kraft is especially close to the league office. It just ratchets up the pressure on Goodell’s prospective judgment in the case. In Goodell’s 12-and-a-half years as commissioner, he hasn’t faced a situation like this one. Which makes it difficult to forecast what Goodell will do to Kraft, if the charges are true.

But there are clues.

Everything about the charge of Kraft on two occasions soliciting a prostitute—one used against her will in a case of human trafficking—has to be prefaced with “if.” The cases arising from a strip-mall spa in Jupiter, Fla., against a cadre of accused men have not been publicly proven, and we’re reminded by the Jussie Smollett case to let the facts surface before passing judgment. Police in Jupiter, Fla., have alleged Kraft twice frequented a spa accused of prostitution, and the police say they have incriminating video of Kraft. A spokesman for Kraft “categorically” denied involvement “in any illegal activity.” The league said it was aware of the case and was monitoring developments, the NFL’s euphemism for, “We’re buying time.” So that’s where it stands this morning.

But if the charges against Kraft prove to be true, I believe the Ray Rice precedent will come into play. And that would not be good news for Kraft. I believe if Kraft is found guilty, commissioner Roger Goodell couldn’t give Kraft a hefty fine alone. The problem with a fine of Kraft? The last sitting owner to be seriously sanctioned by Goodell, Indianapolis’ Jim Irsay, was suspended for six games and fined $500,000 for driving while impaired. That sort of fine, on its own, would be the ultimate slap on the wrist to a man Forbes says is worth $6.8 billion. To be exact, $500,000 would be one-fourteenth of 1 percent of Kraft’s worth. Next to nothing, really. That’s part of the reason why I believe Kraft, if he is guilty, is more likely than not to be suspended.

Think back to the Rice case in 2014. Rice, a Ravens running back, had an altercation with his fiancé at an Atlantic City hotel, and Goodell suspended Rice for two games. The light punishment was derided by the public—particularly women’s groups—and Goodell looked feckless when video of the altercation surfaced and showed Rice decking his fiancé with a single punch. The league revised its punishment, suspending Rice indefinitely, but by then it was too late. Goodell was ripped nationally for running an initially shoddy investigation of the case and for being soft on domestic violence.

So now, if Kraft is found to have used prostitutes being employed against their will in a human-trafficking scheme, the commissioner will have two choices:

• Go light on Kraft if there’s no proof he knew the woman or women were employed against their will. That seems unlikely. When the NFL suspends players for using PEDs, even if the supplement was bought over the counter at a reputable vitamin store, players can’t use the excuse that they didn’t know a substance banned by the NFL was part of the supplement. Similarly, I doubt Goodell would accept a defense of “I didn’t know the women were part of a trafficking scheme.” Someone already involved in an illegal activity would not garner empathy for pleading ignorance there.

• Give Kraft a significant sanction—a multi-week (or longer) suspension from all Patriots and league activities, and a fine. This would show the league taking a stand against the burgeoning American issue of human-trafficking (it is already the cause of two highly respected NFL coaches, Mike Tomlin and Frank Reich), as well as showing the public it won’t kid-glove a high-profile owner.

I think it would be the latter. Again, the case is still unproven, and it’s highly likely Goodell will wait to see the corroborating evidence.

But if found culpable, Kraft might be wise to suggest a third option. He has been generous to important causes, small and large. In addition to a multi-week suspension, he could agree to lead an NFL initiative to help fight human trafficking, and provide significant seed money for the project. That might be one way to limit the amount of long-term personal damage. Deadspin reported that Kraft already has supported the fight against human trafficking with a $100,000 donation in 2015 to the Boston-based “My Life My Choice,” which supports human-trafficking victims. This is a desperately needed cause in the United States and the world, and Kraft’s renewed backing of the fight could be crucial in the fight.

Some would suggest Kraft deserves to have his ownership of the team stripped. I don’t see that happening. When Carolina owner Jerry Richardson was accused by former staff members of sexual and personal improprieties late in 2017 by Sports Illustrated, Richardson stepped away from the team and sold the franchise six weeks before the NFL fined him for his actions. Harboring a culture of intimidation inside his organization, and pressuring multiple female employees for sexual-related favors over a period of years, as Richardson did, could have led to him being stripped of his team. But Goodell never had to rule on that because Richardson voluntarily stepped away.

What would wound Kraft deeply, if found guilty, is knowing that damage he’d have done to his name and his brand—and it would be the third strike against his dynasty. The Spygate scandal tarnished Bill Belichick in 2007 (costing him $500,000 and the team a first-round draft choice), and the Deflategate scandal in 2015 got Tom Brady suspended for four games and cost the team another first-round pick. Because this violation has nothing to do with the competitive aspects of football, it wouldn’t be subject to draft-pick penalty. Goodell would hand down a penalty he feels is just. But Kraft being found guilty would be the third strike against the best long-term team in modern football history, even though it would have nothing to do with football.

One last point: If Goodell has to rule on Kraft, it will be watched as closely as any recent ruling he’s made—by the football community and by women in many communities monitoring a business that has talked a good game about women but has not always walked the walk. It’d be naïve to think Goodell’s clumsy handling of Rice would not be brought up to him by a largely new staff of PR operatives inside the NFL. That matters.

For now, the legal process will play out, in Jupiter, Fla., and in New England and inside the NFL offices in New York, and the consequences to a surprising story will be mulled. “We’re as equally stunned as anyone else,” Jupiter police chief Daniel Kerr said Friday. He’s not alone.

Good Story. Good Cause

I’ve made it a habit at the combine in Indianapolis to have an event to meet and greet people who love football or follow me on Twitter (or both), and hopefully to raise a few bucks for a good local cause, by listening to me and some of my national sportswriter friends talk football for a couple of hours. This year, I enlisted Colts coach Frank Reich to appear, so we could raise a little more money for a cause he is passionate about: Ascent 121, which aids victims of human trafficking in Indiana.

Reich’s a wonderful story—the underdog quarterback who won one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history, the 41-38 wild-card win in 1992 … the underdog coordinator who thought he’d never get an head-coaching job but finally did out of nowhere a year ago … and now the underdog head coach who led the Colts to a stunning playoff berth in 2018.

And, he would want you to know, a person who is championing an important cause in our society today—the fight against human trafficking.

You can come and hear the Reich story, in conversation with me, at Sun King Brewery Friday at 5 p.m. in downtown Indianapolis. When Reich has to leave to do Combine business at 6, I’ll host a football chat with some of my friends in the national media. And you’ll get a beer from Sun King, one of America’s great craft breweries.

Buy tickets here. Hope to see you there, to talk football and to support an important cause. If you’ve got any questions, please email me.

Quotes of the Week 20

I

“They can hold out all the hope they want to. I’m going to play football.”

—Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray on Saturday, on the Oakland A’s (the baseball team that spent a first-round pick in the MLB Draft last June on Murray) continuing to hope he will eventually choose to play baseball.

II

“I might take their entire draft from them. It has to be something that cripples the organization. This is a black eye. You talk about conduct detrimental.”

—Bart Scott, former Jets and Ravens linebacker, speaking on his WFAN radio show Friday about the penalty he thinks the league should give the Patriots for owner Robert Kraft being caught in a south Florida prostitution sting.

The NFL has used draft-choice penalties for football violations, not non-football violations.

III

“He has to be suspended for at least a year.”

—Bart Scott, on Kraft.

IV

“You are what your record says you are. I’m not going to sit here and accuse anyone of racism, but the facts are what they are. We have to look at the opportunities that were given to minorities this latest round and see what can be done about it.”

—Steelers president Art Rooney II, to Tim Graham of The Athletic, after the NFL’s minority head-coaches were halved—from eight in 2018 to four in 2019—this offseason.

—Mike Lombardi of The Athletic.

What I Learned

ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper has been covering the draft for 41 years, the last 36 for ESPN. This is something you don’t know: This is the first NFL Scouting Combine he will actually attend. ESPN has been given access to the on-field drills this year for the first time and so Kiper—who has watched the combine on TV for years—will go to Indianapolis and be present to see the underwear Olympics (the snide term by some scouts for the combine). Kiper, on what he’s learned about the important things in the scouting process leading up to the draft:

“I’ve learned it’s all important, to a degree. But there are a few things I pay attention to in every player. Arm length’s important. Getting your hands on guys, catching up when a guy gets past you. Even for corners it’s important. Marlon Humphrey of the Ravens, long arms. T.J. Watt, Myles Garrett, long arms. Jared Allen—long arms were a big part of his game. I like the 3-cone drill, because it measures change of direction, and that’s so important at every position. I like speed, at every position. Terron Armstead was a 4.71 (in the 40-yard dash) guy and went in the third round. Darius Slay ran 4.36 and went in the second. There’s reasons for that, but speed and quickness is valuable at every position.

“I think you’ve got to guard against changing your board a lot now, when the coaches get involved. Not that they don’t know these [prospects], but you’ve got to trust your scouts and the work they’ve done all year going from campus to campus.

“I’ve learned how important the undrafted free agents are every year. Maybe a guy you liked a lot didn’t have a great senior year. Maybe he was hurt, or maybe he played hurt. Lots of guys play hurt in football. Was he playing through a hamstring? An ankle? You’ve got to be able to look at that and see through it. There are a lot of outliers in football, guys who might not fit or check every box. I wish I could just one year get the chance to sign 15 to 20 undrafted free agents after the seventh round, because I know some of those guys would be a lot better than not being drafted.

“I’ve made mistakes analyzing players. I really liked Jimmy Clausen when he came out of Notre Dame, and I was wrong about him. I thought he’d be accurate and tough and competitive and that would make up for some of his arm issues. But in this business you’re going to make mistakes. Part of the job. I remember back in 1996, the Rams had two first-round picks and took Lawrence Phillips and Eddie Kennison with the sixth and 18th picks. I said right then they should have taken Eddie George and Marvin Harrison, and they could have gotten both guys where they picked.”

Numbers Game 30

Michael David Smith wrote about how the NFL should reconsider the system of compensatory draft choices, in part because it encourages smart teams to shed good but often not great players in free agency so they can save cap room and recoup valuable draft picks the following spring. He’s absolutely right. Compensatory picks are awarded to teams a year after losing big-money free-agents.

Let’s look at this year’s top 11 Compensatory Picks, seven in round three, four in round four. That is all of the extra picks awarded in the first 170 picks in the 2019 draft. You’ll see why the Compensatory Pick system might need to be revised.

• Compensatory Picks awarded in round three and four, total: 11.

• Compensatory Picks awarded to 2018 playoffs teams in rounds three and four: 7.

The picks awarded in rounds three and four, followed by the 2018 record of that team, plus the player that team lost to get the pick:

Round 3

Washington (7-9, Kirk Cousins)

New England (14-5, Nate Solder)

Los Angeles Rams (15-4, Trumaine Johnson)

Los Angeles Rams (15-4, Sammy Watkins)

Carolina (7-9, Andrew Norwell)

New England (14-5, Malcolm Butler)

Baltimore (10-7, Ryan Jensen)

Round 4

Indianapolis (11-7, Donte Moncrief)

Dallas (11-7, Anthony Hitchens)

Atlanta (7-9, Taylor Gabriel)

Philadelphia (10-8, Trey Burton)

I mean, look at that list of lost players and tell me that the smart teams don’t use Compensatory Picks as a farm system to replenish their roster and get rid of guys whose new contracts, by and large, don’t come close to matching their mediocre (collectively) 2018 production.

Factoidness

The betting site BetOnline listed these odds for possible length of suspension against New England owner Robert Kraft:

1-4 weeks: 2-1.

5-8 weeks: 5-4.

9-17 weeks: 7-5.

What a country.

To comment on the column, or to say anything about anything, you can reach me by email.

Advice for Kevin Colbert. From Jason K. of Woodland Hills, Calif.: “I understand Pittsburgh not wanting to help their division or help New England by trading them a top five receiver, but is that smart? With the Pats having six picks in the first three rounds, they could blow the doors off Pittsburgh with a big-time offer. I’ll never understand teams limiting their scope for a trade.”

I think you’re misreading New England’s team-building ways. Antonio Brown wants a new contract, with most or all of it guaranteed, and he’s 31 in July, and he’s been an idiot for the last two months, and the Patriots haven’t paid big money to an offensive player other than Tom Brady (well, maybe Rob Gronkowski, but he makes big money for a tight end, and Brown would want loads more). I don’t see it, but we’ll see if Bill Belichick breaks his way of doing things.

Could there be an officiating scandal in the NFL? From Kraig S., of Amarillo, Texas: “I read the ESPN story about former NBA official Tim Donaghy and the possibility he fixed games to benefit those gambling on the games he officiated. I am not looking to throw fuel to another conspiracy theory about missed calls and favoritism. What I am more interested in is what the NFL does to ensure the integrity of its games. Does the NFL have standards/practices in place to try and catch or avoid ‘game fixing’ by its officials?”

The NFL does do a lot to ensure purity of officiating, but never say never. I’ve always thought it would be very hard to fix an NFL game, unless you had a full seven-man officiating crew on board. Suppose a sharp guy paid off a back judge before a big game, and the game never had any sort of contested call deep downfield and the game was decided at other areas of the field. What good would it do to have the back judge in the bag? To be safe, I called former NFL ref Terry McAulay the other day, and he told me the league does an FBI-type background check on each prospective official, and then once every three years after that; does a credit check regularly to see that no irregularities are happening in an officials bank or investment accounts; mandates that each officials be checked out by the local NFL team’s security chief; prohibits all officials from entering a casino during the season; prohibits all officials from gambling on any sports event. “I’m very, very confident the level of integrity of the NFL officials is beyond reproach,” McAulay told me. It’s not something I’ve heard very much about in my 35 years covering the league.

The restrictive pool of head coaches. From Bob T. of Woodbury, Minn.: “Is the NFL putting too much emphasis on the young coaching push based on the results of basically one coach [Sean McVay]?”

I think so. Bill Parcells told me last month he fears that the young coaches being hired are smart X-and-O guys but don’t have the experience leading a room full of players—because many of them have never had to do it before. It’s hard, he said, to learn that stuff on the job.

10 Things I Think I Think

1. I think I’ll take a crack at Antonio Brown’s landing spot here, keeping a few things in mind: He’s significantly hurt his market value (no kidding) since going AWOL from the Steelers the last week of the regular season and since going all scorched-earth on the Steelers in the last six weeks. The fact that GM Kevin Colbert would say he’s had three teams reach out about trading for the first player in history to catch 100 balls six years in a row tells you the market on Brown will be limited. (Three? If Brown didn’t have his baggage, it’d be 13.) But here’s my top choices for his smartest landing spot:

• Carolina. New owner David Tepper, a Pittsburgh guy, went to Pitt and then Carnegie Mellon, and donated $55 million to CMU, which now has a Tepper School of Business in his honor. He bought a 5 percent stake in the Steelers in 2009, preceding his purchase of the Panthers last year. So he’ll know the holes in Brown’s persona, but he’ll also know the difference Brown could make in a passing game that needs a downfield threat. Brown has averaged 114 catches and 1,524 yards a year for the past six years with the deep-armed Ben Roethlisberger, and he’ll be motivated to keep the distractions to a minimum so he can earn a new deal. Tepper is motivated to inject new life into a 24-25 team since Carolina’s Super Bowl appearance three years ago. Though GM Marty Hurney is a conservative type by nature, I think he could be convinced to take a shot on this get-rich-quick scheme. It’d thrill Cam Newton too.

• Washington. A smart guy in the league told me the other day: “Look for the desperate teams with Brown.” What team is more desperate than Washington, which is hemorrhaging fans, has no idea who the 2019 quarterback will be, has no idea who the 2020 coach will be, hasn’t won a playoff game in 14 years, and has an embattled owner searching for anything that will get his team out of the muck and mire of mediocrity? This also fits the Pittsburgh plan of wanting to send Brown out of the AFC. The problem, obviously, would be finding a quarterback to get the ball to Brown. But Washington’s a team that loves to win the offseason and hasn’t done so in a while. I’d be surprised if Bruce Allen and Kevin Colbert don’t talk about Brown.

• Tampa Bay. Dot-connecting. DeSean Jackson wants a new start out of Tampa. The new coach of the Bucs, Bruce Arians, was the Steelers’ play-caller in 2011, when Brown had his breakout NFL season. Arians wants to throw the ball deep more than any head coach in football. Makes sense to me.

• New York Jets. Makes a ton of sense, because the Jets aren’t averse to spending big in free agency so why would they be averse to making a big deal? I’ve maintained that Robby Anderson and a fairly high pick would be a fair trade, because it would rid the Steelers of the Brown headache and, though the Jets and Steelers meet this fall in New Jersey, wouldn’t mean the Steelers would be dealing him to anything but an occasional on-field rival. This is the franchise where Santonio Holmes went to disappear nine years ago. Anderson and JuJu Smith-Schuster would be a formidable receiver duo for the next few years too.

• Oakland. The Raiders have five first-round picks in the next two drafts (their own two, Chicago’s in 2019 and 2020, and the Cowboys’ this year), and Jon Gruden is a trading machine. Though it’s an AFC team, they don’t play each other till at least 2020.

• The others. I don’t see San Francisco, unless Jerry Rice gets hired as GM … Arizona could send the first pick in the second round this year, straight up, which seems like a fair deal … Green Bay could make Brown the receiver very happy. Not impossible, but hard to see such a straight-laced organization with a young head coach trying to find his footing taking the plunge.

2. I think the Rams are praying left tackle Andrew Whitworth comes back for one more season (at $10.7 million in the last year of his three-year free-agent contract). For now, the 37-year-old Whitworth plans to meet with the team post-combine to discuss his future. The team could really use one more year of excellent play and offensive-line stability out of him. If free-agent left guard Rodger Saffold leaves for a payday, the Rams would certainly want the stability of Whitworth on the left side of the line, perhaps moving 2018 third-rounder Joseph Noteboom into Saffold’s spot if Whitworth stays. But if Whitworth goes, the pressure could be on Noteboom, a three-year left-tackle starter at TCU, to slide into Whitworth’s spot.

3. I think, speaking of intriguing Rams free agents, I expect Ndamukong Suh and safety Lamarcus Joyner to sign elsewhere, and pass-rusher Dante Fowler Jr., could also go. And if Saffold, Suh, Joyner and perhaps Fowler sign for big money collectively and the Rams don’t venture into free agency much, they could have a replay of this year’s Compensatory Pick load. L.A., as I showed earlier, got two third-round comp-picks by letting Trumaine Johnson and Sammy Watkins walk, and those two players were major disappointments with the Jets and Chiefs, respectively. Of the four potential defectors, Fowler is probably the player whose loss would be felt most in 2019, because the Rams just don’t have an edge presence on their roster after Fowler.

4. I think I don’t have a lot of dealings with college coaches, and so when I do, I like to ask them questions other than the one I might have reached out for. So last week I asked Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley if he was tempted to pursue an NFL head-coaching job this year, and whether he might be in the future. The reply of the well-respected Riley: “I certainly wasn’t tempted at all this year. I would say right now it wouldn’t surprise me at all if I am a college lifer. I think it’ll be interesting how a lot of things go on from here … if there’s a lot of changes in both games. Football is evolving; there’s a lot of changes obviously at the NFL level right now. There’s a lot of changes with all the transfers and recruiting and all the different things going on at the college level. You never know how those games are going to evolve. I might’ve been tempted honestly had I not been at a place like Oklahoma. But this is one of the best jobs there is in football. Like I’ve said before, I’ll never say never. I never want to promise things that I can’t 1,000 percent guarantee. It’s not something that really tempts me at all right now.”

5. I think that’s a no, sort of, the same way Stanford’s David Shaw is a no. And those are the two most respected NFL head-coaching candidates on the offensive side of the ball in college football today.

6. I think, regarding throwing or not throwing or not working out on-field at the combine: It doesn’t matter. At all. I’ve said this annually for years: I have never heard an NFL GM or coach say, after that draft, We downgraded Player X on our board because he didn’t work out at the combine. So big deal if Dwayne Haskins throws and Kyler Murray throws (and I don’t even know if that will be the outcome).

7. I think the more I think about it, the more logical Nick Foles-to-Jacksonville sounds. Unless, of course, the fun dream scenario happens: Jon Gruden picks Kyler Murray and trades Derek Carr to Jacksonville in the middle of the first round April 25.

8. I think I don’t normally write about media relations staffs, but this occurred to me watching Lester Holt lead the night news Friday with the Robert Kraft story: Whatever Kraft pays Stacey James and his Patriots PR staff, it’s not enough.

9. I think watching the Christian Hackenberg lowlights in the AAF is downright depressing.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Story of the Week: by Patricia Mazzei of the New York Times, on the day spa raided by the police in Jupiter, Fla., the scandal that ensnared Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

b. Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County, Fla., deflected blame from the trafficked women and onto the customers of the spa. “The monsters are the men,” Snyder told Mazzei.

c. TV Series of the Week: “Surviving R. Kelly,” the Lifetime series that focused the law on the rapper and led to his arrest late in the week. Top-notch journalism by Lifetime.

d. Political Series of the Week: “The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth,” on Showtime, is one of the coolest shows about Washington that I’ve seen. It’s real, and it’s spectacular, and it shows how D.C. really works.

e. Very rarely do I see any event a second time, but I made an exception with family in New York last week. We saw “Come From Away” a few months after I’d seen it the first time. It was just as emotional and satisfying the second time.

f. You don’t know “Come From Away?” It’s a Broadway play about the tiny Canadian town, Gander, Newfoundland, that welcomed thousands of stranded travelers for days after 9/11, when U.S. airspace was closed an international flights needed a place to land. When you lose faith in humanity, see “Come From Away.”

g. Coffeenerdness: I’ve been on tea, an ocean of it, for about 16 days, trying to get well after the football season. Tazo Orange, with a thick slice of squeezed lemon, is the best.

h. Beernerdness: Not been in the mood for much beer in recent days, but I did have a Kronenbourg 1664 (Kronenbourg Brewery, Strasbourg, France) after seeing “Come From Away,” and it was marvelous. Best served ice cold. Like revenge.

i. The lousy thing about being sick for more than two weeks? You spend a couple of days, at least, every week working out and staying in some sort of shape anticipating having more time to do so in the off-season. And then it’s over. You’re back to ground zero. I hate that.

j. I wouldn’t get too fired up about the pitch clock ruining baseball.

k. RIP Peter Tork, the cool guy in the Monkees, who passed away from tongue cancer last week.

l. Hey, when you’re 10, and you memorize every word to every top 40 song (as I did in 1967), songs like “Daydream Believer” stick with you for a half century.

m. And RIP Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe. So many of you have told me you play 20 minutes of hooky from work on Monday morning to read this column. (Which is the biggest continuous honor of my career.) On so many Sundays, when I should be spending time researching some NFL thing or other, I did the exact same with Cafardo’s Boston Globe baseball column. I’m a baseball nerd, made that way in part by the Peter Gammons notes column he invented for the Globe, and continued in Gammonsian fashion by Cafardo. Nick died suddenly at Red Sox camp Thursday morning. He was 62. I knew him only a bit, but all those who knew him well said he was the kindest and most generous guy in the business.

n. I love the fact that Cafardo’s last story was about a nice guy: World Series MVP Steve Pearce, back with the Red Sox for one more season.

o. Here is how the story ended, with Pearce talking about what it was like for him to return to the team he won the World Series with—the last words Nick Cafardo ever wrote:

“This is what baseball is all about,” Pearce said. “I’ve been a lot of places. When you find that perfect place to play baseball, you know it. This was it for me. For me, it was a no-brainer. If they wanted me back, I was willing to do what it takes to do it. I didn’t have to look around very long. In fact, I didn’t have to look at all. We worked it out and now I get to defend a title with the team I want to be with.”

And the Red Sox, throwing age aside, got themselves an MVP. Most Valuable Player and Most Valuable Person.

Brexit - it seems like it took forever, but now it's finally upon us - with the UK leaving the EU on 31 January 2020.

When the referendum was first announced, Kanye and Jay-Z were still friends and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hadn't even met yet.

Sir Alex Ferguson was managing in the Premier League and Will.i.am and Britney were number one.

Here are some of the key moments in the Brexit timeline - with a little help from Adele, Pokemon and Leicester City.

23 January 2013: Referendum is announced

Image copyright Getty Images

Prime Minister David Cameron announces that the UK will get a ""very simple in or out choice"" on EU membership - if the Conservatives win the next election.

Willi.i.am's Scream & Shout, featuring Britney Spears, is top of the charts and Barack Obama has just started his second term as US president.

8 May 2015: Conservatives win the general election

Fast forward two years, and the Conservatives win the election outright and Ed Miliband resigns as Labour leader.

Meanwhile, emoji becomes the fastest growing language in the UK, according to a university professor.

20 February 2016: David Cameron sets referendum date

After finishing renegotiations on the UK's relationship with the EU, David Cameron announces that there will be a referendum on 23 June 2016.

A few days later, Adele cleans up at the Brit Awards, winning best British single for Hello, best British album, best British female solo artist and the global success award.

23 June 2016: The UK votes to leave the EU

Image copyright Allsport/Getty Images

The fact that Leicester City are Premier League champions is still sinking in.

The referendum is held, and the UK votes to leave the EU. David Cameron announces his resignation as prime minister.

A few days later, England lose 2-1 to Iceland in Euro 2016, and Roy Hodgson resigns as manager - while Wales make it all the way to the semi-finals.

13 July 2016: Theresa May becomes prime minister

Image copyright Getty Images

Prince Harry has recently gone on a blind date with US actress Meghan Markle - although the world won't know this until a few months later.

Theresa May becomes the UK's new prime minister and promises to lead a ""one nation"" government that works for all not just the ""privileged few"".

The country spends the rest of the summer getting into mass brawls, using phones while driving and trespassing onto railway tracks - all to try and catch some Pokemon.

2 October 2016: Theresa May announces Brexit date

Image copyright PA

Sam Allardyce has just left his post as England manager after he was secretly filmed discussing how to ""get around"" international football rules, and Gareth Southgate takes temporary charge.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have recently split after 12 years together - as have Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston after three months.

Prime Minister Theresa May announces that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - which seems like an age away.

29 March 2017: Article 50 is triggered

Prime Minister Theresa May calls a surprise general election for June, and it's predicted the Conservative party will win easily.

The UK has another thing on its mind as well - Ed Sheeran's new album ÷ (Divide) is taking the charts by storm.

8 June 2017: Election result is revealed

Image copyright Getty Images

In a shock result, the Conservative Party loses its majority in the House of Commons which makes it a lot harder for Theresa May to pass future laws.

The UK - and the world - are at the height of Reggaeton-mania, with Despacito reigning in the charts.

8 December 2017: First phase of Brexit talks ends

Image copyright Getty Images

A last-minute deal between the EU and UK is agreed.

It says there will be no ""hard border"" between the UK and Ireland, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be protected, and the so-called ""divorce bill"" will cost around £39bn.

Meanwhile every Sunday, the whole nation's getting its mind blown by David Attenborough's Blue Planet II.

9 July 2018: Resignations from the Cabinet

Image copyright Getty Images

A day after Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also resigns. It's over Theresa May's ""Cheqeurs plan"" for leaving the EU.

But England's attention is focused on Russia and Gareth Southgate's waistcoat for the upcoming World Cup semi-final against Croatia. It's England's best chance to reach a final in a generation.

14 November 2018: UK and EU agree withdrawal agreement

Image copyright Getty Images

Theresa May agrees the text of the withdrawal agreement with the EU, but it's not well-received back in the UK.

12 December 2018: Theresa May wins vote of no confidence

Image copyright Reuters

Conservative MPs who are unhappy with the prime minister's performance trigger a vote of no confidence in her as party leader - which she wins by 200 to 117.

16 January 2019: Theresa May wins another vote of no confidence

Image copyright Getty Images

This time, the vote of no confidence is for the whole of parliament to vote on - not just the Conservatives. It comes after the prime minister's Brexit deal was voted down by MPs.

Theresa May wins again - this time 325 to 306.

In the National Television Awards, Ant and Dec win - again - for best presenter, making it 18 wins in a row.

18 February 2019: MPs quit their parties

Image copyright Getty Images

Seven Labour MPs quit their party because of issues which include Brexit. They're joined by another Labour and three Conservative MPs over the next few days.

Meanwhile, there is a new twist in the story of Empire actor Jussie Smollett - who had claimed he was attacked two men in a homophobic and racist incident.

Police in Chicago say the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has changed and later arrest and charge him ""disorderly conduct/filing a false police report"".

10 March 2019: Prime Minister comes back with legal changes

12 March 2019: Second meaningful vote

Image copyright Getty Images

What a thrashing!

With just 16 days before Britain is due to leave the European Union - MPs overwhelmingly reject Theresa May's Brexit deal for a second time.

On the same night Manchester City handed a thrashing of their own - they beat German side Schalke 7-0 (8-2 on aggregate) to secure a Champions League quarter final spot.

10 April 2019: Brexit deadline extended to 31 October

Image copyright Getty Images

Some things you just can't get enough of. Game of Thrones, for instance, or time left to leave the EU.

In the same week that the UK was granted an extension of the Article 50 period to 31 October, the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones hit screens.

The end of Game of Thrones doesn't go down too well with viewers, with more than 1.8 million people signing a petition to have the whole thing re-done because they didn't like how it ended.

24 July 2019: Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister

Image copyright Getty Images

OMG, more than a million people are going to storm Area 51 in America to discover the secrets about aliens the US government are keeping secret!

Except it never happens - despite all the interest on social media. Things do get serious enough for an official warning to be issued, though.

Something that does happen in July 2019 is that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, following Theresa May's resignation announcement on 24 May.

28 October 2019: Another pushback, this time until 31 January

Image copyright Getty Images

Boris Johnson promised he would ""get Brexit done"" when he became PM, but if there's one person we really trust to get things done after what goes down in October 2019, it'd be Coleen Rooney.

She outs her mate........... Rebekah Vardy's account as the person allegedly selling stories on her to the tabloids, resulting in one of the most gripping celebrity stories of the year - it's the sort of can-do attitude many people believe the UK was built upon.

Boris Johnson does manage to secure another Brexit extension, though.

12 December: Conservatives win the general election

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jacqueline Jossa returns from Australia - a day before Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds get the keys back to Number 10

While the UK's celebrating Jacqueline Jossa becoming queen of the jungle, an (arguably) more important vote is about the take place.

The third general election in five years results in the Conservative party getting a huge majority - they go from having fewer than half of the 650 MPs in the House of Commons, to 365.

Christmas comes early for Conservatives in the UK - and the result pretty much ends the arguments around whether the UK leaves or remains in the UK.

The 31 January leaving date is on.

31 January 2019: The UK leaves the EU

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kobe Bryant: London Lions basketball team pay tribute

That's it, we're off (from 11pm). Although nothing really changes on the day the UK officially leave the EU.

Not that Big Ben will bong us out, though.

But it's somehow not the biggest news story of the week (that's the spread of the coronavirus). It's not even the second.

That's because in the same week as Brexit finally happens, US basketball star Kobe Bryant is killed, alongside his daughter, in a helicopter accident.

TRUMP STILL SEES NORTH KOREA DEAL 'DOWN THE LINE': In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity following the abrupt end to his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Trump said he remains hopeful that a denuclearization deal will eventually be made with the rogue nation ... ""He’s a different kind of a guy, and I just said, look, this isn’t going to be working,"" Trump said. ""I have feeling something down the line will happen. And it'll happen, it'll be good."" While Trump sought a complete denuclearization in the Vietnam summit, North Korea wanted only to ""de-nuke certain areas,"" the president explained, adding that he was reluctant to ease sanctions. Still, Trump said, Kim has promised not to resume testing nuclear missiles and he believes Vietnam summit was productive. “I think we had a very good two days, but I just don’t think maybe either of us were ready,” he said.

HOW COHEN UNDERMINED THE ‘COLLUSION’ NARRATIVE: Testimony this week by former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen has undermined Democrats’ longstanding claims that President Trump's team colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson says ... In his opening commentary on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Thursday, the Fox News host cited four key moments from Cohen's Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight and Reform Committee: (1) Cohen told members of the House panel he's never been to the Czech Republic. A key allegation in the Russia collusion narrative is that Cohen met with Russian agents in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2016 to help secure a Trump election win. (2) Cohen said he had ""no reason to believe"" a rumored salacious videotape of Trump with prostitutes even exists (3) Cohen said he saw no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia (4) Cohen said Trump never directed him to lie to Congress. Click here to watch Tucker Carlson's must-see commentary.

MAXINE WATERS CALLS FOR TRUMP FOUNDATION PROBE: With the dust still settling from Michael Cohen’s explosive public testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., on Thursday called for a full investigation into the Trump Foundation, President Trump’s former nonprofit organization, which she asserted was a front for tax evasion and other illicit transactions ... ""There's one thing that I think should not be missed that came out of the hearing,"" said Waters, who heads the House Financial Services Committee. ""And that is how [Trump] directed payments into the foundation to keep from paying taxes,"" the Washington Post reported. Following Cohen's testimony on Wednesday, House Oversight Committee Republicans on Thursday referred the ex-Trump attorney to the Justice Department for alleged perjury, claiming he lied during sworn testimony before the panel about a number of issues.

SHOWING AOC WHO'S 'BOSS'? CUOMO TRIES TO WOO AMAZON BACK TO NYC: It may be more proof that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn’t the darling of all Democrats in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., has reportedly penned a full-page letter to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as he clings to hope that he can win back the tech giant and lure it to New York City, where it recently scrapped plans to build a second headquarters campus, a report said Thursday ... The open letter, signed in support by more than 70 unions and politicians, including former Mayor David Dinkins, urged Bezos and Amazon executives to reconsider its decision to pull out of the project, the New York Times reported. The letter, paid for by the Partnership for New York City, was set to appear in Friday’s edition of the Times. Amazon’s pullout followed a campaign by Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives against the plan, which they argued was a massive tax break for a large corporation and would drive less-affluent residents out of city neighborhoods.

KUDLOW AT CPAC: ‘PUT SOCIALISM ON TRIAL’: Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Thursday implored conservative activists not to ""stand idly by"" amid the rise of socialism on the left ... ""I want you to put socialism on trial,” Kudlow said during a speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, outside Washington. ""I don’t want us to stand idly by. I don’t want to let this stuff fester. I want it challenged. I want it debated. I want it rebutted. And I want to convict socialism.” Kudlow also slammed Democrats' embrace of the Green New Deal and ""Medicare-for-all."" Go to Fox Nation for full coverage and highlights from CPAC 2019.

WHO'S THE REAL RACIST HERE? - ""What I'd like to ask the congresswoman from Michigan is, why does she take the word of a self-confessed perjurer and criminally convicted white man over a black female who's highly educated, rose up through the ranks of one of the most competitive companies in real estate, spoke before 25 million people at the Republican National Convention and now works in one of the most historic administrations in history? That is more racist than being put up there as quote-unquote prop."" – Trump administration official Lynne Patton, on ""Fox & Friends,"" defending her presence at Michael Cohen's public hearing before House Oversight Committee after freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib called her a ""prop."" WATCH

I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power. – Michael Cohen, speaking to the U.S. Congress, February 27, 2019

It’s the silences – the things left out and sent down the “memory hole” – that strike me most in the United States’ Orwellian capitalist and white-supremacist media.

Urban Racism as a Nonstory

Here in Chicago, the Jussie Smollett and R. Kelly cases were recently all the local media rage. By contrast, recent reports that 63 Black people have so far been exonerated after having bags of heroin and cocaine planted on them by the Chicago police (at the Ida B. Wells housing project earlier in this century) are just blips on the dominant media screen. Many of the victims served long prison sentences.

This is unsurprising to people who track racial media bias. The Smollett and Kelly stories match the predominantly white viewing public’s conditioned attachment both to celebrity and to racism-denial. The Smollett case involves a Black television star who appears to have staged a fake racist assault. The Kelly story plugs into the longstanding white image of Black men as sexual predators (and to say that is not to deny that Kelly is likely a predator).

The evidence-planting story is about institutional police state racism. That’s not a popular plotline in the audience targeted by the 10 O’clock News’ commercial sponsors.

Meanwhile, violence in the Black ghettoes continues to be a nightly news obsession in Chicago as across urban America. By contrast, the underlying, violence-generating nature of social and economic conditions in those segregated, opportunity-bereft neighborhoods is a perpetual non-story (kind of like the deletion of climate change from the nightly weather reports).

Socialist City Council Triumphs Not Fit for Prime Time

Metropolitan television reporting and commentary on the first round of Chicago’s mayoral and aldermanic elections last Tuesday is another example. The local news teams were all over the spectacular failure of big money white male candidate Bill Daley (the son and brother of two legendary long-term Chicago mayors named Richard) to make it to the two-person mayoral run-off election in April. The story on local television Tuesday night was about identity – how the run-off election will be between two Black females, Toni Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot, one of whom (Lightfoot) is gay.

Lost in the coverage was the fact that each of the two final candidates can be expected to run Chicago’s City Hall in accord with the commands of the city’s leading corporate, real estate, and financial interests.

Also not meriting serious discussion Tuesday night was the remarkable fact that self-declared socialists – actual grassroots opponents of the city’s corporate and political machine – won in two of the city’s fifty wards and made it to the run-off in three more. Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) members ran in six Chicago wards. They won flat-out (with no run-off required) in the 35th ward (Northwest Side), where DSA member and City Council incumbent Carlos Ramirez-Rosa got 60% of the vote, and in the 1st Ward (North Side), where DSA member and aldermanic challenger Dan La Spata got 61%. DSA member Byron Sigcho-Lopez won the top run-off spot in the 25th ward (Southwest Side). DSA member Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez tied for the top run-off spot in the 33rd ward (Northwest Side). DSA member Andre Vasquez won the second run-off sport with 20% in the 40th ward (Northwest Side), where another DSA member (Ugo Okere) got 14%.

As someone who has followed Chicago political history for many years, I have to say that this is a remarkable development. The city is poised to have more openly “socialist” City Council members than any time since the 1910s, when Chicago voters elected several aldermen from Eugene Debs’ Socialist Party.

“The oligarchs are shaking in their boots tonight,” Ramirez-Rosa told a crowd last Tuesday evening. The defeat of Daley, who spent $8.7 million dollars, including $1 million from Illinois’ richest man, hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, is just the tip of the iceberg. The real threat to the city’s neoliberal Robber Barons comes from the bottom up, in the neighborhoods.

Cohen’s Warning: “If He Loses…No Peaceful Transition”

Another example of telling television silence was on display on the national stage two days ago. After Michael Cohen’s dramatic testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives, CNN and MSNBC talking heads rambled on and on about Cohen’s comments on the Trump Tower meeting, Trump’s sickening racism, Roger Stone, WikiLeaks, Trump’s corrupt foundation money dealings, Trump’s inflated assets, and Trump’s youthful bone-spur draft-dodging. Also drawing attention were the histrionics of the Republican Congressmen who attacked Cohen’s credibility and the asinine stunt pulled by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-GA), who pathetically used a Black woman as a mute stage-prop to buttress his idiotic claim that Trump could not possibly be a racist since the woman holds a position in the Trump administration.

Curiously denied remotely comparable attention was something remarkable Cohen said during his final statement to Congress. “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump,” Cohen remarked, “I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”

That would seem to have been a highly newsworthy comment. The president’s longtime personal attorney, confidante, and “fixer” Michael Cohen wanted Congress to know that Trump will not leave the White House peacefully if he is defeated in the Electoral College. Cohen told the House and the U.S. populace that Trump poses a dictatorial threat to the last vestiges of electoral democracy in the U.S.

That was a big deal. And yet I saw one CNN talking head after another ignore Cohen’s warning when the network’s host Anderson Cooper asked them “what leapt out at you during Cohen’s testimony?”

No serious journalist should find Cohen’s warning excessive. As a Canadian correspondent, Matthew Gosse, wrote me yesterday, “In 2016, [Trump] made it quite clear that he wanted to see blood in the streets in the event that he lost. He insinuated repeatedly that the election was ‘rigged’ [against him] and that the people would know that it had been stolen if any other event other than his victory was the outcome.”

Trump has already repeatedly laid the rhetorical foundation for claiming that a 2020 election loss by him will be illegitimate because of supposed illegal immigrant voter fraud. To make matters worse, a reputable poll has shown that most Republicans would support Trump suspending the 2020 presidential election “if necessary to guarantee a fair election.”

If Trump loses in 2020, he will encourage violence, telling his followers that the vote count is illegitimate. You can take that to Deutsche Bank.

Herr Trump and his authoritarian, white-nationalist Amerikaner base pose a real creeping-fascist threat to the last shreds of bourgeois democracy in the corporate-managed inverted-totalitarian United States.

“Can’t Happen Here”

Why wasn’t Cohen’s ominous warning a bigger part of the corporate media’s treatment of his blockbuster testimony? Maybe the chattering cable skulls are still caught-up in the mindset of “It Can’t Happen Here,” the title of Sinclair Lewis’s dystopian 1935 novel about a fascist American president who follows his election by stamping out the last embers of U.S. democracy. (The lesson of the novel: “The Hell it Can’t.”)

Or maybe it’s because they aren’t really in the business of promoting anything like actual democracy in the U.S. (or anywhere else). The reigning corporate media institutions are consent-manufacturing ideological assets owned by the nation’s unelected and interrelated dictatorships of concentrated wealth and empire. They want Trump replaced by a better and more effective agent of corporate-financial oligarchy and imperialism, not by forces of popular sovereignty.

Could Trump pull off the suspension of the 2020 election or a White House refusal to recognize the election’s results? I find that hard to imagine. The national fetishization of the U.S. Constitution and its republican principles seem to me too strong to permit such “banana republic” developments. But, like all the “it can’t happen here” folks who couldn’t imagine the future dictator Buzz Windrip being elected in Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel, I didn’t think a Trump presidency could happen in 2016.

What seems reasonable beyond a shadow of a doubt is that the orange monstrosity is a creeping fascist – a fact that started to belatedly dawn on Cohen (a descendant of Nazi Holocaust survivors) after Charlottesville – and that he is very likely to try to obstruct the “democratic” U.S. electoral process in ways that go beyond the longstanding bourgeois-constitutional norm in 2020. He will not go away quietly and without bloodshed. It’s no small matter. We’ve been warned yet again, this time by the tangerine mob/nster’s longtime fixer. The media might want to pay more attention."

But the politicians, no matter what, were self-seeking.

It was around two on a Chicago morning when “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was attacked near his apartment by two masked men.

Since then, a month’s worth of unexpected twists have baffled fans and the public alike, and have turned the case into an online debate between public figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum.

Response to the “Attack”

You might recognize Smollett from the popular TV show “Empire,” which is currently in its fifth season. Smollett charmed audiences in his breakout role as Jamal Lyon, a promising singer and one of the three sons of Cookie and Lucious Lyon, former drug-dealer-turned-CEO of Empire Entertainment. The show follows the Lyons’ ongoing turmoil amid interludes of catchy hip-hop music and scenes of explosive family secrets. Like his character, Smollett is black and openly gay, two factors that would be front and center in the “hate crime” against the actor.

When Smollett reported the Jan. 29 attack to Chicago police, he told officers that the two men yelled “racial and homophobic slurs” at him and doused him in an “unknown chemical substance” before placing a noose around his neck. In a second interview, he claimed the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

News of the hate crime quickly spread to every TV talk show and social media platform. Online posts showed viewers’ outrage at a crime obviously motivated by bigotry and racism, with various political figures in vocal support of Smollett. Democrats such as Sen. Kamala Harris labeled the attack “a modern day lynching” in one tweet, Rep. Maxine Waters claimed that Trump was dividing the country and even former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that such hate crimes “must never be tolerated in this country.”

If you’re tuned-in to U.S. culture, it’s plain to see why the Smollett case generated so much vitriol against the two attackers. It seems every week consists of more interactions fraught with homophobia or racism that mirror all too well the highly publicized attack. Stories of homophobic acts and racially charged police brutality have sadly long lost their shock value, but Smollett’s case would soon turn an unbelievable 360 degrees.

A Twist in the Case

A few days after the attack, Smollett released a statement thanking everyone for their support and love, before discussing the ongoing police investigation in the midst of growing skepticism.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The lingering doubts would magnify, however, when, on Feb. 15, Chicago police apprehended two persons of interest who were recorded on surveillance video. They were released without charge, and the case turned: The two men involved in the incident alleged that Smollett had orchestrated the attack himself.

It turns out that the two men, Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, knew Smollett before the incident, as both brothers had played extras in “Empire.” They told police that Smollett had offered to pay them in exchange for helping him stage a hate crime.

They told CBS Chicago, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett unsurprisingly denied the accusations, but the mounting evidence against him is pretty convincing and points to a more intricate story. Phone records collected by police reveal that Smollett spoke on the phone to the brothers before and after the staged attack.

Smollett texted Ola, “Might need your help on the low. You around to talk face to face?”

Dissatisfaction at his $65,000-an-episode salary from “Empire” turned out to be the true reason for Smollett’s scheme. A week prior to the attack at the “Empire” studio, Smollett reported receiving a threatening and homophobic correspondence filled with cut-up letters that spelled “MAGA.”

Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson stated that the actor had written the letter himself to gain publicity. Smollett then turned to staging an attack when the threatening document didn’t receive the exposure he desired.

Afterward, the political aura surrounding the case was peppered with bombshells, this time as Republican figures stole the mic from Democrats. Donald Trump Jr. posted his own Oscar “hoax” category, composed of nominees Nathan Phillips, Christine Ford and Smollett. Conservative political commentator Sean Hannity told viewers that the media would twist any news story if it furthered “the narrative that Donald Trump is evil.” President Trump himself criticized Smollett on his favorite social media outlet, Twitter:

“@JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?”

Politicians Being Politicians

If there’s a major takeaway from the Smollett case, it’s that politicians will use any story to attack their opponents and propel their political agenda. The impulsive nature of politicians swooping in to Smollett’s defense became embarrassingly obvious when many of them retracted their original statements, including Sen. Harris.

“Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I’m sad, frustrated, and disappointed,” Harris posted on her Twitter account. “When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward.”

It’s not surprising that politicians would mold an alleged hate crime to match their political views, but it’s more apparent in the Smollett case because they got ahead of themselves and — most importantly — the story. Republican politicians later mocking Smollett, and Democrats that supported him, only distracted readers from a news story that has yet to reach a definite conclusion.

Over the course of a single month, the controversy has inflicted massive damage onto Smollett’s reputation and career as an actor. The producers of “Empire” cut Smollett’s character, Jamal, from the last few episodes of the fifth season after the actor was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. He has since been released after paying 10 percent of his $100,000 bond.

Smollett may or may not be guilty of planning an attack in the desperate hope of increasing his salary on “Empire,” but if he is indeed behind everything, then the story ultimately comes down to an actor taking advantage of the volatile state of racism and homophobia in America. If nothing else, the Smollett case might give politicians second thoughts the next time they tweet their opinions."

Jussie Smollett being attacked in a hate crime sounded fishy and far-fetched from the jump -- according to a guy who has no love for the ""Empire"" actor -- Milan Christopher.

The ex-""Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood"" star and model tells TMZ ... he believes the ""Empire"" star's alleged attack was an elaborate plot to grow his brand, and it's actually working -- at least on social media.

Milan -- who is gay -- says he smelled a rat from the get-go, especially because Jussie's story changed so much ... and every gay black man will now feel the consequences.

Milan is also incredulous that Jussie referred to himself as ""the gay Tupac.""

Christopher has obvious issues with Jussie, whom he called out earlier this week on Instagram, saying ... ""let me tell y'all a little story about an evil jealous black gay man I once met.""

He insinuated Jussie tried to torpedo his career and block him from scoring a role on ""Empire."" Milan said, ""This insecure jealous queen did everything in their power to keep me from expanding my brand and having a new platform that would empower my reach & expand my 'Empire.'"""

Jussie Smollett, a popular actor and singer-songwriter, was recently arrested and charged with filing a false police report.

Smollett alleged that he was attacked in late January by two white men who spewed racist and homophobic slurs as they assaulted him.

A standout detail was his claim that the assailants said, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett has been very critical of the Trump administration and said he believed this was some sort of retaliation.

Originally viewed as the victim, Smollett is now accused of orchestrating his own attack.

This has created an uproar. Smollett’s attack was a major news story, and a plethora of public figures expressed support for him. The public isn’t only shocked but also outraged by the latest accusations — especially survivors of hate crimes.

This situation hits close to home. Though I was never physically assaulted, I’ve been targeted for harassment due to my sexuality.

It’s been a challenging journey navigating between two crucial factors of my identity; I am both Black and gay. In the spring of 2015, a fake advertisement was posted on a college social app. The advertisement listed my college apartment number and was advertising for men to come over.

It was written as if it were a woman. I was gone at the time, but men began coming to my apartment looking for sex. My classmate who lived in my complex saw the ad and let me know.

It was embarrassing because other students had seen the ad. I contacted both campus security and the police. Nothing happened. I still have no closure on this incident.

In the fall of 2015, I was leaving class with a friend. A car followed us while its passengers yelled homophobic slurs at me, chasing me into a corner. This was caught on tape by security cameras.

I alerted campus security, and although they saw the clear visuals on the tape, nothing happened. Since it was a verbal bashing, they didn’t think it was a real threat (never mind my being chased by a car).

It was a Christian university. Since then, I’ve always wondered what they would do if I were a straight, white male who was verbally bashed and chased with evidence on tape.

Though both of these events left an impact, I’m lucky that it was no worse. Due to the current divisive state of our country, hate crimes have been on the rise across most categories.

In particular, there’s been a spike in hate crimes regarding race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The Human Rights Campaign reported that in 2017, 29 transgender individuals were brutally killed. This is the highest ever recorded — though the 26 transgender individuals murdered last year comes close.

In fact, hate crimes have been on the rise for three consecutive years, according to the FBI. As a Black man and a gay man — a member of two marginalized groups often targeted — this is a source of constant fear and anxiety.

Unlike Smollett’s case, which was an extremely rare case of possible false reporting, rights groups estimate that far more real incidents go unreported.

Hatred is still prevalent. Whether verbal or physical, these attacks are very real and can carry fatal outcomes. The Jussie Smollett episode shouldn’t distract us from this. One man may have lied, but the real story is how many lives are still threatened.

Please don’t stop supporting victims of hate crimes or advocating for justice.

The Democratic Party is now the Communist Party.

A lot of people are putting themselves in harms way to ensure our freedom and many have died for that freedom that many take for granted.

This country is so much in debt that it will never see daylight again. Medical and whatever is not free someone has to pay for it. Obamacare is a bad joke and reminds me of what one of my doctors told me “you get what you paid for.” Today we have insurance companies telling our doctors what they can or cannot do to treat us. Maybe they should be sued for malpractice.

Everyone on medicare pays for it every month. It isn’t a government gift and everyone on it had it taken out of their paycheck while they were still working. So if you think you can keep the insurance (you) already have dream on.

Take a good look at the Venezuelan people. At one time they wanted something for nothing and lost their freedom and are now suffering famine because they fell for the lies of socialism/communism — same thing.

Civil society's critical mass

From a Psychosis Database Record: “Research in anti-social traits and behaviors, lay theories, varied by participants' race and their race-related attitudes and motivations, support the prediction that lay theories of racism reflect the natural desire to distance the self from any aspect or category of being racist.”

So why this rush toward it? In the name of Nathan Phillips' the Covington fiasco, and more recently the Jussie Smollett hate-crime story in last week's news feeds, self-inflicted victimhood is the sickness and in all probability the motive for sympathetic footing. As these stories began unraveling an injustice was done to our history and the issues of race relations in America.

But even more disturbing is the speed with which the Phillips and Smollett stories were iterated. Leftist politicos, the press, even Hollywood lefties without blinking an eye, wasted no time in crafting a defection. Hate crime hoaxes reflect a sickness in America that racial divide is still on par with the embarrassment and denial of these “Dixiecrat” and their racially charged pasts. Such petulance, such disregard for an America that they, on one hand, celebrate as inclusive and on the other, rather denigrate and divide us.

In the Phillips and now Smollett news stories, this new left is screaming for merciless sympathy. This should arouse the rest of us to ask questions of those whom believed Phillips or Smollett, and rushed to point an accusatory finger at anybody other than themselves. What has happened to the left indeed, that they could sink that low?

Proof of election fraud

Well now, we all have definite proof, we do indeed need voter I.D.

Everyone now knows there is, can be, and will be, more election fraud.

Since we agree, then anyone who doesn't agree is a denier, and they are probably racist, homophobic, anti-muslim, and on and on — etc.

Hey Steve, I started looking older when the Dems made California a Sanctuary State. That's when I developed a scowl that gets worse whenever I think of the damage done by these same politicians to our educational system and employment opportunities.

California is a prime example of the downward spiral associated with identity politics.

Republican news perspective

According to the Right Wing, all working class Americans only want to soak the rich. The far right poll by Politico (shows) total support for raising taxes on the rich. On incomes over $10 million the American public says we should raise taxes to 70 percent while those Americans who oppose are at the 24 percent level. On incomes over 1 million, 65 percent approve. Over $250,000, 44 percent approve.

Republicans despise the American ideal of fairness, it is not in their DNA, it is a mortal sin to think about and love others and follow Christian ideals. Senators recently, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, came up with the 99.8% Act. Bottom line: it creates a 45 percent tax on the value of an estate between $3.5 and $10 million. A 50 percent tax on estates worth between $10 and $50 million. A 55 percent tax on estates worth $50 million and 77 percent on a $1 billion estate.

Lastly, it closes tax loopholes that allowed billionaire families to pass their fortunes on to others. The 588 billionaire families in America have a net worth of $3 trillion and would pay $2 to $3 trillion more in estate taxes, money that America needs and could use for the greater needs of the United States of America!

This is just one of the most recent updates surrounding the Jussie Smollett case. The full story line stretches a month long, garnering the attention of news outlets and audiences across the nation along the way– and it’s still not over.

In case you missed it, here’s a quick rundown. According to CBS News, Smollett, who is black and openly gay, filed a report that day that detailed an attack made on him by two masked men. The two men allegedly hung a noose around Smollett’s neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, all the while hurling racist and homophobic remarks. To top it off, they allegedly yelled “This is MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

This story in particular is unique in that it is chock full of theatrical elements as well as plenty of leaked information, but considerably less full of factual evidence. Most headline stories updating the public were riddled with information attributed to “unnamed law enforcement sources.” Now, several twists and turns later, having poured countless resources into the investigation, Chicago police say they have “shifted their trajectory.”

There are a few reasons Smollett’s story has captivated a nation-wide audience. The first and main reason being the theory that Smollett staged the entire attack, shifting him from victim to suspect. With each development in the story, the probability of a hoax seems more and more likely. Despite this, Smollett continues to presume his innocence.

According to NBC News, Smollett’s legal team released a statement after the indictment stating: “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Another reason for this story’s large-scale audience is that it directly involves a celebrity. Naturally, many other celebrities rallied to support Smollett after the initial report of the attack. Others openly posed their suspicions. Almost everyone was quick to take to social media to express their opinions. Some, apparently, may have done so a bit too quickly, sparking conversations regarding confirmation bias and media literacy.

On Jan. 30, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the attack made on Smollett via Twitter. Nearly three weeks later, after it was revealed that the attack was allegedly staged, the tweet was deleted. According to Vanity Fair on Feb. 18, a spokesman for Pelosi said, “Given the turn in the investigation, we decided to no longer amplify the original accusation.”

This stresses the importance of withholding judgement until all the true facts of any story are revealed, something the responsible news consumer would never fail to do.

As each new leak made headlines, people were all too eager to favor whichever narrative confirmed their biases before any further critical details emerged. “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah touched on the situation during the Feb. 21 episode, stating, “That’s when I think you have to be even more vigilant, is when (a story) confirms everything you’ve believed.”

If Smollett is convicted he will face a potential sentence of up to three years in prison as well as “restitution to compensate for the cost of the investigation,” according to NBC News. In the meantime, let’s all try to practice savvy media consumption by allowing our biases to standby as we patiently wait for the full scoop."

Chicago police said Ola and Abel Osundairo told them while they were being interrogated that Smollett paid them to fake the alleged attack. Smollett has now been charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, a felony in Illinois. He turned himself in on Feb. 21 but has insisted he is not guilty.

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, struck him in the face, ""poured an unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a rope around his neck, according to a police statement at the time. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleged the attackers said ""this is MAGA country.""

CBS Chicago obtained surveillance video of the brothers buying rope and red hats. Although police initially detained them, their cooperation led police to arrest Smollett.

Police said they obtained phone records showing that Smollett spoke with the men about an hour before and after the attack, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a press conference after he was arrested. Smollett also spoke with the men while they were in Nigeria for the two weeks immediately following the attack, Johnson said.

A police report following the death of rapper T.I’s sister Precious has confirmed that she suffered an asthma attack behind the wheel.

Precious died after spending a week in intensive care, following her hospitalisation after a serious car accident.

It had been reported at the time that Precious had an asthma attack, with official police reports now confirming, according to TMZ, her asthma attack caused the fatal collision.

Atlanta PD traffic documents obtained by the publication state Precious had been driving T.I’s Dodge Avenger and she was accompanied in the car by the artist’s grand-niece Kairi Chapman.

Days after Smollett was arrested for allegedly staging a racially-motivated and homophobic attack on himself, the Osundairo brothers have shared their 'tremendous regret' over the incident.

Chicago Police have claimed Smollett hired Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo to help stage a ""phony attack"" on him last month, but that his plan was thwarted because the surveillance camera was not faced in the right direction to capture the beating.

Police say the brothers are co-operating with the investigation and they have now spoken out and have apologised to 'minorities and victims of hate crime' for what they say they have done.

A statement from their attorney read: ""My clients have a tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.""

Smollett said he had been attacked by two masked men in downtown Chicago on January 29, telling police his attackers shouted racist and homophobic abuse and tied a noose around his neck.

The actor, claimed he had been ""forever changed"" by the attack after he claimed he was the victim of a homophobic attack.

Smollett, who came out as gay in 2015, made a tearful appearance on Good Morning America last month but police allege that the attack was a hoax orchestrated by the actor as he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on Fox network drama Empire.

He was then arrested for allegedly staging a racially-motivated and homophobic attack on himself.

Smollett is now being written out of Empire following this sensational turn of events.

In November 2016, the Mets wishfully, fancifully signed Yoenis Cespedes, represented by current general manager Brodie Van Wagenen, to a four-year, $110 million contract. It didn’t matter that Cespedes’ yawning approach to baseball had made him, at 29, expendable to three prior clubs.

Furthermore, the Mets ignored Exhibit A from just three months earlier: Freshly placed on the disabled list, Cespedes played golf. Sandy Alderson, then the Mets’ GM, called that a case of “bad optics.”

That’s the thing with “bad optics.” What looks bad often looks bad because it is. And bad optics are often caused by an excessive sense of self-entitlement as invited by employers.

For example, would Mike Francesa remain a lying, boasting, fabricator of facts and self-inflating stories had his bosses long ago demanded he cut it out?

Regardless, we’re stuck — or blessed — with our own values. Mine aren’t necessarily yours. I’d be less than honest if I approved or ignored optics that gnaw at me enough to write about. Can’t help it.

Saturday, Jim Boeheim showed up on national TV to coach a Syracuse basketball game, 2½ days after accidentally killing a man. Bad optics. His ostensible bosses at the university apparently approved.

It was widely reported that Boeheim, before Saturday’s game, was devastated. I have no doubt that he was and may always be. How could he not?

It also was widely reasoned that Boeheim, on Saturday, was faced with “a tough call.”

How so? On Saturday morning it was reported Boeheim would coach that day, thus the decision was made within two days of the fatality. Too soon, fellas.

By coaching — by not missing even one game after an imponderable tragedy — Boeheim and Syracuse made a bad choice. He should’ve sat this one out, thus no one could fault him and all would understand and admire him rather than risk debate.

Optically, he appeared to have chosen less than the most decent thing he could do.

Then there was excessively self-entitled Charles Barkley. He’s the beloved star of TNT’s NBA studio show on which everything is open for smug, bold, wise-guy discussion — except for the flagrant misconduct of Charles Barkley.

Last week, Barkley had fun with the sensational travails of actor Jussie Smollett:

“America, let me tell you something: Do not commit crimes with checks. If you’re gonna break the law, do not write a check. Get cash, man. … Do not write checks when you commit illegal activity.”

Laughter followed. It was funny. But what many readers couldn’t miss was that the bad optics provided by Barkley again went untouched. Thus, we didn’t hear:

“America, if you’re gonna be drunk while being serviced by a suspected prostitute, don’t do it while driving, get a room, don’t be arrested in a car.”

“America, if you’re an admitted problem gambler, don’t leave $400,000 in gambling markers in a Vegas casino until legal action is threatened. Not everyone is as entitled as I. Heck, I star in Capital One commercials, yet run up debt like that!”

Barkley has admitted to having lost millions to gambling, yet neither he nor the DraftKings folks — who so clearly aim to create young sports gamblers via get-rich-quick come-ons — had the decency to exclude Barkley as the top TV salesman of an enterprise predicated on losing money to gambling.

What kind of man — let alone one who regularly dispenses life-skills lessons on national TV — sells his name and body to peddle what he knows to be poison? And why don’t his pull-no-punches TNT pals, nor anyone else from the pandering media herd, ask him?

But we’re bound to our own sense of optics and entitlements. Some folks can get away with anything, others choose to never try.

Losing sight of genuine racism

It lately has been reasoned that claims of racism have become a commodity, and the demand has surpassed the legitimate supply to the trivialization of genuine racism.

Last week, Gary Dolphin, radio voice of Iowa basketball for 22 years, was suspended for the rest of the season. After a Maryland-Iowa game, he praised 6-foot-10 Maryland player Bruno Fernando, who is black, for playing like “King Kong.”

Analyst Greg Hansen, noting Fernando’s rebounding — he had 11, five of them offensive, and two blocks in a 66-65 road win — casually agreed with Dolphin’s casual assessment.

Dolphin will be reinstated for spring football, but this now is on his permanent record as well as Wikipedia.

Odd, the only public sports figure I’m aware of to have used an ape analogy to degrade a black man was Muhammad Ali, who repeatedly mocked Joe Frazier as “a gorilla.” Ali popularized trash talk and put-down insults, a legacy from which we remain afflicted.

Yet, ESPN named its annual Humanitarian Award for Ali.

Three weeks ago, in a negotiated settlement with ESPN, tennis analyst Doug Adler was at last cleared of the defamation and infamy that he suddenly and for no reason called Venus Williams “a gorilla” when he clearly was admiring her “guerilla” tactics.

Between Adler’s redemption and Dolphin’s suspension, a TV ad appeared for “Gorilla Glue.” The young couple seen pleased with Gorilla Glue’s performance are black.

And while Venus Williams chose not to defend Adler, her sister, Serena Williams, is a major investor in the company SurveyMonkey.

Dolan’s plan right on schedule

Rumors that Jim Dolan soon will sell the Knicks and Rangers are preposterous. Why would he do that just two years short of his 30-year team rebuilding plans?

Craig Carton’s sentencing, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed to March 15.

The Oscar for the most ungracious, brattish, self-entitled, only-I’m-worthy sore loser goes to … Knicks mascot Spike Lee!

Colleges continue to offer multiple “second chances,” but not to scholars — unless they can help win ballgames.

Texas’s Kerwin Roach, despite three suspensions this season for “violations of team rules,” may return — and this season — according to coach Shaka Smart. Well, Roach is the Longhorns’ best player.

Capitals 6, Rangers 5 in overtime Sunday, ran 2:39. That’s 4:29 in MLB time.

Saturday, after Tiger Woods four-putted, then three-putted the next hole, NBC’s instant-mourning mode was palpable. I was expecting the leaderboard to be draped in purple and black, the pins lowered to half-staff.

Desperate to shovel some dirt into the money pit it dug to play Big Ten football, Rutgers recently approved beer and wine sales in its Piscataway stadium.

Piscataway Mayor Brian Wahler told The (Newark) Star-Ledger last week that no one from his office had agreed to the university opening “a 52,000-seat bar” in the township."

Kelly and Jussie Smollett.

While giving an interview to Variety about his new single, Graham was asked about Kelly, who pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse this week.

Graham called the singer “a good friend of mine” and said that he wished him the best.

“I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent,” he added.

He expressed his support for Smollett as well, labeling him “misunderstood.” Smollett is facing criminal charges for allegedly falsifying claims of a hate crime. Graham claims the reports against the actor are false.

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Smollett was arrested last week and charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report. If convicted, he could serve up to three years in prison.

The actor has denied the allegations and maintains that the attack was real and that he was simply a victim of a crime.

Graham – who gained recognition from appearing in a whiskey commercial for Virginia Black alongside his son — was also asked about his new single, “That On That.” Graham stated that he wrote the lyrics to the song 10 years ago. He went on to clarify that they weren’t about anyone specific, though he did have a girlfriend at the time who happened to fit the feel of the lyrics as a clingy, jealous stalker.

“She was always checking my phone. If I was in the other room working on some music, she would be peeping through the door.”

When asked if Drake had shared his thoughts on the song, he admitted that Drake had heard it and had comments.

“Drake was the first one to tell me, ‘Dad, I love that song.’ He sent me a text message actually. Drake heard it when I first did it 10 years ago. He had heard it before because everything that he did, he used to send to me first. And whatever I did, I used to send to him. But now he’s too busy for that, he doesn’t send me anything now.”

Graham was asked if he and Drake had made any music together yet. He said they hadn’t got around to it yet, but “we are definitely going to do something.”"

By now, you’ll have heard about the appalling fraud he perpetrated against the American popular consciousness, a hate crime hoax at once so audacious and so laughably obvious that it represents the apotheosis of a genre I’ve been cataloguing for fun for the last half-decade. Other people have knitting or Sudoku; I keep a tally of progressive hoaxes. Dorky, I admit.

But what you probably don’t know is that Smollett isn’t just the exemplum perfectum of social justice and its insatiable appetite for lurid horror stories, real or imagined. He’s something more: The inevitable, gruesome, twenty-first century millennial product of a radical communist household. And this biographical revelation explains almost everything about how he looks at the world, and what led him to self-immolate in the way he did.

Intellectual history consists largely of showing who was talking to whom and tracing the effects of influential thinkers’ and activists’ ideas. Guess what? You can draw a straight line, through real people, from Herbert Marcuse to Jussie Smollett. It turns out that his mom was, and remains, best friends with Marcuse disciple Angela Davis, the Communist Party candidate for Vice President in 1980 and 1984.

And by Communist, we of course mean “Russia-backed”—not in the speculative wet-dream-CNN-Trump-scandal sense of being backed by Russia, but in the actual, bought-and-paid-for-by-red- devils sense of the phrase.

Angela Davis’s candidacy for Kremlin-funded communists disappears and reappears from her Wikipedia entry all the time. You never know if it’ll be there on a given day. Perhaps that’s because Davis is now somewhat embarrassed by her past as a Communist Party member. Not because it was dangerous and insane, you understand, but because it wasn’t extreme enough. In 2009, she laughed and sneered as she told the head of the NAACP that she really struggled over whether to join the Communist Party because she considered it “so conservative … I wanted to do something more interesting and radical.”

Davis wistfully added that she still sometimes imagined “the possibility of moving beyond the democratic socialist arrangement.” In the same interview, she explained how she was followed by the FBI from the age of six, and taught by her Communist Party parents never to speak to the authorities. Who headed the Communist Party when Davis was six, and died a couple of months after her ninth birthday? That would be Josef Stalin.

Davis was a fan of Jim “Kool-Aid Killer” Jones and hated Solzhenitsyn’s fellow dissidents in Russia. Progressives are regularly mystified when her pathological hatred of Israel presents her with hurdles to professional advancement and various gongs. Needless to say, Davis is now making a living on the diversity circuit on college campuses. These days she’s a professor emerita at UC Santa Cruz, in something called—I kid you not—the “History of Consciousness Department.” She’s also, naturally, a former director of the university’s Feminist Studies department. That’s when she’s not hosting the Smollett family for lunch on Mother’s Day.

Communism isn’t the threat it used to be, despite the best efforts of a few ludicrous Democrat congresswomen. Maybe because it’s hard for North Korea to field a powerful enough army when all they have to eat is grass. But its ideological descendent, third-wave feminism, is busy tearing apart American society. I’ll get in trouble with everyone editing this magazine and just about everyone reading it for saying so, but feminism, the social incarnation of Marxist thought, is way more deadly than communism.

When Marxism became comprehensively discredited as an economic system after the Cold War, its fans in the academy began looking for ways the oppressor/oppressed dynamic might be put to use elsewhere. They discovered there was an almost inexhaustible supply of imaginary social problems that could be examined through that lens. Thus women, minorities, gays and other supposedly marginalized groups were handed victimhood scripts with which to fight their “oppressors.”

No matter the complexities of individual circumstance, the oppressors were always the same: white Western heterosexual male Christian capitalists – just coincidentally the same people economic Marxism had tried and failed to conquer. Hence the birth of what even the Left-wing Atlantic has described as contemporary victimhood chic.

Today’s social justice loonies almost make you wistful for the days of the old hard Left. At least those guys enjoyed a drink and a laugh. Their offspring, the so-called “red diaper babies,” aren’t beyond saving. The most famous one of all is our own David Horowitz. But they do need intervention, lest their parents’ communism metastasize into something even worse. Assuming it’s not already too late.

As Allan Bloom writes in The Closing of the American Mind, feminism has destroyed classic texts far more comprehensively than any previous theoretical lens, because it tears down the great books’ heroes and heaps scorn on their erotic bonds with the women who love them. And as we’ve seen from the last decade of wage gap mythology and moral panics about campus rape culture, driving the sexes apart destroys entire civilizations far more effectively and irrevocably than furious Marxist literature and a few barmy communist activists.

Stripping society of the very idea of virtuous manhood and heroic masculine ideals is just about the only sure-fire route to unraveling everything good about that society, which is why modern feminism and bog-standard Marxism still exist in intricate symbiosis. Communism agitates for control of the means of production. But feminism demands control of the means of reproduction—a far more powerful resource. Communism merely wants to turn women in to workers, but feminism tells them that motherhood is beneath them. Marxists hate success, but feminists hate life itself.

I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Jussie Smollett’s father, who died in 2014 after a long battle with cancer, doesn’t play a very influential role in the story of his early life, and that Smollett, who was raised “in the orbit of the Black Panthers,” therefore turned out to be a gay crypto-communist. Nor that his family, all of whom lent their voices to the self-destructive and ultimately pointless Black Lives Matter movement, moved into roles in the entertainment industry with heavy social-justice overtones.

Little is known about Smollett’s father, a Russian-Polish Jew, but if he too was cozy with the Bobby Rush-Fred Hampton Chicago Panthers—the New York Times is too coy to tell us in its admiring profile of the family—then his father was cozying up to an organization with roots in a notoriously violent street gang called the Blackstone Rangers. What we do know is that the largest presence in young Jussie’s life was his mother and her female friends, women like Angela Davis. Jussie lists Panther founders Bobby Seale, Huey Newton and Julian Bond as some of his mother’s closest intimates.

Smollett’s a very specific kind of homosexual sociopath I recognize from the mirror—I mean, from my years on the gay scene. He’d be first in line to join the SS or the KGB (the latter, probably), because he loves the sexy uniforms and he doesn’t give a shit about other human beings. If he’d learned from a strong, positive masculine role model the heroic manly virtues of courage, integrity, resilience, honesty, hard work, self-sacrifice and personal responsibility, he would never in a million years have considered the slimy, disreputable and pathetically transparent maneuver with which he ended his career.

No one talks enough about the damage overbearing, misandrist mothers and delinquent or weak fathers do to children, but it’s there for all to see in America’s great maladies: gangs, runaway gayness and Gender Studies. Each stem from a twisted understanding, or an absence, of responsibly channeled manliness. The reason black boys in America do so poorly, even relative to black girls, isn’t racism—otherwise you’d have to explain why boys are on the receiving end of it when girls aren’t—but the lack of dads in their lives.

Marxist feminism’s systematic expulsion of masculinity from the realm of aspirational values produces grotesque results. Feminism votes men into irrelevance and degradation, scorning fatherhood, depriving children of male role models as they unwind the protective institutions of civil society. Women have been subverting the labor market for decades, which hurts both sexes. This is particularly the case in the entertainment industry, where compensation is pegged to successful attention-seeking. That’s a girl thing: Men are supposed to compete on skill.

Jussie Smollett wanted more money, but he didn’t know how to compete for it honorably, because his understanding of the jobs marketplace was distorted by both feminism and communism. Rather than go for a big-paying movie role, or brush up his acting or singing, he decided to cast himself as a victim of oppressive forces. That’s a direct product of the communist-infused social justice milieu in which he was reared."

Feb. 28 (UPI) -- A Texas man was sentenced to 15 years in prison for firing a handgun at counter-protesters to a white supremacist rally in 2017 at the University of Florida.

Tyler Tenbrink, 30, pleaded no contest Wednesday to charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the Gainesville Sun reported.

According to Gainesville police, shortly after white nationalist Richard Spencer's appearance at a white supremacist rally was cut short due to being drowned out by protesters Oct. 19, 2017, Tenbrink and two other men traveling in a vehicle pulled up to a bus stop and began yelling ""Heil Hitler"" and other remarks at the people waiting.

A person then hit the vehicle's back window with a bat. Tenbrink then exited the vehicle after it had driven a short distance away and fired a shot at the crowd, hitting a nearby building.

Tenbrink was originally charged with attempted first-degree murder along with the firearm charge but the charges were reduced after he made a plea deal.

He was sentenced to 15 years for the aggravated assault charge and five years for the weapons charge to be served concurrently.

He is being credited with already having served 496 days in Alachua County Jail, Florida's WUFT 5 reported.

Tenbrink plans to petition the court so he can serve his time in Texas instead of Florida so he could be ""closer to my family and my children,"" he said."

""Ellen Page is engaged in pure damage control, trying to change the subject,"" Kurtz said Thursday.

""She didn't just rush to judgment on Jussie Smollett's hoax,"" he explained, ""she blamed [Vice President] Mike Pence and to a lesser extent [President] Donald Trump. She went on Stephen Colbert and said we have to connect the dots for a supposedly homophobic attack that never happened.

""Now it's fine for her to pivot to you know the reality of hate crimes, whether they deserve more coverage, I don't have any quarrel with that, but she's not expressing a smidgin of regret,"" he added.

""Ellen Page owes Mike Pence an apology for smearing him over a non-existent attack,"" Kurtz concluded.

Kurtz went on to point out that some journalists were honest enough to admit they had spoken too soon on the case, but Page had not.

""How about expressing some sort of regret for what you did?"" he said.

""She immediately went to the political,"" he continued. ""And then it turns out this never happened. In fact it was a spectacular racially-charged hoax, and she just kinda writes around that.""

Smollett initially claimed that he was beaten by two Trump supporters who doused him with bleach and placed a noose around his neck while yelling homophobic and racist slurs.

After weeks of investigating the matter, the Chicago police said that they had discovered enough evidence to charge Smollett with felony charges related to filing a false report with the police.

That evidence stemmed from their questioning of a pair of brothers who accused the actor of orchestrating a fake attack in order to garner sympathy and increase his income from the show he starred in.

Page, who is gay, has also used her position to bully actor Chris Pratt about being outspokenly supportive of the Christian faith.

Here's the video of Kurtz's scolding of Page:"

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” Schmidt said in a statement provided to TheWrap on Thursday night.

TheWrap reached out to Schmidt immediately after we received the statement to ask if the brothers — who were initially persons of interest and turned out to have both worked on “Empire” — still fully maintain their story that Smollett paid them to stage an assault in Chicago on Jan. 29. Schmidt did not respond to our question.

Reps for Smollett did not immediately return our request for comment on this story.

This case has had more twists and turns than an episode of Smollett’s Fox soap opera, “Empire.” And though Smollett is still very much involved in the real-life Chicago drama — he has a court hearing next month — the actor/singer is no longer involved in Season 5 of the TV one.

“Empire” executive producers announced last Friday that Smollett has been removed from the final two episodes of the Fox hip-hop drama’s Season 5.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” read the statement from “Empire” co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, showrunner Brett Mahoney, and executive producers Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the statement continued. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Representatives for Smollett did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the actor being dropped from the remainder of “Empire’s” fifth season.

The decision to remove Smollett — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the series — from the remaining episodes of Season 5 comes after “Empire” studio 20th Century Fox stated last Thursday it was “considering [its] options” following the news of his arrest. “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.” A day earlier, the studio had renewed its support for the actor, saying, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

During a press conference last Thursday morning, shortly after Smollett’s surrender, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that the actor staged an attack on himself because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” He also told reporters the police were in possession of a $3,500 check, which he said Smollett used to pay the brothers for the incident.

The Fox drama’s star is making around $125,000 per episode of “Empire,” an individual with knowledge told TheWrap, who added there had been no salary dispute between Smollett and the studio and that he had never even approached them about a raise.

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police early last Thursday morning, hours after he was formally charged with filing a false police report. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

The actor’s bail was set at $100,000, with Smollett required to post $10,000 (10 percent) for release. His next court date has been set for Thursday, March 14 at 11:30 a.m. Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.”

Smollett’s team put out this statement last week, after the actor was released from custody: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

The criminal case against Smollett stems from a report he filed on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

First arrested as persons of interest in the case, the Osundairo brothers were released without charges Feb. 15 following a 48-hour hold, after the police said “new evidence” had emerged and that the investigation’s “trajectory” had changed course. Earlier last week, CNN reported that Chicago police believed that Smollett might have paid the brothers to stage the attack.

A week before Smollett reported the attack, Fox received a letter threatening Smollett. In mid-February, ABC News reported that the FBI and U.S. Postal Service were looking into the possibility that Smollett had sent the threatening letter to himself, or played a role in its creation and delivery.

Along with the remarks Johnson made about Smollett’s dissatisfaction with his salary during Chicago police’s presser last week, the superintendent also said the actor sent the letter threatening to Fox himself. When Johnson first made those statements, he did not mention its source or his proof.

Minutes later, during the media conference’s Q&A portion, the police superintendent responded “yes” to a reporter who asked if that information came from Ola and Abel.

Johnson also said the following of Smollett’s photographed wounds: “So, of course, it was staged. The brothers had on gloves during the staged attack where they punched him a little bit. But as far as we can tell, the scratches and bruising that you saw on his face were most likely self-inflicted.”

In a later press conference, Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Risa Lanier detailed the prior relationship between Smollett and Abel Osundairo, saying that he was a source of “designer drugs” for Smollett and that they had been friends since late 2017. Lanier also detailed the timeline of events, including when and how Smollett convinced Abel, and later his brother, Ola, to stage an attack on him."

In a confrontation caught on video, the angry suspect punched the activist square in the face after shoving him multiple times and slapping his cell phone out of his hand. According to a spokesman for the school, police have identified the as-of-yet unnamed suspect and are seeking a “felony warrant” for his arrest.

“‘One week after the incident that received national backlash, the campus has concluded its investigation of the incident,’ said campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof in a statement released Tuesday afternoon,” student-led newspaper The Daily Californian reports.

“Based on the results of that investigation, the department is seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect,” said Mogulof. If the warrant is approved, said Mogulof, the UCPD will “immediately” take action to arrest the suspect.

As The Daily Wire has chronicled, the brutal attack on Hayden Williams, a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, has gained national attention in large part because of viral video footage of the incident (below).

While Williams (who is not a student at the school) was helping recruit for Turning Point USA at the Upper Sproul Plaza last Tuesday, two men approached the table. Apparently triggered by signs stating “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and “This is MAGA Country” — both references to the Jussie Smollett case — one of the men, wearing a black shirt, began to argue with Williams.

When the suspect’s rhetoric escalated, Williams, who is smaller in stature, began to film the conversation on his cell phone. That’s when things turned violent. The suspect began to repeatedly shove Williams, at one point threatening to “shoot” him, and then, as caught on video by a witness, sucker-punched Williams in the face before walking away.

Campus Reform, which is owned and operated by the Leadership Institute, obtained exclusive footage from Williams, which it compiled with the witness’ footage in the video below:

Daily Wire contributor and former Berkeley College Republicans president Bradley Devlin tweeted out a photo of Williams with a badly swollen eye after the attack:

My friend, Hayden, wants to thank all of you for the love and support. He’s giving you a wink, and wanted to let you know you’ll be hearing from him soon! pic.twitter.com/6kPmFZgQgz — Brad Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 21, 2019

University officials have condemned the attack and vowed to take appropriate action against the suspect.

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who tweeted out the initial footage of the incident, issued a statement last Thursday in which he decried the double standard of the media and underscored that conservative activists frequently “face threats of violence and discrimination” on college campuses.

“This assault reveals the hate and anger so many on the left harbor and that our student activists encounter on a daily basis,” said Kirk. “Our amazing grassroots organizers courageously face threats of violence and discrimination as they fight for the right for conservative voices to be heard on college campuses. I am proud of how our student activists at UC Berkeley comported themselves in what was a very scary and difficult situation. Sadly, if the roles were reversed and a conservative student wearing a MAGA hat had attacked a member of a leftist organization, the story would be a leading headline on the nightly news across all major networks. This is a hate crime pure and simple and the suspect should be held accountable.”

Drake's Dad Says He Supports R. Kelly '100 Percent' and Claims Jussie Smollett Is 'Misunderstood'

Drake‘s dad Dennis Graham is opening up about his embattled friends — R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett amid their recent scandals.

During an interview about his new single, Graham was asked about Kelly, who this week pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four alleged victims.

Telling Variety that the “Ignition” singer is “a good friend of mine,” Graham said: “I wish him the best.”

“I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.”

Graham also threw his support behind Smollett — who has been accused of staging a “bogus” attack against himself — saying the actor “has been misunderstood.”

“As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Smollett was arrested last week and is facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct. If convicted, he could serve up to three years in prison.

The Empire actor has denied the allegations and maintains his innocence.

In addition to standing by both Kelly and Smollett, Graham spoke to Variety about his new single “That on That.”

“I made it about 10 years ago. My brother and my cousin Tone Bling, we were just in my apartment. Tone came up with the track and I wrote the words to it.”

Graham’s latest track comes just as his son Drake celebrates the tenth anniversary of third mixtape So Far Gone, which propelled his music career."

Since the incident, Chicago police have seemed to suggest that Smollett falsified the police report and had actually organized the alleged attack.

This entire fiasco has done nothing but damage cultural conversations about hate crimes directed at people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals in this country. It has put groups that are at higher risk of hate crimes in a heightened state of fear that their reports will be ignored and that people will question their accuracy. If it is true that Smollett lied, as the case has not yet gone to court, then he was in the wrong, for sure. But that does not mean all hate crime reports are false or that victims should be examined more closely.

A few inconsistencies have risen up in the fallout of this situation. First, why did this story specifically get so much attention? Was it because Smollett was a celebrity? Perhaps, but celebrities have been accused of filing false reports before. Famously, Ryan Lochte, an Olympic swimmer for the U.S., alleged that he had been the victim of an armed robbery in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Olympic Games. While that story did get some headlines, it did not prompt a message from then-President Barack Obama on the topic, as President Trump has done with the Smollett case. And it certainly did not dominate news cycles for weeks on end.

So the story must have gotten so much attention because of the brutality of it, right? Again, that seems inaccurate. While the alleged attack did draw on some viciously hateful concepts, people across the country are tortured and killed in hate crimes fairly often. On Feb. 16, Indiana University graduate Mustafa Ayoub was shot and killed in Indianapolis in a hate crime based on his Muslim faith. On Jan. 6, Dana Martin, a black trans woman, was killed in her vehicle in Montgomery, Alabama, because of her gender identity. In May of 2013, Gabriel Fernandez, an 8-year-old boy, was killed by a man because he thought the boy was gay. Fernandez had his skull fractured and 12 ribs broken and was forced to eat cat feces. When Fernandez went to sleep, he was tied up, gagged and shoved into a closet for the night. Clearly, the brutality of the alleged attack is not what is driving the conversation.

If it is the combination of the falsehood, the celebrity and the use of hateful marks that is driving the interest in Smollett’s story, that can be forgiven of the public. People love a spectacle. But people need to ask themselves, honestly and truly, is this what we want our era to be known for – to laugh at someone for apparently using a horrible sign of our times in a failed attempt to elevate their own career, while people who actually experience this kind of violence every day go unheard? And then, in the ultimate insult to a society, use that one person’s poor judgement as an excuse to call them liars?

Smollett seems to have used hate as a possible avenue to fame. Do not allow him to have the final legacy of making people doubt the true victims of hate in this country.

SHOW TRANSCRIPT

""The Lighthouse is a predominantly African-American LGBT-inclusive church that welcomes all people. … We wanted a worship setting that had the black church ethos.""

""What is it that you all are trying to do here at Lighthouse?""

""We wanted a place which was unashamed and unapologetic about its rich and full and wide embrace of LGBT folks. And also we want to place that was open to all.""

News of an alleged attack against actor and musician Jussie Smollett resonated with the congregation whose members sit at the intersection of the groups most vulnerable to hate crimes: black people and queer people.

According to the most recent FBI data, more than 75 percent of reported hate crimes in 2017 were motivated either by race or sexual orientation. And regardless of what actually happened to Smollett, there are very real dangers for black queer people in Chicago and across the country. They were two of at least 26 trans women who were killed in the U.S. in 2018, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

""There are plenty of examples of violence against black bodies that are authentic.""

Crimes against transgender people can be tough to track for a number of reasons, including the possible misgendering of the victims, but Pastor Frazier says the first step to addressing these killings is clear:

""We need to lift up their names. We need to speak their names. And we need to talk about the homophobia and the racism which led to their murders in the first place.""

They do this by partnering with other organizations to better the lives of Chicago's black queer community.

For example, Lighthouse holds service inside St. Paul's United Church of Christ, a part of a predominantly white Christian denomination. This partnership allows Lighthouse to worship in a safe space while educating the surrounding community on the plight of black Chicagoans.

Here's Pastor Frazier marching alongside St. Paul's members, both bringing awareness of gun violence in Chicago. If you're looking for the intersectionality, consider this: a predominantly white church, a black queer church and an anti-violence group marching together to denounce gun violence.

""I fundamentally believe that we are stronger together.""

""I wanted this to be a place of empowerment. I wanted this to be a place where folks experience healing and reconciliation and also where folks whose journey is different than ours could also find refuge and we could work together for mutual progress."""

If we pay close attention, some of the month’s most egregious events can remind us of the history we should have learned.

AD

AD

Let’s work backward from this week, beginning with Michael Cohen’s hearing before the House Oversight Committee. The testimony of President Trump’s former lawyer was outrageous enough on its own, but one of the most eyebrow-raising scenes in the seven-hour saga centered on Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).

For the purposes of defending Trump against Cohen’s allegations of racism, Meadows brought in Lynne Patton — a black Trump appointee — to stand silently behind him while he spoke, assuming, apparently, that by virtue of having hired a black person, Trump could not be racist. When he was informed by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) that using a black woman as a prop was racist itself, Meadows melted down. He called Tlaib a racist for daring to say such a thing and pointed to his relatives of color and even his friendship with Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (who, yes, is black) as evidence that he was not racist.By the end of his rant, Meadows was nearly tearing up in defense of his not-racist honor.

It was, in a word, absurd.

AD

AD

But out of this farce comes a teachable moment, one that we can use for at least the rest of 2019. No, as Tlaib accurately pointed out, having a black friend — or even black nieces or nephews — does not absolve you of racism. Attempting to use people of color as a shield is, in fact, offensive. And relatedly, breaking down because you’re hurt by the insinuation that you might possibly have done something racially offensive suggests you care more about your feelings than about actual racism.

Of course, this is a microcosm of the state of our racial politics. But maybe now that we know better, we can do better.

Speaking of people who should know better: Justin Fairfax. Virginia’s African American lieutenant governor was a rising star in the Democratic Party and, for a while, avoided being caught up in the blackface-stravaganza that was the Virginia government this month.

AD

AD

He might have even ascended to the highest role in the state had Gov. Ralph Northam (D) agreed to step down after his face-painting history was revealed. But Fairfax, alas, was caught up in a scandal of his own: In the span of two weeks, he was accused of sexual assault by two women — one during his college years at Duke University and the other at a 2004 political convention.

Yet, rather than quietly step down himself — or even step back a bit from the spotlight while the accusations were investigated — Fairfax went on the offensive. In an impromptu speech on the floor of the Virginia legislature, he likened his experience to a lynching. “I’ve heard much about anti-lynching on the floor of this very Senate,” he said , referencing recently passed bills that expressed remorse for the real lynchings that took place in the commonwealth of Virginia. “And yet we stand here in a rush to judgment in nothing but accusations and no facts, and we are deciding we are willing to do the same thing.”

In fact, we are not.

AD

AD

There’s a tradition of famous black men, especially those accused of sexual misconduct, comparing their experience to being lynched. Bill Cosby said as much during his trial, as did R. Kelly. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas famously invoked a “high-tech lynching” during his confirmation hearing. Even Smollett allegedly topped off his attack by hanging a noose around his own neck.

This needs to stop. Lynching is a stain on our nation’s history, one of the ugliest legacies of black enslavement and disenfranchisement in the United States. To invoke it as a craven defense dishonors that history even as we are finally, through much effort, beginning to give it the acknowledgment it deserves. The court of public opinion may be harsh, but it is not as harsh as being stalked, tortured and killed for no reason at all. After the events of this deranged Black History Month, perhaps we can once and for all agree that carelessly invoking this history is a mistake.

Whatever is convulsing the country, it's not identity politics. For, blacks are not being pitted against Hispanics. Hispanics are not being sicced on Asians, and Ameri-Indians aren't being urged to attack the groups just mentioned. Rather, they're all piling on honky. Hence, anti-white politics or animus.

The ire of the multicultural multitudes is directed exclusively at whites and their putative privilege. Anti-whitism is becoming endemic and systemic.

Take ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett deceived the country and the Chicago Police Department about having fallen prey to a hate crime, which, it transpired, he had crudely orchestrated.

The Chicago Police Department superintendent expressed the requisite righteous indignation that a black man (Smollett) would desecrate symbols of black oppression in the process of framing innocent Others. (A noose had been purchased at Smollett's behest.)

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

Nobody, Superintendent Eddie Johnson included, said sorry to the accused group, whose reputation had been sullied: ""Trump supporters or white persons.""

""Trump supporters"" is indeed a proxy for ""white persons."" The conflation of ""white"" and ""Trump supporter"" was made, for one, by an anti-white, anti-Trump, professional agitator: Trevor Noah of the ""Daily Show."" Noah is neither funny nor very bright, but he is right in this instance.

Conservatives, for their part, persist in skirting the white-animus issue. The Smollett libel fit the ""progressive narrative,"" they intoned. (Overuse has made the ""narrative"" noun a bad cliché.)

It was a right vs. left matter, insisted others.

Smollett was sick in the head, came another obfuscation. What would public expiation and excuse-making be without the rotten habit of diseasing misbehavior?! His antics might still make him a big-time actor, but Smollett is a small-time crook, a common criminal of low character. To characterize immorality as disease is a corruption of traditional conservative thinking.

We have here a politicization of crime, reasoned other compromising conservatives.

Come again? What is the hate-crime category if not a politicization of crime? With the hate crime designation, we are essentially saying that a murder committed with racial malice is worse than one committed without it. Is that a normative call or a political one? I'd say the latter.

Some conservatives remarked that the Smollett affair occurred against the backdrop of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). Is TDS not a proxy for the white-hot hatred of whites?

Four minutes and 13 seconds in, a video filmed at the Washington State Evergreen College gives way to softly hissed, but deranged, diatribes by faculty. Theirs is unadulterated, anti-white agitprop. Yet the TV host who screened this pedagogic incitement chuckles lightheartedly about secondary, lesser issues like victimhood chic. Never once is the thing called what is it: incessant and dangerous incitement to hate innocent whites for their alleged pigmental privilege.

A recent and jarring anti-white incident involved the curriculum imposed on students by the Santa Barbara Unified School District. As if public education were not sufficiently corrupt, ""educators"" now contract out to an educational black op. These tax-paid mercenaries come to schools as social levelers to put your kids through an indoctrination boot camp. However, it's not egalitarianism the schools are increasingly teaching, but anti-whitism.

""Just Communities Central Coast"" (JCCC) is such an ""educational"" black op. The reported outcomes of the ""Just Communities"" initiative tell us a lot about the impetus behind the course.

""JCCC's discriminatory curriculum has led to increased racial animosity toward Caucasian teachers and students,"" reported Eric Early, a Republican candidate for California attorney general.

American kids can barely read properly or speak and write grammatically. They'll never know the wonders of the Western literary canon (banished because produced by the pale patriarchy). But they've committed to consciousness ugly, nonsensical, stupid, decontextualized grids that tabulate the ways of white oppression.

Talk about ""The Closing of the American Mind""!

Yet, the litigant, a Republican candidate for California attorney general, had a hard time coming out with it. JCCC's anti-white teachings were merely anti-American, he told Fox News apologetically. Is that all you've got, sir?

I read Esquire's Feb. 12 cover story featuring Ryan Morgan, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Fox News' Martha MacCallum called it ""provocative,"" before inviting U.S. Army veteran Darrin Porcher and activist-actor Rumando Kelley to trash ""The Life of [this] American Boy at 17.""

The only reason the humdrum story of poor Ryan Morgan was deemed ""provocative"" is because he's white. As it transpired from the disjointed ""thoughts"" disgorged by MacCallum's two black supremacist guests, ""There is [sic] more important people in the world than white middle-class."" (Ryan is not wealthy. He holds a job for which he rises at 6:30 a.m., before school. I'd put him in the working-class category.)

While the one unedifying black supremacist conceded that, ""We do need to lend some credence to what a Caucasian man goes through,"" the irate Rumando roared that, ""Esquire dropped the ball on this.""

Rumando could not quite explain why the experiences of white boys deserved to be expunged, in the era of anti-whiteness and suicide rates rising among this very cohort: white American males.

Indeed, the suicide rate is declining everywhere in the world except for America, where it is 12.8 per 100,000, ""well above China's current rate of seven."" Dubbed ""deaths of despair,"" white Americans and native Americans are the most suicidal populations in the U.S."
