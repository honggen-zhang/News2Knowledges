Tina Tchen, who worked as former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff during her time in the White House, first contacted Kim Foxx by text on Feb. 1 and said the actor's family had ""concerns"" about the investigation, according to the communications. Tchen, a Chicago-based attorney, is also the co-founder of the Times Up Legal Defense Fund.

At the time of the correspondence, Smollett was still considered by police to be the victim of an assault. The actor was later charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false report for allegedly staging an attack to make him look like the victim of a brutal hate crime.

“Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,” Foxx emailed Tchen on Feb. 1, referring to the city’s top cop, Eddie Johnson. “I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.”

Foxx also texted with one of Smollett’s relatives, whose name was redacted in copies of the communication released by her office.

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask,” Foxx wrote. “Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.”

The relative responded, “Omg this would be a huge victory.”

“I make no guarantees, but I’m trying,” Foxx replied back.

Foxx recused herself from the investigation before Smollett was charged. Her first deputy, Joe Magats, is overseeing the case.

Foxx said in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times that Smollett's family was concerned that aspects of the police investigation were being leaked to media.

“They had no doubt about the quality of the investigation, but believed that the FBI would have a tighter lid on the information,” Foxx told the outlet.

Johnson said in an interview with USA TODAY that he told Foxx he was “amenable” to conversations about having the FBI take the lead in the Smollett investigation. But ultimately, police and federal officials determined it was most appropriate that the investigation continue to be led by Chicago Police. The FBI had been providing city police with technical assistance since soon after it launched its investigation.

“I did speak to the FBI because they handle hate crimes,” Johnson said. “We had conversations about it, but at the end of the day it stayed where it should have, in my opinion.”

Tchen did not respond to a request for comment.

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts, accusing him of staging a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men near his Chicago apartment.

Police allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to bolster his profile.

He told police that two assailants beat him and threw a rope around his neck while hurling racial and anti-gay slurs at him. Smollett also told police that one of the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

Police arrested two men, brothers who knew Smollett and had worked with him on “Empire,” weeks after the incident and identified them as suspects. They later released the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, without charge.

The brothers told police that Smollett plotted the assault, gave them money to purchase supplies for the ruse and paid them $3,500 for taking part in the alleged plot.

Smollett is free on $100,000 bond. He’s scheduled to appear in court Thursday."

From the start, there have been questions about the Chicago Police Department and now it appears appears State’s Attorney Kim Foxx may have had some concerns.

The Chicago Tribune reports, Tina Tchen, former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, sent text message to Foxx saying the family had “concerns about the investigation.” The messages began Feb. 1. See below:

“Spoke to the Superintendent Johnson,” Foxx emailed Tchen back on Feb. 1. “I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.”

The same day, Foxx texted with Smollett’s relative, whose name was blacked out in copies released by her office.

“Spoke to the superintendent earlier, he made the ask,” Foxx wrote. “Trying to figure out logistics. I’ll keep you posted.”

“Omg this would be a huge victory,” the relative replied.

“I make no guarantees, but I’m trying,” Foxx wrote back.

The relative was concerned about the constant leaks coming from the Chicago Police Department. Kiera Ellis, a spokeswoman for the state’s attorney’s office, said this in a statement, “When she initially engaged in the communications, Mr. Smollett was still believed to be the victim of the crime. As the investigation started to change and it became a possibility that he could actually be a suspect, that is when she made the decision (to recuse herself).”

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case. Originally, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone, but he did give his phone records. Then the FBI reportedly said the Chicago police “overstated” their Smollett case.

Plus, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson appears to love the media. From Don Lemon to press conferences he has done to more chats with the media than Smollett. Back on Feb. 25, he flew all the way to “Good Morning America” to talk with Robin Roberts.

Last week, Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos, who also represented Colin Kaepernick, called out the Chicago Police Department.

“He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report,” Geragos said. “Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

Geragos also challenged the idea that Smollett may have staged an attack because he wanted a higher salary for his “Empire” role.

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money. They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money,” Geragos said. “They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Additionally, Geragos accused the Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool.

He also alleged that Howard and his pastor conspired to kill him because he refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Elijè filed a lawsuit and now Howard is speaking out.

According to TMZ, Elije filed a lawsuit in Georgia, which reportedly says, “Mr. Elije started receiving threats to his safety and well-being via a multitude of phone calls, text messages, communications on various social media platforms and emails, all of which were from unfamiliar or disguised sources.”

Elije is now suing for assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He is also demanding punitive damages and Howard pay for all of his legal bills.

TMZ claims Howard said, “I don’t know this person, never seen him. Any allegation said about me is false.” He also called the lawsuit a “money grab.”

In November, Masin Elijè‏, posted a series, beginning with one that said his “life was threatened after I was sexually harassed, threatened and manipulated, by someone I respected, my ex boyfriend NBA player Dwight Howard, and his camp also ‘catfished’ by his disrespectful ass PASTOR.”

The lengthy thread of tweets included purported audio proof of a conversation with Howard about him acknowledging a sexual relationship with Elijè‏. He claims they met at a “Wild’n Out” party.

And while a person’s sexual orientation isn’t newsworthy, that context was important to mention because Elijè‏ also made a similar accusation on Twitter last year against rapper Playboi Carti. As Bossip reminded readers, those claims were “allegedly discredited.”

Dwight Howard, meanwhile, remained silent, until now. The eight-time NBA All Star has been nursing a lingering gluteal injury that has kept him sidelined this season.

This is Howard’s first season with the Wizards after a 14-year career of excellence on the hard court. Conventional wisdom was that his addition to a playoff team that needed to shore up its defense was a match made in basketball heaven, but the season has thus far been a disappointment for a group with multiple all-star players on its roster.

Reportedly, Howard recently got engaged to South Carolina University star basketball Te’a Cooper.

Wohl and his colleagues, Laura Loomer and Ali Alexander, recently released a short “documentary” about their investigation into whether Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) married her younger brother to get him into the country, thereby violating immigration law. I watched the documentary (so you don’t have to) and the team offers no evidence to support their thesis.

But one scene in the documentary has drawn accusations, most notably from journalist Tony Webster, that Wohl and Alexander may have filed a false police report claiming to have received a death threat from an account created by Wohl himself.

In the right-wing ‘documentary’ on Rep. Ilhan Omar released tonight by Jacob Wohl, Laura Loomer, and Ali Alexander, they included this screenshot of a threat they received. There’s one problem: NBC News earlier reported that Jacob Wohl created the account which sent the “threat”. pic.twitter.com/phGxZJ7V3I — Tony Webster (@webster) March 13, 2019

About 12 minutes into the film, Alexander and Wohl exit a black SUV and enter a building. They’re shown talking to someone inside about alleged “threats” they received. As they’re talking, the first “threat” is displayed on the screen, from an account with a profile picture identical to that of @DrakeHomes612, an account reportedly created and managed by Wohl, according to the Daily Beast. The account allegedly belonged to “Drake Holmes,” a “Minneapolis born and raised… diversity coordinator,” according to NBC reporter Ben Collins.

The documentary shows several other threats, and it is not clear whether the one that appears to have been written by Wohl was actually included in the police report.

The Daily Beast’s Will Sommer obtained the police report and says that it mentions some tweets were provided to police but doesn’t list which ones. Loomer told Sommer she had nothing to do with the police report, but Alexander suggested that Wohl did share the questionable tweet, according to a video he posted Monday morning.

“Jacob [Wohl] may have actually violated the law, maybe,” Alexander said. “Jacob handed the paper over to the police that included a screenshot from this account – and that’s on him.”

Alexander went on to condemn Wohl for providing the wrong kind of “misinformation.”

“It confirms that he’s not operating at a level where there’s useful misinformation, but kind of stupid, vanity-filled, ego-fueled disinformation,” Alexander said in his video. “And that won’t look good for Jacob.”

The 25-minute film created by the trio consists of mostly Wohl, Loomer, and Alexander talking about Omar.

It shows Alexander eating and talking at a restaurant while Loomer stands outside Omar’s house in the snow. She rings the doorbell and knocks, trying to serve Omar with an affidavit for her to sign stating that she never married her brother.

“The lights are on,” Loomer says after a minute of footage showing her outside the door while intense music plays (the same music plays throughout the entire film, no matter how innocuous the scene). She eventually gives up.

The team also goes to what is presented as Omar’s local office, but no one answers the door or the phone. The group paints these two incidents as Omar avoiding questions or her constituents. They went to her office at 9:17 a.m., according to the film. The workers could have gotten word that they would have been coming and not answered the door. As for Omar, she could easily have been in Washington when Loomer knocked on her door.

Later, Wohl tells Alexander that they initially set out to disprove the claims against Omar, but ended up allegedly proving them.

“We brought in a camera crew, we brought in – I don’t know how many livestreams we did while we were in Minnesota,” Wohl offers as proof they took their investigation seriously.

A few minutes of the short film are dedicated to the Democrats’ refusal to specifically condemn Omar’s anti-Semitism, with clips from CSPAN.

Finally, in the last couple of minutes, the trio lays out a timeline of alleged evidence that Omar married her brother, yet none of this evidence is shown.

Snopes, certainly no friend to conservatives, rated the claim that Omar married her brother as “unproven,” and includes some pointed questions: Why would Omar need to marry her brother when siblings of U.S. residents could apply for permanent residency status? Why is there no record of the alleged brother applying for such status if that was the purpose of the fraud? Why did Omar claim Ahmed Hirsi was her husband during her 2016 campaign when she was still married to another man (her alleged brother) and not Hirsi?

There are other questions, but you get the gist.

Finally, some are asking why conservatives aren’t reacting to Wohl’s potential false report the same as they did to Jussie Smollett’s alleged fake hate crime? Two reasons:

1. The media didn’t immediately treat Wohl as a victim and spread his implausible story far and wide, and invite him on “Good Morning America” to cry about his ordeal. No one (outside of maybe a few) believed Wohl received death threats requiring the level of security he and his colleagues kept claiming while in Minnesota. Journalist Tony Webster has an excellent Twitter thread on all of this.

2. Wohl hasn’t been arrested and police haven’t provided evidence to the media that Wohl did, in fact, fake the death threats, as with the Smollett case.

Still, if it does turn out that Wohl faked even one of the threats he provided to police, it puts him on par with Smollett as one of the worst hate crime hoaxers in history."

The CSI: Miami writer said the past six weeks, during which his show's 36-year-old co-lead was charged with staging a hate crime and lying to police, has 'been an emotional rollercoaster' in an interview with Entertainment Weekly on Wednesday.

And in terms of impact to the show, 'It definitely was an unexpected wrench to have to take the character Jamal out of those final two episodes [of Season 5]' said the Executive Producer.

Grim: Jussie Smollett arrived at Cook County criminal court on Tuesday at 11am CST wearing reflective sunglasses and a gray coat amid speculation over his future on the TV hit series Empire

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

Since then he's been written off of the final episodes of the show that skyrocketed him to fame.

And Mahoney admitted that choosing to do so was a 'very difficult decision' to make.

'I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,' said the Empire boss.

As for the besieged actor's future on the show, Mahoney suggested Fox producers would let the legal process play out before making any critical decisions.

'It’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie,' he said.

'We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.'

The fifth season of Empire premieres on Wednesday and Smollett was notably absent from all of the show's promotional photos for the next chapter.

Smollett strutted into his hearing Tuesday where a judge ruled that cameras will be allowed for his arraignment this week, but it's up to the case's appointed presiding judge to determine the use of cameras for all future proceedings.

The Empire actor arrived at Cook County criminal court around 11am CST wearing reflective sunglasses and offering a slight smile.

He was not required to be there, but reportedly chose to attend the hearing to prove he intends to be an active participant in his defense. He entered with Tina Glandian, a lawyer from his attorney Mark Geragos' firm.

Judge LeRoy Martin Jr allowed for one still camera and one video camera to be present at the Alien: Covenant actor's next court appearance, which will be his arraignment on Thursday.

During Tuesday's hearing Smollett's attorney Glandian was in favor of having cameras in the courtroom saying the defense wanted the public to see what happens in court.

'In light of the substantial amount of misinformation in the case, the defense actually welcomes cameras in the courtroom,' she said as per the Chicago Tribune.

Supportive: Mahoney has previously stood behind his star on social media, as seen in a tweet from last month

Smollett is free on $100,000 bond and has another hearing scheduled for Thursday where he'll be arraigned for those 16 felony counts and where a judge will be assigned over his case.

That judge has the power to potentially reverse or modify any decision made Tuesday about cameras in the courtroom.

He is facing a maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars and fines of up to $400,000."

Foxx tells the Sun-Times the relative expressed concerns over leaked information that media outlets attributed to “police sources.”

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the FBI was involved from the start but there was never talk of turning the case over.

Smollett was charged with 16 felony counts related to his claim that he was the victim of a brutal hate crime at the hands of “racist” supporters of President Trump in Chicago early in the morning of January 29.

After a thorough investigation, police declared it a hoax, and that Smollett hired two brothers of Nigerian descent, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, to carry out the fake attack.

Smollett denied the claims.

Mahoney tells Entertainment Weekly that the last two months have been “an emotional rollercoaster.“

“You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season…” he said. “So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong.”

In regards to Smollett being written out of the final two episodes of the series, Mahoney says it was a “difficult decision,” but one they were able to make work because of the “strong ensemble” and available stories to tell.

“Allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,” he added.



Mahoney says it’s still “too early” for anyone to think about the show without Smollett, so for now, he’s “trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out.”

However, in response to the rumors that Empire will be cancelled because of the controversy, the Emprie exec says he’s “confident” there will be another season.

Empire returns Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on Fox."

While speaking to EW in a recent interview, Mahoney commented on how the show handled reworking the last few episodes of the season with Smollett being written out.

""It definitely was an unexpected wrench to have to take the character Jamal out of those final two episodes, just because he is an important part of the show. But, luckily, we have such a strong ensemble and so many stories to tell,"" he said.

""So often when you get towards the end of the season, I have so much story to tell that sometimes having to take something out means having room for something else that I’m just as passionate about, so we were able to make that work,"" Mahoney went on to say.

He also acknowledged how complicated the whole situation was after discovering that Smollett was suspected and then later charged for fabricating the hate-crime attack he claimed to have suffered in January.

""It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,"" Mahoney explained.

The Empire EP addressed the notion that Smollett could be fired from the show for good.

""It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there,"" he stated. ""And it’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie. We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.""

Smollett is currently facing 16 felony counts of lying to the police about the assault. The allegations are specifically referred to as “false report of offense,"" and are defined as Class 4 felonies.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” Smollett's indictment read in part. He is due back on court Thursday."

It’s been an emotional rollercoaster. You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season, which are also just heightened emotionally. So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong.

I’m confident about it. I know that the network and studio is really happy with what we’ve done creatively this season. I’m not surprised that we don’t necessarily have a pick up at this point as I think last season we waited until May. All the indications I have are that we will be.

Mar 13, 2019 • Post A Comment

The Fox drama series “Empire,” which has been in the headlines because of what began as an apparent hate crime against actor Jussie Smollett and has since become a major controversy surrounding Smollett, returns tonight for the second half of its 18-episode season, with Brian Lowry writing in a piece for CNN that the Smollett situation clouds the future of the show.

The show’s return comes the same week that Smollett appeared in court after being hit with a 16-count felony indictment for allegedly filing a false police report in connection with what is now widely believed to be an attack that was staged by the actor. Smollett has denied the charges.

“The network has already announced that the actor will be left out of the last two episodes to ‘avoid further disruption on set,’ although it’s unclear how his absence will be explained,” Lowry writes. “That means the seventh hour in this latest run could wind up being his character’s last on the series. The program has yet to be renewed for next season, a decision Fox won’t have to officially make until May.”

Smollett plays Jamal on the series, and Lowry notes that “Jamal is a major character and has a significant storyline as these new episodes get under way. His relationship with Kai (Toby Onwumere) has placed him between the journalist and his family, in what amounts to a test of his loyalties.”

The report notes that “Empire,” even though it has fallen off in viewership since its early days as a breakout hit, “remains Fox’s second-most-watched drama in key demographics. Per Nielsen data, same-day ratings averaged about 5 million viewers through the first half of the season, which ended in December.”"

Season 5 left off with the Lyons starting their own managing and entertainment agency. While at their LFM showcase they were offered Empire back. Cookie revealed she sold the condo so the family can have their own record label as well. It was all too much to be true.

Kingsley, looking battered, crashed the showcase and revealed that Lucious is actually his father. He and Andre got in a fight, which ends with Andre flat-lining in the hospital.

There has been just as much drama off camera during Empire‘s hiatus than the first half of this season.

Jussie Smollett, an actor on the show, was charged with 16 felonies for filing a false police report for an alleged hate crime. His future on the show is unknown, but the drama on Empire will continue.

When viewers last caught up with Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), Lucious (Terrence Howard) and the other members of the Lyon family, the family drama had reached a breaking point.

Jamal (Smollett) and his new fiancé Kai (Toby Onwumere) were dealing with some relationship issues; Andrew (Trai Byers) was seen flattening in the ER in a flash forward as the mystery of who is supposed to die in the future looms; Lucious and Cookie's return to control Empire was closer to become a reality, though he and Becky (Gabourey Sidibe) were accedes of data mining.

And to top it all, Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) broke the news to the Lyons, and the world, that he is Lucious's illegitimate son.

While the series will have a lot of drama on the screen to deal for the rest of the season, behind the scenes writers were forced to scramble and change the outcome of Season 5 after Smollet was charged with allegedly faking a hate crime at the end of January.

Ahead of the midseason premiere, Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney revealed what is next for Smollett's character Jamal in the seven episodes he will be appearing in before bowing out for the last two installments of the season.

""That's going to be a struggle for [Jamal and Kai] in the back half of the season. Whereas they had this idyllic life in London, now they're here in New York and Jamal is back with his family and what does it mean for Jamal to be a Lyon?"" Mahoney told Entertainment Weekly. ""And is Jamal tired of apologizing for being a Lyon? And is it going to be up to Kai to either accept him or will they have to go their different ways?

""And for Kai, he's going to get a real glimpse of what it actually means to be a Lyon, and he has to make a decision for himself if he wants to be associated with the family,"" he continued.

As for the twist of his new brother? Mahoney teased Jamal may not be as welcoming of Kingsley given his vindictive actions in the past.

""What you have to think about regarding Jamal is that Jamal is fiercely loyal to the Lyon family and he feels that Lucious has done him wrong — and yet he's still loyal to Lucious,"" Mahoney told the outlet. ""So despite this kid Kingsley believing he’s been treated badly by Lucious, Jamal doesn't really feel that’s justification for what Kingsley has done.""

FOX and show producers have continued to express their support for the Smollett, though after he was charged they made the decision to write him out of the final two episodes of Empire Season 5. However, that does not mean the actor will not return for Season 6, should FOX renew the series.

Empire returns Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on FOX."

Joseph Alcoff, a leader of the Antifa group Smash Racism D.C. (the group that maliciously stormed Tucker Carlson’s residence and harassed Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife out of a D.C. restaurant) was arrested recently in Philadelphia for aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. This is not Alcoff's first offense; he has a long history of violence. So it should surprises some to know that while he was leading a militant organization, he was also doubling as the spokesperson for Americans for Financial Reform (AFR).

Alcoff served as the communications director at the notoriously left leaning AFR. During his tenure at the organization, Alcoff aided in multiple congressional Democratic press conferences and was even a guest on the House Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee podcast, where he criticized the state of the CFPB under the Trump Administration. Alcoff also released a statement regarding the Stopping Abuse and Fraud in Electronic (SAFE) Lending Act, which attempted to bolster regulations on Payday lenders.

Alcoff’s attempts to target Payday lending did not stop there. He personally met with former CFPB Director Richard Cordray and other CFPB senior staff on three separate occasions in 2016 and 2017, during the height of the Payday regulation debates.

All the while Alcoff continued to make threats against political leaders, commit violence against innocent bystanders, and regularly call for the overthrow of capitalism on his social media channels. Somehow, these attacks on many Trump supporters never made the news until recently, unlike the recent Jussie Smollett’s alleged hoax anti-gay hate crime that outwardly accused Trump supporters of hate crimes without any real evidence.

Fortunately, AFR publicly stated that Alcoff is no longer with the organization, and his work in drafting policies and regulations with the potential to harm millions of consumers and small businesses is slowly unraveling. The CFPB announced earlier in February that the bureau is implementing a plan to rescind the harmful Payday loan regulations that were created with Alcoff’s assistance.

Eliminating these regulations as part of “Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans” is a win for both consumers and small businesses. These regulations would have most certainly decimated the entire Payday loan industry, hurting thousands of individuals who rely on short-term loans.

Contrary to the Alcoff’s beliefs that Payday loans merely force “Americans [into] a cycle of debt,” the loans are remarkably simple. Borrowers must prove they have an active income, a checking account, a government-issued ID, and only then can they obtain a short-term loan for a nominal fee of roughly $15 for every $100 borrowed.

Alcoff’s intentions to destroy the Payday loan industry could have forced a family to choose between paying bills and putting food on the table. One survey found that nearly 60 percent of Americans do not have enough cash to cover an unexpected $500 expense. Payday loans prevent borrowers who have taken a financial hit into choosing between two necessities. Rather, they have the ability to cover both with access to simple short-term loan options.

Alcoff’s successful infiltration of a government agency that could have wiped out an entire industry should infuriate policymakers and the public alike. His public agenda to end Payday loans while secretly leading an organization that is known for its extreme violence should make both Democrats and Republicans question their allegiance to AFR, which propped Alcoff up as its spokesperson. Violent extremists should not get to dictate policies that affect every day Americans. Luckily, with Alcoff's influence out of the picture, it looks like the CFPB is back on the right track."

Just days after Jussie Smollett told Chicago police he had fought off a pair of attackers who targeted him in an apparent hate crime, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx tried to persuade Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to turn the investigation over to the FBI.

Foxx's call to Johnson came after an influential supporter of the ""Empire"" actor reached out to Foxx personally: Tina Tchen, a Chicago attorney and former chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama, according to emails and text messages provided by Foxx to the Chicago Sun-Times in response to a public records request.

Tchen passed Foxx's number to a relative of the actor, and the ensuing conversations with the family member was cited by Foxx last month as the reason she recused herself from Smollett's prosecution as the actor faces disorderly conduct charges for allegedly making a false police report.

Text messages show Tchen contacted Foxx on Feb. 1, three days after Smollett said he was jumped by two men as he walked home from a sandwich shop near his Streeterville home. Tchen texted Foxx to set up an early morning phone call.

""I wanted to give you a call on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know. They have concerns about the investigation,"" Tchen wrote in a text sent before 5 a.m., seeking to set up a call with Foxx before Tchen left on an 8 a.m. flight to New York.

A few hours later, Foxx received a text from a relative of Smollett, who said she'd received the number from Tchen.

Jussie Smollett‘s future on Empire remains to be seen.

Ahead of the show’s midseason premiere on Wednesday, showrunner Brett Mahoney admitted that while it had to be done, it was a “very difficult decision.”

“I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make,” Mahoney told Entertainment Weekly.

In terms of rewriting the show, Mahoney said while removing Smollett’s Jamal Lyon from the final two episodes wasn’t easy, it gave room for other storylines.

“It definitely was an unexpected wrench to have to take the character Jamal out of those final two episodes, just because he is an important part of the show,” he said. “But, luckily, we have such a strong ensemble and so many stories to tell. So often when you get towards the end of the season, I have so much story to tell that sometimes having to take something out means having room for something else that I’m just as passionate about, so we were able to make that work.”

As for how the cast and crew has reacted to the scandal, Mahoney admitted it has been an “emotional roller coaster.”

“You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season, which are also just heightened emotionally,” he said. “So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong.”

Mahoney also said they haven’t made any decisions regarding Smollett’s future on the show as they await the legal process to play out.

“It’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie,” he said. “We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.”"

The right-wing Twitter troll and Trump fanboy was in Minneapolis with fellow provocateur Laura Loomer last month, filming a series of ""documentary"" videos trying to prove a debunked conspiracy theory that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) married her own brother, The Daily Beast reports. He portrayed himself as being in grave danger during the trip, often wearing a bulletproof vest, and in the latest video he filmed himself reporting alleged death threats at a Minneapolis police station.

One of the supposed threats was a Twitter DM from the account @Drakehomes612, describing himself as a Minneapolis ""diversity coordinator"" with a photo of a Hispanic man and a rainbow flag emoji in the profile. ""I hope you fuckin know that if [I] bump into you in Dinkytown or anywhere else in my city I'm going shoot you and shit on your fucking bodies,"" the message read. ""Get that fuck out my city you piece of shit. Now.""

But as was widely reported last month, that account was one of several ""sockpuppet"" accounts that Wohl created to stir up fake controversies online. He was banned from Twitter after bragging to USA Today about his plans to create more fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook, which he would use to manipulate the 2020 election. He later claimed that the ban was good for him, saying, ""Jacob Wohl is the number-one trending topic on Twitter right now.""

The Daily Beast reports that it's not yet clear if Wohl actually reported the fake threats to the Minneapolis police, but a police report describes Wohl as giving police some printed tweets as evidence.

Activist Ali Alexander, who organized Wohl's trip to Minneapolis and went with him to the police station, has now distanced himself from the situation, saying Wohl may be a ""bad actor"" peddling ""stupid, vanity-filled, ego-fueled disinformation.""

Readers on Twitter were quick to draw parallels between Wohl and Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who is due in court tomorrow over charges that he staged a racist, homophobic hate crime in Chicago in an attempt to boost his career.

Jacob Wohl reported a death threat to the police that he wrote to himself from a fake Twitter account.

It was previously reported that Jussie Smollett made a $3,500 check to two Nigerian brothers to stage his hate crime attack, but now the pair have confirmed the check was for a training program.



According to TMZ, the $3,500 check made out to Abel Osundairo, 25, and his brother Ola Osundairo, 27, who are bodybuilders was for training to prepare the former Empire actor for an upcoming music video shoot.



Abel and Ola's attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told TMZ the $3,500 check was compensation for a training and nutrition program designed to help Smollett bulk up for a music video.



Schmidt denied a reporter's suggestion that the brothers could be in legal jeopardy if they lied to police about the check.



""Absolutely not,"" Schmidt said. ""I don't know what the prosecutors have said or not said, but I know in terms of their legal analysis, they're not in any peril.""



She said Smollett ""took advantage"" of the Osundairo brothers. ""What this case really is about is a person in a position of trust who really betrayed my clients and took advantage of them.""



The Empire star had told police that two Trump supporters attacked him and yelled racist and homophobic slurs while pouring bleach on him and tying a rope around his neck outside his condo on Jan. 29.



The 36-year-old was arrested on Feb. 20 and charged with one felony count of lying to the police. He also faces federal charges of mailing a threatening letter to himself.



Chicago PD Superintendent, Eddie Johnson accused the actor of paying the brothers $3,500 to help him stage the attack. They told police Smollett promised to pay them an additional $500 when they returned from a trip to Africa.



Jussie Smollett is due back in court on March 14.

Smollett Team: Court Cameras Would Show State’s Flimsy Case

CHICAGO—A lawyer for Jussie Smollett said Tuesday, March 12, that she would welcome cameras in the courtroom during the “Empire” actor’s trial on charges accusing him of lying to the police, saying there has been a lot of leaked misinformation and cameras would allow the public to “see the evidence and the lack thereof.”

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for March 14. During that hearing, the case will be assigned to a trial judge who will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

With regards to his acting abilities, this will be his finest hour! https://t.co/LrsYQjYS51 #tcot #maga — Chris Krok (@chriskrokshow) March 12, 2019

During the hearing, which was held after local news organizations requested that cameras be allowed in the courtroom, Judge LeRoy Martin, Jr. said that the new judge will decide whether or not to allow cameras in the courtroom during subsequent hearings and the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is “demonstrably false.”

“We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” she said.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct—the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police—because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

Smollett’s attorneys have called 16 counts “prosecutorial overkill.” The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence.

Robin Roberts Said Jussie Smollett Interview Was a ‘No Win,’ Hesitated to Do It

ABC reporter Robin Roberts said that the interview she conducted with “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett regarding an alleged attack against him was a “no win.”

Roberts admitted on March 4 that she initially resisted doing the interview because Smollett’s story—that he was assaulted by two white men in downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures and that he held onto his Subway sandwich—didn’t seem to be real.

Smollett also claimed that one of the alleged attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” in an apparent reference to “Make America Great Again,” a slogan of President Donald Trump and his supporters.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” Roberts told the crowd at an event in New York City on Monday, reported the New York Post. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts, 58, said she was promised she could challenge Smollett, 36, on the “red flags” in his story. She finally relented.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,” she said.

The subsequent interview was slammed by many as soft, with Roberts seemingly attempting to cast Smollett in a favorable light. It didn’t help that two days after the interview, when it aired, Chicago police arrested two Nigerian-American brothers who detectives said later revealed that Smollett orchestrated the attack, making it a hate crime hoax.

Roberts said she was cognizant of identity politics—with both her and the actor being black and gay—and knew she would be criticized by people who thought she wasn’t hard enough on Smollett while also facing questions from those supporting the actor.

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she said. At the time, since Smollett was still considered a victim, she framed her questions to acknowledge that context.

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do,” she said.

After the brothers were arrested, ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams said during a “Good Morning America” segment that comments Smollett made during the interview with Roberts could be used against him if the story does indeed turn out to be false.

Among them was Smollett’s confidence that the two people seen in surveillance footage walking near the scene of the alleged attack about 30 minutes before it reportedly took place were the same people that attacked him.

“In that interview, [Smollett] specifically says, ‘Yeah, those two guys on the surveillance footage, those are the guys that attacked me,’ so now he’s sort of boxed in,” Abrams said.

Police identified the two people as the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, supporting the case that they were the attackers. When they informed police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the alleged hoax, officials began looking at Smollett as a suspect.

The actor was eventually arrested on Feb. 21 for filing a false police report.

In a statement in March, the brothers said they regretted helping Smollett perpetrate the alleged attack.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, in a statement obtained by CBS Chicago.

Previously, the Osundairos, who met Smollett while acting on “Empire” and one of whom became the actor’s personal trainer, said in a statement that they’re not racist.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they said on Feb. 18.

“In due course, all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible,” added the brothers’ attorney, Schmidt.

While Empire decided to cut Smollett from the last two episodes of the season (which were still in production as the scandal unfolded), Smollett, who plays openly gay R&B star Jamal Lyon, will appear in the first seven episodes as per usual.

According to showrunner Brett Mahoney, Wednesday’s episode will pick up with Jamal and his fiancé, Kai (Toby Onwumere), still finding their place in the tempestuous Lyon family. “That’s going to be a struggle for them in the back half of the season,” Mahoney told Entertainment Weekly. “What does it mean for Jamal to be a Lyon? And is Jamal tired of apologizing for being a Lyon? And is it going to be up to Kai to either accept him or will they have to go their different ways?” In the last two episodes of the season, Jamal will be “out of the country.”

But questions are also swirling about how Smollett’s offscreen controversy will impact the fate of the show, which has yet to be renewed for a sixth season. Will the Smollett drama impact ratings, which were were already down 15 percent this season? And, even if the show is renewed, will Smollett still have a place in it? Mahoney seemed to indicate that Smollett’s future may depend on how his criminal case plays out. The actor is currently out on $100,000 bail.

“It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there,” Mahoney said. “It’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie. We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.”"

Empire returns with new episodes on Fox tonight following its season 5 winter hiatus. Although the series hasn’t aired new episodes since December 2018, the show has been in the media due to star Jussie Smollett’s indictment. There are 9 episodes remaining in season 5.

The description for tonight’s episode 10, entitled “My Fault Is Past,” reads “With the control of Empire within reach again, the Lyons must pull out all the stops to prove Lucious and Becky’s innocence in the data mining scandal; Cookie struggles with Lucious’ past.

Entertainment Weekly interviewed Brett Mahoney, who gave some insight into what fans should expect with the Season 5 Winter Premiere. He said that at the start of episode 10, “We literally pick up in real time after the bomb that Kingsley dropped on the family. It’s Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) pulling Lucious aside and confronting him, and then them deciding how they need to proceed together. Cookie tells Lucious, if we have to take Kingsley down, that’s what we’re going to do to protect our family and the empire. She asks if Lucious is down for that and he says that he is.” Mahoney does tease, however, that Lucious will struggle with how to handle Kingsley and vice versa, saying “Kingsley needs to question everything he’s learned growing up, and now Lucious has to reach out to this man whose been made his enemy, when it’s actually someone who he could love and embrace.”

A sneak peek shows that Lucious and Kingsley have a confrontation during episode 10; Kinglsey has been set up as a major source of conflict for the Lyon family in the back half of this season. The sneak peek also indicates that the second half of the season will return to the cliffhanger flash forward of Andre in the hospital. During the clip, Gabourey Sidibe (who plays Becky) says she thinks Andre is “probably gonna die” because he flat-lined. Since there will be no more flash-forwards in the second half of the season, expect not to know Andre’s fate until the season finale.

As for Jussie Smollett’s character, Jamal, although Smollett was removed from filming the last two episodes of the season, his character will appear in the next 7 (which were shot before his indictment). Of Jamal and Kai’s storyline and where it left off before the hiatus, Mahoney said that “Whereas they had this idyllic life in London, now they’re here in New York and Jamal is back with his family and what does it mean for Jamal to be a Lyon? And is Jamal tired of apologizing for being a Lyon? And is it going to be up to Kai to either accept him or will they have to go their different ways? And for Kai, he’s going to get a real glimpse of what it actually means to be a Lyon, and he has to make a decision for himself if he wants to be associated with the family.”

According to IMDB , Michael Goi directed the winter premiere episode.

As previously reported, embattled star Jussie Smollett will not appear in the final two episodes of the season. The studio behind the show, 20th Century Fox, stated that the decision was made in the hopes of avoiding further disruption on the set. But according to reports, as his legal troubles mount, including his recent indictment on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, Smollett may not appear on Empire in the future either.

According to sources who spoke to Variety, there is a possibility that Fox may decide to axe the character of Jamal Lyon altogether.

As the Variety report reads, “Many options are on the table regarding Smollett and his character, Jamal Lyon.” Sources said it “is possible the character could be killed off or the role could be recast.”

Variety also pointed out that promotional clips for the second part of the season feature “fleeting glimpses of Jamal,” despite the fact that before Smollett’s scandal, his character’s engagement was a huge part of the storyline in the first half of Season 5.

Fox did say in February that they were “evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”

When those behind the show, including Lee Daniels and co-creator Danny Strong put out the statement announcing their decision about Smollett’s appearances in the final episodes of the season, they were still supporting him and were hoping justice would be served — for whomever was truly wronged.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and care about him deeply,” the statement read. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett hasn’t hasn’t said much since his claims of being assaulted by two masked men on a cold Chicago morning were turned upside down by police and the men involved in the attack, the Osundairo brothers. However, he went to court on Tuesday in Chicago for a hearing, and appeared confident in front of cameras. The 36-year-old actor, along with his legal team, has maintained his innocence. As he said in his controversial Good Morning America interview with Robin Roberts, this situation isn’t something he would make up just because.

“I’m an advocate,” he said. “I respect, too much, the people who have been attacked in any way. You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”"

It is typically used to indicate an impressive entrance or a dramatic announcement.

I have to weigh in on the issue of Mr. Francisco “Kit” Tatad’s tirades after leaving The Manila Times. I have had high respect for his credentials as a seasoned journalist all these years. But it was tough to ignore his tongue-lashing of the paper where we both scribble our thoughts on issues.







This is to inform my readers that ever since I wrote for this paper, never did I hear anything from Chairman Emeritus Dr. Dante Ang or even the slightest twitch of a nose or a wink of an eye to influence what I write. I think this trait of “walang pakialam” augurs well for even handling or editorial soundness for any media outlet as well.

An immediate fact-check will reveal the length of his stint with this paper. It means that he encountered no interference at all nor an attempt was made to “garble” his messaging. Add to this being consistently placed in the front page, which not many of us columnists enjoy or have the privilege of being honored.

Why this exit fanfare? To blame the owner or the driver of the bus for his outrage of another bus is unheard of, if logic is still the main motor of our cerebral reflexes. Contemptuously burning the bus he rode also burns the passengers riding with him. As many will advise, just get off the bus, pour a gallon of any fossil fuel on yourself and enjoy the flame.

Even the whole organization, including us, led by an equally sharp and capable CEO of TMT Dante Francis “Klink” Ang 2nd seems to be “criminalized” with such accusation of press freedom curtailment.

Mr. Kit, it’s not about the country’s oldest paper. It is not about PRRD. It is not even about journalism as we all know. I am beginning to surmise that it is all about you. I will not stay a second more if I dislike my present abode and will choose to pack my bag and search for a place where I can breathe a whiff of fresher air.

Any media platform will not tolerate distortions just attributed to “reliable and credible” sources. The excuse is old hat. Just like building a wall around gossip topped by a barb wire of “presumption” and “speculation.” It is the right of the publication to remove that peripheral impression of publishing unfounded facts.

I firmly believe that The Manila Times, unlike other media superstores that dwell on controversial topics to increase patronage or following, is quite basic — plain and simple quest for information. We are all here not to complicate things but to deliver unadulterated truth in the purest possible way. We do not process news. We deliver it as a raw image, no photoshopping, and let you decide the story’s merits.

This is a quite bothersome development. Actor Jussie Smollett was accused of paying accomplices thousands of dollars to beat him to stage a racist attack to promote his career. He succeeded. He is now facing an indictment for felony. It could be an “infamous” outcome for his quest.

Lito Lapid is suddenly enjoying his “Probinsyano” popularity. Landing in the top five of both senatorial surveys, it confirms that Philippine politics is all about actors trying to be politicians and politicians trying to be actors. Parental guidance is advised.

A DFA consular staff was removed from his post because of his behavior of disrespecting a journalist with polio. I guess he is limping by now.

We can learn a thing or two from our recent visitor, Mahathir Mohamad. But he can also learn a lot from us.

He intimated the danger of borrowing from China. He should bear in mind that those transactions were made by his own protégé Najib Razak. Borrowing money from the US of A is not that different. The stick is humongous compared to the carrot.

What I like about his statement is the warning not to borrow what you cannot afford to pay. I also would advise the government to heed his warning on immigrants. We have more than enough workers leaving for work overseas like China, so why accept immigrants from the same place.

This is what I like best: On the topic of ICC — “I think he has the right to decide on his own according to what he perceives is happening in the Philippines, as well as the rest of the world,” the Malaysian prime minister said.

* * *

Election is just like the number coding scheme: We can fire “odd” officials in the government service so we taxpayers can get “even.”

* * *

President Rodrigo Duterte said he opposed the legalization of use of marijuana for medical purposes. It is a “downer” move to those who were excited. It is just like dropping “get-well-soon” cards from a plane. Forget naming your future daughter “Mary Jane.”

* * *

Good work, good deeds and good faith to all."

She said they should take a seat next to Jussie Smollett.

UPDATE: Lori Loughlin appeared in a Los Angeles federal courtroom on March 13 where Judge Steve Kim set her bail at $1,000,000 on the conspiracy to commit mail fraud charges related to the college bribery scheme, per our sister site Variety. Her husband Mossimo Giannulli, who is also charged in the case received the same bail amount. The couple made bail by securing home and other assets as bond. Judge Kim reluctantly allowed Lori to her keep her passport and has permitted her to travel to Canada after Lori’s attorney argued she has committed to film projects in Vancouver in April and May, as well as a series set to begin in July. Judge Kim is allowing her to travel there only as long as the court is made aware of her destinations and lengths of her stays.

UPDATE 2: As the college admissions bribery scandal unfolded on March 12, Lori’s 19-year-old daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli spent the night aboard the yacht of the Chairman of USC’s Board of Trustees Rick Caruso in the Bahamas per TMZ. She is friends with the LA billionaire’s daughter Gianna and was there with pals for spring break. “My daughter and a group of students left for spring break prior to the government’s announcement yesterday. Once we became aware of the investigation, the young woman decided it would be in her best interests to return home,” Caruso told the site about Olivia. He stressed that it is not up to him but USC’s president as to what the YouTube star’s fate with the University is following the bribery scandal.

Wendy Williams, 54, kicked off “Hot Topics” on March 13 with a fiery response to “Operation Varsity Blues”, a plot, in which is being called the largest college admissions scam in history. She declared that actresses Lori Loughlin, 54, and Felicity Huffman, 56, — two of the 50 people who were charged in a nationwide college admissions bribery and cheating scam — should be “locked up.” The talk show host expressed her “disgust” over Loughlin and Huffman’s actions, and even admitted that she believes their children were in on it.

“The rest of us struggle while the rich continue to take advantage of us,” Wendy said as she began her show. “Lock em’ all up! … It’s disgusting, horrible. I feel like all of the parents should be charged and go to jail and pay huge fines. I feel like the kids will be next to be charged. I think that all these kids knew exactly what was going on… How dare they!”

Wendy went on: “Lori Loughlin, she and her husband are the worst of the lot so far. ‘Full House’, what’s going to happen to Fuller House’? Do you cancel the show because she’s a liar? I wouldn’t mind! I mean, this is terrible… Felicity Huffman is the lesser of the two evils, so they say… Who’s going to be friends with these liars now? Who’s going to be friends with their kids? … For you kids who were cheating and lying, get ready.” Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, 55, share two daughters together, Olivia, 19, and Isabella, 20. Huffman and her husband, actor William H. Macy, 69, have two daughters together, Sofia, 18, and Georgia, 16.

“They’re going to have to have several seats next to Jussie Smollett!”, Wendy added. You know it’s bad when a diss about you is included in the same sentence as Jussie Smollett. As previously reported, the actor, 36, who has since been removed from his role on Empire, was charged with filing a false report for allegedly staging a January 29 attack on himself, making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett has since denied the charge and was released on $100,000 bail in Chicago on February 21. His next hearing is set for March 14.

Since news of the scandal broke on March 12, Loughlin has surrendered to Federal authorities. The Fuller House star was taken into custody on Wednesday, March 13, after FBI agents reportedly showed up to her LA home the day prior. However, she wasn’t home due to filming on location in Vancouver.

In court documents obtained by HollywoodLife, prosecutors allege that Loughlin and her husband “agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC.”

Meanwhile, Huffman has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The actress “made a purported charitable contribution of $15,000 … to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter,” according to the 200-page legal documents. The documents include transcribed phone conversations between Huffman and one of the ‘cooperating witnesses’, who participated the scheme.

Athletic coaches from Yale, Stanford, USC, Wake Forest and Georgetown, among others, are implicated, as well as parents and exam administrators. Those who were indicted allegedly paid bribes of up to $6 million to get their children into elite colleges."

Back in February, Smollett was charged with 16 felony indictments, including filing a false police report, after allegedly staging a fake hate crime.

On Tuesday, January 29, Smollett reported to the Chicago Police Department that he was attacked by two men in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood.

Additionally, Smollett — who is openly gay — claimed that his attackers put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him, and yelled “this is MAGA country” as they fled the scene, prompting police to initially investigate the incident as a hate crime.

However, following an extensive investigation, the Chicago Police Department would eventually determine that Smollett himself orchestrated the attack, allegedly paying two American-Nigerian brothers to stage the assault.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said to reporters that Smollett’s intent was to further promote and advance his career as he was reportedly unhappy with his salary.

“Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said.

As a result of his charges, Smollett’s character was removed from the final two episodes of Empire‘s fifth season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” co-creators Lee Daniels and Brett Mahoney said in a statement to Fox News.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement continued.

However, because tonight’s episode — “My Fault is Past” — was shot before the controversy, Smollett’s character is likely to appear, as he has appeared in every single episode of the show so far.

The midseason premiere of Empire will air on Fox on Wednesday, March 13, at 8 p.m. EST."

It’s been over three months since the last Empire episode aired, even if that seems impossible considering how much the show has been in the news over the last six weeks. But Fox’s hit series returns Wednesday with its midseason premiere, the first of season 5’s final nine episodes.

To catch you up on where we left the Lyon family: Jamal (Jussie Smollett) and fiancé Kai (Toby Onwumere) are on the rocks; Andre (Trai Byers) was flatlining in a flash forward; a return to Empire was within grasp; Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Becky (Gabourey Sidibe) were accused of data mining; and Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) announced to the Lyons — and the world — that he’s Lucious’ illegitimate son.

But since the drama-filled December finale, Empire has been rocked offscreen by the allegations against star Jussie Smollett, who has been charged with filing a false police report stemming from what initially appeared to be a racial and homophobic attack against the 36-year-old actor. Fox and the creative team have continued to support Smollett amid his legal issues, but still ultimately made the decision to have him and his character, Jamal, sit out the season’s final two episodes (he will appear in the seven that were already filmed).

Ahead of Empire‘s return, Brett Mahoney exclusively chatted with EW, talking publicly for the first time about what Smollett’s situation has meant to the show, the future of the series, and the “compelling” episodes set to come.

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What have the last six weeks or so been like for you and the show?

BRETT MAHONEY: It’s been an emotional rollercoaster. You have someone in your family who’s going through this, while at the same time, we’re shooting the final episodes of the season, which are also just heightened emotionally. So it was a lot to deal with and a lot to go through, but we’re really just focused on finishing strong. We’re in our last week of production and I’m really proud of the work we’ve done this season, and hopefully the fans will really engage with these back nine episodes.

You’re on set as we speak, so what’s the mood been like? Are you all just trying to ignore the outside noise and make the best product possible?

That’s absolutely it. Of course, I can’t say that people aren’t thinking about what’s going on around them and what’s in the news and what’s happening with Jussie, but the cast and crew are all professionals and really just focused on finishing strong.

There’s been so much speculation and reporting and maybe even some misreporting about everything going on with the show, so is there anything you’d like to specifically clarify or share?

I do feel like there’s been a lot of rumors and people spreading things and different information that is out there, and much of that I don’t really see in my day-to-day. I think the cast and crew is really just focused on working and everyone feels good about the work we’re doing, and we’re hoping that we can be judged on that work. Everyone is really focused on getting these episodes done, despite everything that is going on around us. Also, I don’t really see it as something that is dividing people, more like bringing people together, bringing the cast and crew together in terms of let’s get this done.

Speaking of getting done, you had to rework the end of the season to account for Jussie not being a part of the final two episodes, so what did that do what you already had planned and what kind of rewriting did you have to do?

It definitely was an unexpected wrench to have to take the character Jamal out of those final two episodes, just because he is an important part of the show. But, luckily, we have such a strong ensemble and so many stories to tell. So often when you get towards the end of the season, I have so much story to tell that sometimes having to take something out means having room for something else that I’m just as passionate about, so we were able to make that work.

You all were put in a tough position and there were a lot of factors at play, but did removing Jussie from the final two episodes feel the like only option you could take?

It was a very difficult decision, but I think in terms of allowing the cast and the crew to really get the work done without a great deal of disruption in terms of the day-to-day and the stress of the day-to-day, and, in addition, allowing Jussie the time to really deal with what he’s been confronted with and allow him the time to focus and prepare his case, this seems like the logical decision to make.

Where does all of this stand now? Are you just in wait and see mode in terms of Jussie’s Empire future or have you thought about the possibility of the show moving forward without him?

It’s a matter of trusting the process and allowing the legal process to play out and see where it goes from there. And it’s too early to think about what we would have to do if we didn’t have Jussie. We have such a strong ensemble and we have so many stories to tell for all of these fascinating characters that it’s bigger than one character, but it’s too early to think about the show without him.

Moving on to what we can expect with the show’s return, where are we picking up at the beginning of the midseason premiere?

We literally pick up in real time after the bomb that Kingsley dropped on the family. It’s Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) pulling Lucious aside and confronting him, and then them deciding how they need to proceed together. Cookie tells Lucious, if we have to take Kingsley down, that’s what we’re going to do to protect our family and the empire. She asks if Lucious is down for that and he says that he is.

Lucious says he’s down to take on Kingsley, but what is that relationship going to look like now that they both know their connection? In the end, this still is Lucious’ blood, which is something that he’s been so tied to and motivated by throughout the entire series. Will he struggle with that?

That’s exactly right, the question that you’re asking, and it’s really because you know that character, Lucious Lyon. This kid is his son and he cannot ignore his blood, and despite the fact that that may be a problem for Cookie and his other sons, he can’t ignore it. For Kingsley, in getting to know Lucious, he’s learning that this narrative that he’s been fed his entire life from his mother may or may not have been true. So Kingsley needs to question everything he’s learned growing up, and now Lucious has to reach out to this man whose been made his enemy, when it’s actually someone who he could love and embrace.

You mentioned them in passing, but what is the reaction from the Lyon brothers going to be to this? While I anticipate Andre and Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) not being too kind to it, Jamal seems like he could be more accepting of an outcast brother.

Each one of them will be going through something that makes them see Kingsley differently and treat him differently. What you have to think about regarding Jamal is that Jamal is fiercely loyal to the Lyon family and he feels that Lucious has done him wrong — and yet he’s still loyal to Lucious. So despite this kid Kingsley believing he’s been treated badly by Lucious, Jamal doesn’t really feel that’s justification for what Kingsley has done.

Could Kingsley actually be a more powerful enemy now that his true identity is known to the world?

I think it’s more like with Kingsley being outed as a family member it’s now hard for the family to just deal with him with gloves off as they might with someone outside of their family. They’ve got to treat him differently because it’s almost like an enemy within. Andre has a line in the premiere where he goes, “If he’s telling the truth, I say we treat him like family…tear his ass down.”

Moving over to Jamal, we left him and Kai at a crossroads with Jamal seeming to choose his family over his fiancé, so where do we pick up with them and what’s the current dynamic there?

That’s going to be a struggle for them in the back half of the season. Whereas they had this idyllic life in London, now they’re here in New York and Jamal is back with his family and what does it mean for Jamal to be a Lyon? And is Jamal tired of apologizing for being a Lyon? And is it going to be up to Kai to either accept him or will they have to go their different ways? And for Kai, he’s going to get a real glimpse of what it actually means to be a Lyon, and he has to make a decision for himself if he wants to be associated with the family.

We last saw Andre in a flash forward, where he appeared to be on his death bed, so where — and when — do we pick up with that story line?

In the back nine episodes, we will no longer have flash forwards, so we’re going to catch up to all the flash forwards that we saw in the previous nine episodes. So that scene we saw of Andre flatlining is very close to our finale episode.

And with you now working on the finale, can you definitively say when we will learn who is in that coffin? Will that be finale based?

There are hints and fingers are pointed and you can get a feeling all throughout the back nine, and the question is finally answered in the finale.

You introduced this mystery in the season premiere, so have you known the identity of the fatality since the beginning or did you figure it out as you went?

I have always had a couple of candidates for who could be in the coffin. And there have been different places in the season in which we went back and forth as to actually who it is. And we’ve had arguments in the writer’s room, but story-wise, it’s always been a couple of candidates — and it’s one of our candidates.

So you’ve officially locked in on the final unlucky candidate?

Exactly. Because it’s not a coffin for two [laughs].

What else should we expect in the final nine episodes?

The direction is, be careful what you wish for. You have the Empire, but at what cost? What we’ve seen at the beginning of this is that the family was really brought together in this struggle to get Empire back, but each of them has a different vision of what that should be. And Cookie really wants Empire to be better and that’s going to be a stressor in her relationship with Lucious and a test of their marriage. Because while the Empire is often a wonderfully great thing, for some it’s also sort of poisonous. And what we will also see is the boys becoming men and creating families of their own.

Lastly, you’re gearing up on the final days of shooting season 5 and you have yet to get an official season 6 renewal, so are you feeling pretty confident that you’ll be able to continue this story?

I’m confident about it. I know that the network and studio is really happy with what we’ve done creatively this season. I’m not surprised that we don’t necessarily have a pick up at this point as I think last season we waited until May. All the indications I have are that we will be. And we do have so many of these stories to tell, so I can’t imagine we won’t be able to tell them.

As previously discussed, there have been rumors flying around, but it sounds like you never put any stock in the suggestion that the recent drama could put the show in jeopardy?

No, I would never have guessed that.

Empire returns Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.

That’s because “Empire,” which set the nation on fire when it first emerged on Fox TV five years ago, may not get renewed. Some folks on the set are very concerned that the “Empire” show may not be able to survive this scandal and that the show may get canceled altogether.

“Empire” was already slipping in the ratings long before the Smollett debacle, but Smollett’s 16-count felony indictment puts the show in a precarious position, TMZ reports. While it still retains a respectable 5-6 million viewership, that is far from the 15 million viewers it had during season 1 that had every Hollywood celebrity and their mother wanting to do guest roles on the show.

This is why anxiety is high and morale is low on the “Empire” set on the eve of the airing of its fifth season. Fox has not made any announcement about its renewal and it’s already mid-March. In previous years, Fox made the announcement about keeping the show going in January of every year.

Some on the set who have been employed throughout the history of the show complained recently they haven’t been told anything as of yet.

Keep in mind that Fox waited until a few weeks before the season 4 finale was set to air in May, to announce that “Empire” would come back for a fifth season.

Folks involved in the production told TMZ believe that Smollett’s sensational scandal is playing a big role in Fox’s eventual decision to keep or throw away the show.

As for now, TMZ said “Empire” creator Lee Daniels and other decision-makers, decided that Smollett’s character is being removed from the final two episodes of season 5, which is set to return from a hiatus on Wednesday night. For the interim period, until producers and Fox decide what to do with Smollett’s character, they will just say that Jamal Lyons is “out of the country.”

To no one’s surprise, Smollett’s character may not return from “out of the country.” Smollett has been a lightning rod of controversy and division since his scandal erupted nearly two months ago. There are many people who don’t want Smollett back on the show — even the folks who have publicly expressed support for him."

Surveillance technology is becoming more sophisticated and less expensive, allowing families to turn their homes, inside and out, into surveillance states.

“I used to joke that every house should have a sign that says, ‘By entering this house, you are consenting to being videotaped and recorded and having all that uploaded to the cloud,'” said Irina Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics Program at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California.

While some people install cameras for security, others use them to monitor their nannies and pet sitters, or keep an eye on aging loved ones and their caregivers. Some parents have captured their baby’s first steps on these cameras; others have documented child or elder abuse, theft or infidelity.

But with few laws governing private surveillance, some people are using technology to push up against the lines of propriety, doing things like tracking email to see if someone has forwarded a note to another person or installing cameras in a home that's for sale in order to hear conversations that could help negotiate a higher price.

As such, the technology is subtly affecting human relationships, analysts say. Some people argue that cameras build trust; others maintain that it erodes it. Whitlee Hodson, a nanny in Omaha, Nebraska, says she wouldn’t work for a family that trusted her so little that they felt compelled to use cameras. James Fullerton, a father of four who has 11 cameras, calls them a godsend.

Absent laws that govern cameras and other types of in-home surveillance, people who use the technology are writing their own rules. But privacy experts warn that before installing surveillance devices, people should think carefully about who can get access to the information they collect, as well as how surveillance affects relationships. ""It can have a chilling effect on human interactions if you're worried constantly that somebody's listening in,"" Raicu said.

Smaller and cheaper

Although violent crime in the U.S. has declined, nearly 6 in 10 Americans report that they are concerned every day about their personal safety, according to a recent survey by SafeWise. (Utahns, however, report feeling safer than people in other states, according to the report. Forty percent worry about property crime, compared to 62 percent of other respondents in the West.)

The first generation of security cameras addressed those concerns, and as cameras got smaller and cheaper and live images could be broadcast over cellphones, their use expanded. Walmart, for example, sells a Wi-Fi-enabled camera for under $35 that allows people to not only see what's going on at home, but also to talk to people there.

About 10 percent of U.S. homes with broadband also have a security camera that can send images over the internet, according to Brad Russell, research director of Parks Associates. That’s up 6 percent from 2014. The company predicts that 50 million households will have at least one of these cameras in the next five years.

You have two choices: You can bury your head in the sand and hope for the best, or be proactive and get yourself some eyes on the scene. – Perry Myers, owner of two U-Spy stores

Perry Myers, owner of two U-Spy stores that sell surveillance equipment for businesses and individuals in Chicago and online, said most people buy cameras to keep their children safe when they’re in the care of others.

Using cameras, parents can monitor everything from “attentiveness to the work ethic to the safety of the child” when a babysitter or nanny is in the house. And people can also monitor the work of housekeepers or pet sitters. “You have two choices: You can bury your head in the sand and hope for the best, or be proactive and get yourself some eyes on the scene,” Myers said.

Myers used a “nanny cam” in his house when his daughter was younger, and uses it today when he wants to see if his daughter, now 12, is at her desk doing homework. He also used a camera two years ago after his mother had a ring and some money stolen from her room at an assisted-living facility.

He put a $20 bill in one of her drawers as “bait” and then installed a camera, which later revealed the identity of the thief. By doing so, he was able to recover the money and the ring. (The thief, an employee at the home, was fired.)

Myers, who is also a private investigator, says he believes the widespread use of cameras are generally good for society, noting that footage from video cameras helped Chicago police charge actor Jussie Smollett with lying to police. Public video footage also recently helped Boston police solve a murder.

Hodson, a 27-year-old nanny in Omaha, Nebraska, said she has no problem with cameras used for law enforcement, but cameras in the private homes where she works are intimate and invasive, she said.

It’s just another example of how our privacy laws have failed to keep up with changing technology. – Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst specializing in privacy issues with the American Civil Liberties Union

Hodson said she once interviewed for a job in which the parents said they had cameras and said ""we will be watching all the time."" During the job interview, the father even started watching a video feed from his driveway, where someone had just pulled up. She decided not to work for that family.

""Usually people get these cameras, and they think they're being good and proactive and protective, but what ends up happening is a lot of good nannies quit"" if they get constant criticism from parents who are always observing, she said. ""If you stand over someone's shoulder long enough, you are going to find something you don't like.""

Hodson also said that hidden cameras give parents a false sense of security. ""Even if you catch something on tape, you didn't prevent it from happening,"" she said. It's better, Hodson said, for parents to check a nanny's background and references and have a trial period with parents present before hiring, instead of relying on a camera to reveal a problem.

When bad things happen, however, cameras can keep them from happening again. A Utah nanny, for example, was recently fired and charged with child abuse after footage allegedly showed her kicking and shaking 5-month-old twins.

Fullerton, a software developer and father of children ranging in age from newborn to 6, said he also once fired a babysitter after observing her being rough with his son via a live video feed.

But for Fullerton and his wife, cameras are more than a way to ensure their children are safe with they're with a sitter; they're also an invaluable parenting aid they can use to speak to their children when they're on separate floors and to monitor the children's safety and behavior while they're playing. ""I don't think we got them out of a place of fear, but more out of a position of convenience,"" he said.

The cameras have also bestowed an unexpected bonus: They captured the first steps of two of the Fullertons' children.

What's legal

The law is murky when it comes to home surveillance, but people who own hidden cameras may be breaking the law if their footage contains audio and they live in a state that, like Massachusetts and California, requires two-party notification of recordings.

Utah is a one-party consent state, which means that recordings are legal so long as one of the people involved (i.e., the person who owns the camera) consents, said David Reymann, a commercial litigator with Parr Brown Gee & Loveless in Salt Lake City.

Wiretapping laws govern audio recordings only, however, and most were written before cellphones and home security cameras were invented, said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst specializing in privacy issues with the American Civil Liberties Union.

“It’s just another example of how our privacy laws have failed to keep up with changing technology,” Stanley said.

When it comes to video, there can be a legal difference between cameras pointing out — such as a doorbell camera that films your neighbor cutting his yard across the street — and those recording what’s going on inside your house. Usually, filming outdoors on your property is lawful if the purpose is security, although sharing that video on social media could get you in trouble. Inside, laws generally prohibit filming in any space in which people have “an expectation of privacy,” such as a bathroom.

“You don’t have the right to put a camera in your bathroom and watch your guests taking a shower. But I don’t know of any state regulating how people use their own private surveillance cameras,” Stanley said.

That has led to situations such as people who are selling their homes using cameras to eavesdrop on people walking through the home or standing on the porch discussing the property with their real-estate agent.

“It’s one of those things where it is the person’s home — they have the right to do whatever — but you feel a little violated,” Andie DeFelice, a broker with Savannah-based Exclusive Buyer’s Realty Inc., told Andrea Riquier of MarketWatch last year.

Some Airbnb customers have also been surprised to discover their rentals had cameras, and in many states, landlords are allowed to install cameras in common rooms of the properties they rent.

That said, Myers, with Chicago's U-Spy stores, said few people who have cameras have the time or interest to sit around watching the feeds. ""People are going to cameras when there's an incident or an event or some kind of suspicion, not for entertainment,"" he said.

A matter of trust

In most states, such recordings are legal as long as the homeowner posts a notification somewhere on the property that cameras are in use, said Thal Dixon, owner of Dixon Security Cameras, which is based in Salt Lake City and has locations in Utah and California.

“As long as you tell them you have cameras, you don’t have to say where,” said Dixon, whose business sells a variety of cameras that are concealed within ordinary items, such as an alarm clock, a necktie, sunglasses and even a smiley-face pin that clips on clothing or a refrigerator. (The camera lens is concealed in the right eye of the face.)

But although Dixon offers concealed cameras for people who want them, he generally advises clients to install cameras in plain sight.

“My experience is, just put up the regular camera and be done. Don’t worry about hiding them,” he said. That’s because knowing the cameras are there generally puts people on their best behavior at first. “But after a while, people get immune to cameras and forget that they’re there.”

Besides the law, consumers who install cameras, either secretly or overtly, need to be aware that video sent over the internet might not be secure. Stanley, of the ACLU, noted reports earlier this year that the feeds of Amazon’s Ring doorbell camera may have been watched by members of a research and development firm in Ukraine.

There have also been instances of footage from nanny cams being watched by hackers. In 2014, a hacker displayed thousands of feeds from private homes across the world on a website.

Security breaches can happen if the consumer fails to change the factory-installed password with a unique one that they choose, said Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics Program in Santa Clara, California. Raicu said America needs broad-based privacy laws that would protect consumers by doing things like requiring manufacturers of cameras to mandate a new password before the device is used.

Fullerton added that manufacturers should also be required to provide automatic security updates, and if the devices do not update automatically, they should be able to shut themselves down. Consumers should research the vulnerabilities of any camera they're thinking of buying and learn what it will take to keep them updated, he said.

The desire to snoop into other people’s lives isn’t new. “People have always had this curiosity, but no means to implement it besides being a peeping Tom or opening other people’s letters,"" Raicu said.

“But suddenly, you have all these tools, and broadly, it starts to feel like a disrespect for the dignity of other human beings, the fact that you have this power and use it against people who don’t know you’re using it,” Raicu said.

One way to act ethically with security cameras is to not use them covertly.

""As a matter of etiquette, and probably law, you should inform people that they are being recorded, and not be a jerk or creepy,"" said Stanley, the senior policy analyst with the ACLU.

But Raicu also said people should think carefully about the risks versus the benefits. ""There are some very serious implications beyond the personal creeping out. And there's no reason that we should accept this (a surveilled society) as a given."" One of her concerns is how parents are using cellphones and cameras to monitor where their children are and what they're doing.

""Sometimes parents, with the best of intentions, end up tracking their own children to the point where I worry that children will think this is normal,"" she said. ""Growing up so surveilled, they won't have the opportunity to really be themselves.""

Hodson, the nanny in Omaha, said she and many other child care providers that she knows believe that cameras erode trust, a foundation of good relationships. She currently works for a family with a 2-year-old and another child on the way. ""I expect to be here for a long time, but I wouldn't stay if I felt they didn't trust me enough,"" she said."

On Wednesday, “Empire” makes what should’ve been an uneventful return to TV to finish its fifth season, except that now, star Jussie Smollett’s real-life scandal has overshadowed any melodrama that the Lyon clan has experienced. In January, the actor reported that he was attacked in what appeared to be an alleged hate crime while in Chicago. However, an investigation cast doubt on his account, and by March, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of “false report of offense” related to the incident.

Although he maintains his innocence, the seriousness of the alleged crime could not be ignored. In a statement supporting due process, series producers distanced “Empire” from the scandal and stated that Smollett’s character Jamal would be removed from the final two episodes of the season. But it will be difficult to forget about Smollett when he continues to appear on screen. In Wednesday’s episode, Jamal figures prominently with a meaty emotional storyline in addition to two musical numbers.

What happens with “Empire” once Smollett’s seven of the nine remaining episodes air is still uncertain. Fox could cancel the series to be done with the Lyon family and any stigma from the case once and for all, but that seems like overkill. In the past, a handful of TV shows have been abruptly canceled in the wake of their star’s alleged criminal activities. In 2009, the VH1 reality show “Megan Wants a Millionaire” was canceled mid-season once it was revealed that contestant Ryan Jenkins was suspected of murdering his wife, whose body was found in a suitcase. In 2015, reality show “19 Kids and Counting” pulled the plug after eldest son Josh Duggar’s history of molesting his siblings came to light.

However, those extreme cases need not apply to “Empire” because its scripted nature gives it enough distance from reality. Jamal is not Smollett. Besides, “Empire” is one of Fox’s stronger performing dramas, boasts an inclusive cast, and therefore is worth keeping around from a business standpoint. Also, Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson are enough of a draw to lead the Lyon family’s story, which doesn’t rest on any one supporting character.

According to one report, recasting the role of Jamal is another option favored by co-creator Lee Daniels since the character is supposedly loosely based on himself. Certainly this strategy has been used on TV shows before, dating back to the two Darrens on “Bewitched,” Aunt Viv on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” and the two Beckys on “Roseanne,” among others.

Or, “Empire” could eliminate the role of Jamal and fill that gap in the story with another character altogether. This was a viable option for “Two and a Half Men,” which replaced Charlie Sheen after his continued erratic behavior. The show killed off his character, subbed in Ashton Kutcher as billionaire Walden Schmidt, and then lasted a healthy four seasons afterward. In the case of “House of Cards,” sexual abuse allegations prompted the removal of star Kevin Spacey. This spelled the end of the show though. In its final season, Spacey’s onscreen wife played by Robin Wright took over in the role as president.

For now, a Fox insider said that viewers will have to watch and see how the character of Jamal is resolved. By appearing in a mainstream broadcast series, Smollett was able to portray an out and proud gay black man week to week. Whatever path “Empire” chooses, it’s a shame that the impact and legacy of that character has now been tainted.

”Empire” airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for March 14. During that hearing, the case will be assigned to a trial judge who will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

With regards to his acting abilities, this will be his finest hour! https://t.co/LrsYQjYS51 #tcot #maga — Chris Krok (@chriskrokshow) March 12, 2019

During the hearing, which was held after local news organizations requested that cameras be allowed in the courtroom, Judge LeRoy Martin, Jr. said that the new judge will decide whether or not to allow cameras in the courtroom during subsequent hearings and the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is “demonstrably false.”

“We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” she said.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct—the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police—because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

Smollett’s attorneys have called 16 counts “prosecutorial overkill.” The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence.

Robin Roberts Said Jussie Smollett Interview Was a ‘No Win,’ Hesitated to Do It

ABC reporter Robin Roberts said that the interview she conducted with “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett regarding an alleged attack against him was a “no win.”

Roberts admitted on March 4 that she initially resisted doing the interview because Smollett’s story—that he was assaulted by two white men in downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures and that he held onto his Subway sandwich—didn’t seem to be real.

Smollett also claimed that one of the alleged attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” in an apparent reference to “Make America Great Again,” a slogan of President Donald Trump and his supporters.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” Roberts told the crowd at an event in New York City on Monday, reported the New York Post. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts, 58, said she was promised she could challenge Smollett, 36, on the “red flags” in his story. She finally relented.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,” she said.

The subsequent interview was slammed by many as soft, with Roberts seemingly attempting to cast Smollett in a favorable light. It didn’t help that two days after the interview, when it aired, Chicago police arrested two Nigerian-American brothers who detectives said later revealed that Smollett orchestrated the attack, making it a hate crime hoax.

Roberts said she was cognizant of identity politics—with both her and the actor being black and gay—and knew she would be criticized by people who thought she wasn’t hard enough on Smollett while also facing questions from those supporting the actor.

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she said. At the time, since Smollett was still considered a victim, she framed her questions to acknowledge that context.

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do,” she said.

After the brothers were arrested, ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams said during a “Good Morning America” segment that comments Smollett made during the interview with Roberts could be used against him if the story does indeed turn out to be false.

Among them was Smollett’s confidence that the two people seen in surveillance footage walking near the scene of the alleged attack about 30 minutes before it reportedly took place were the same people that attacked him.

“In that interview, [Smollett] specifically says, ‘Yeah, those two guys on the surveillance footage, those are the guys that attacked me,’ so now he’s sort of boxed in,” Abrams said.

Police identified the two people as the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, supporting the case that they were the attackers. When they informed police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the alleged hoax, officials began looking at Smollett as a suspect.

The actor was eventually arrested on Feb. 21 for filing a false police report.

In a statement in March, the brothers said they regretted helping Smollett perpetrate the alleged attack.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” said Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, in a statement obtained by CBS Chicago.

Previously, the Osundairos, who met Smollett while acting on “Empire” and one of whom became the actor’s personal trainer, said in a statement that they’re not racist.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they said on Feb. 18.

“In due course, all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible,” added the brothers’ attorney, Schmidt.

Former Trump attorney and disgraced convicted felon Michael Cohen recently gave testimony before Congress focused upon negative allegations against his former boss. Those who spent their time watching the sordid political theater came away with two unavoidable, tired, previously known conclusions: Cohen is a proven liar and President Donald Trump, like each of us, is an imperfect person.

But for millions of Americans, myself included, the made-for-TV drama is largely irrelevant, as America is doing quite well under the controversial leadership of President Trump.

Before he became President Trump, everyone knew that “the Donald” was a controversial business icon. In fact, part of his appeal was the role he played as a billionaire playboy whose brash style help him rise to the top of the cutthroat business of real estate development. Whether roasting Rosie O’Donnell on prime-time television or entertaining millions on “The Apprentice,” Trump was known for being an unconventional and high-flying international businessman.

But now, as the president, his racy past has followed him to the White House and become an obsession for the Democrats, so consumed by hatred and so desperate to pursue an increasingly socialist agenda. What better crowbar to open Trump’s past and perpetuate a media war against him than his former attorney? After all, Michael Cohen is a desperate man still hoping to reduce his own prison term by bashing his former employer.

While Cohen’s recent testimony produced wall-to-wall coverage by political insiders, the press has been promoting hysteria ever since the 2016 election, using every chance to demonize the Commander-in-Chief. Hardly a week passes without some “shocking” revelation that is eventually proven wholly untrue or at least largely irrelevant.

Fake news is not just a tagline made famous by the president. It’s real, and it’s exhausting. In January, Cohen was the central figure in a BuzzFeed report that has since been discredited. In the report, Cohen states that he was instructed by Trump to lie to Congress.

Cohen is not the only example of the media’s desperation to attack all things Trump. In the past few weeks, their bias has been on clear display. The press prematurely hyped an edited video of a Trump supporter standing before a Native American provocateur. Of course, there is also the outrageous Jussie Smollett fiasco, in which the actor apparently faked a hate crime and ascribed it to alleged Trump supporters.

In the coming days, expect a flood of speculative reports from media personalities about the possible legal implications of this and that from Cohen’s testimony. Regardless, the fundamental reality is this: Our country is thriving economically, militarily and on the world stage. Cohen’s congressional performance is just another example of the mainstream media’s increasingly desperate attempt to exploit any situation that allows them to attack the president. But the American people know this: Unemployment is down. Wages and earnings are up. Our economic growth is healthy.

Militarily, the United States is properly funded and more equipped than ever, with ISIS all but eradicated. Trade negotiations that protect, rather than undermine, our interests are underway with numerous countries. The American energy sector is humming along.

America is surging forward, and the president is fulfilling his promise to make our country great again. The biggest threat to the strength of our democracy is our own media’s constant fanning of toxic flames of hatred toward our president.

Most of President Trump’s supporters know that he is not a perfect person, but they will continue to remain loyal and give him their support. The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it is often the most unlikely people who go on to accomplish the most. Consider the prophet Moses, widely regarded as one of the greatest of prophets in the Bible. Moses led the children of Israel out of bondage to the Promised Land, despite the fact that he was a murderer!

In this case, our nation is led by a businessman with many flaws who also happens to be the right person for the job at a time when America needs it the most. We are thirsting for economic progress, following eight years in the wilderness of Obama’s presidency. Our present prosperity far outshines the flashing lights of manufactured scandals.

Trump has delivered on so many of the promises that catapulted him into office. Despite the media and the establishment’s campaign against him, tens of millions of his voters will continue to stand by him. He may be an imperfect person, but the same can be said for every single one of us. Who among us can claim to be without flaws? Thankfully, Trump is right where he should be today: in the Oval Office, propelling our country forward.

In a recent 30-minute interview on her personal YouTube channel, the star got incredibly candid about fellow actors Jussie Smollett and Alyssa Milano, as well as Donald Trump and the Democratic Party.

The 66-year-old sat down for a lengthy interview with self-proclaimed hip-hop artist and news analyst Anomaly to discuss a slew of topics, starting with the controversy surrounding “Empire” star Jussie Smollett.

The former “Roseanne” star went on to talk about how a culture of identity politics has led to people like herself losing work over a racist tweet and people like Smollett, who may have committed genuine crimes, getting the same vitriol in the public eye.

After advocating for people to be without a political party, she called out one star in particular.

“Alyssa Milano — I just want to say this about her kind of people that allow themselves to be used to hurt other people. When they do wake up all the way, I’m not going to forgive them, and I don’t think any of us should,” Barr said. “It’s either, like, walk away now or f*** off, because you’re hurting a lot of people and not thinking and just going along to get along. And you thought you’d make a name by hurting other people and you’re not going to be forgiven.”

At the time of Barr’s firing from ABC, Milano, who has become an activist for several left-leaning causes, was one of the many outspoken critics of the comedian.

Despite her harsh words for the former “Charmed” star, Barr’s most heated comments were directed at the Democratic Party.

She brought up the topic of America’s southern border, saying that the Left is “going down” over its inaction.

“I’ll say it. All that stuff that’s happening at the border is about trafficking and slavery,” she said. “And if Democrats can’t see that, then they’re collusionary in it. It’s just more proof of how hard they’re going to go down. The more people who are waking up and seeing it … the better.”

She continued, “There’s a lot of darkness in our government, a lot of dark people, and they just pick low-hanging fruit. And human trafficking and drugs are low-hanging fruit. And then they can make a killing on it, literally.”

Barr even noted that she saw what she perceives as the Democrats’ turn to socialism coming as early as 2012, when she ran a campaign for president.

“I knew in 2012 when I ran that the Democrats were going to go socialist because I ran as a Green, and I saw that there was too much fraternizing between those two,” she revealed. “And I knew that Democrats were … They wanted to fight the Green Party, so they became the Green Party. They became a socialist party and they are. And the bad part of this is that it’s American socialism. That’s not even socialism. It’s corporate socialism, which is feudalism.”

Barr even pitched a solution to help with what she feels is holding America back.

“There’s a lot of people, particularly my age, people that are retired that — they should step up. They should step up, as I’ve said for a long time, to run for office if they’re a decent human. We need decent humans to run for office, but no one wants to because they’ll destroy you if you say one word or one tweet. But we have to fight back because it’s really Stalinist — it’s like the whole Stalin revolution, if you said one thing wrong, they’d shoot you in the back of the head. And that’s next.”

Barr’s only positive comments were for President Donald Trump, whom she heralded for being tough on banks and the economy.

“He isn’t a Republican, and he’s not a Democrat, and it’s something very new that people can’t get their heads around,” she said. “I wish people would read more about how he’s handling the Fed and interest rates, and how he’s smashing at every level.”

For example, on February 22, Washington Post gossip Helena Andrews-Dyer penned a piece on how presidential candidates like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris campaign on ""pop culture"" issues in social media and on hipster venues, including on the Jussie Smollett hate-crimes hoax. The article was posted the day after Chicago police took Smollett into custody, but the ""experts"" were still saying ""you can never go wrong""...being fast, and wrong.

Folks running for president in the digital age are controlled by memes and discourse that takes place online — it’s faster,” explains VaNatta Ford, an assistant professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts. “They’re really trying to engage with millennials and Gen Z, and in order to do that they have to be hip to what’s happening.” That’s how Harris and Booker (among other politicians) ended up becoming part of the Jussie Smollett saga. Smollett alleged that on Jan. 29 he was beaten in Chicago by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs. Both senators described the attack in the very same way on social media: “a modern-day lynching.” .... Was this a misstep for the presidential aspirants? Ford says no, in part because this was more serious — and more political — territory than your average viral story. “To get out in front of it when it happened, that’s one thing politicians should be doing, calling out racism,” says Ford. “When it comes to standing up for the black LGBT community, being fast is never a bad thing. You can never go wrong with that.”

This is a strange enough stance on February 22. But The Washington Post Magazine actually containing this article was distributed in the D.C. area on Sunday, March 10. Everything over the last few weeks has only hardened the fact that Smollett made up this incident.

For a newspaper that claims to be against Fake News, why are they promoting this nonsense? Crying ""lynching"" during a hate-crime moax ""can never go wrong""?? Andrews-Dyer was more concerned about Booker and Harris using fake-sounding slang than fake-sounding hate crimes, and concluded:"

As a matter of fact, Wednesday will mark the first new episode of the hip-hop soap since well before Smollett — who plays the openly-gay Jamal Lyon — told Chicago cops he was assaulted on Jan. 29.

The last original “Empire” aired on Dec. 5, which ended with Jeff Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) telling Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), Andre (Trai Byers), Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) and Jamal that he is Lucious’ (Terrence Howard) son and a flash-forward showing Andre flatlining in front of his parents, giving fans more fuel for their theories about who is in that casket in all those other flash-forward scenes we’ve seen this season.

With Jamal’s real-life counterpart indicted on 16 felony counts by a Chicago grand jury last week and set to appear in court this Thursday, will the Lyon family’s Nielsen-ratings roar be quieter due to Smollett’s current standing in the court of public opinion? Or could viewers’ curiosity about what happens to Jamal — who has been written out of the season’s final two episodes — cause a bump?

In Live + 7 day data, this season of “Empire” is down 15 percent among adults 18-49 — a 2.3 vs. a 2.7 — which is the demographic most sought-after by companies that advertise on primetime entertainment programming. The Fox drama is down 7 percent in total viewers, with an average of 7.2 million per episode vs. last season’s 7.7 million.

Last year’s mid-season return came on March 28, when it posted a 2.0 “live” rating in the demo and 6.217 million viewers overall. The show’s night-of viewing has taking a disproportionate hit compared with those week-of declines. That’s not unusual.

All told, Season 4 averaged a 1.9 Live + Same Day rating and 5.850 million total viewers. To-date, Season 5 is down 21 percent in the demo and 13 percent overall from last year’s benchmarks.

What that means is should seasonal trends stay true, expect Wednesday’s episode, titled “My Fault Is Past,” to draw a 1.6 “live” rating and 5.409 million total viewers. We expect a curiosity-based boost, however. While we’re not going to wager a specific guess on this one, one TV ratings expert at a competing network told TheWrap they expect about a 5 to 10 percent gain from what the Season 5B premiere might have otherwise received.

Fox declined to participate in this story.

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” Smollett’s team said in a statement that day. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Within hours of his release from police custody, Smollett returned to work on the set of “Empire.” However, the following day, executive producers announced that they had decided to remove the actor from the final two episodes of Season 5.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” read the statement from “Empire” co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, showrunner Brett Mahoney, and executive producers Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the statement continued. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The decision to cut Smollett came after “Empire” studio 20th Century Fox stated last month it was “considering [its] options” following the news of his arrest. A day earlier, the studio had renewed its support for the actor, saying, “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

“Empire” Season 5 returns Wednesday at 8/7c on Fox."

At this point, no one knows who is telling the truth: the Chicago Police Department or the “Empire” actor.

Now, the lawyer for Smollett’s alleged accomplices, Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, appeared to only make things worse in an awkward interview on “Good Morning America” on Monday.

Gloria Schmidt told George Stephanopoulos that the $3,500 the Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers were paid for staging the attack was actually for fitness training.

“They were paid for the training … but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” she said.

When pressed about whether there was any evidence to back up their claims, she said they were asked to “do this favor.”

When pushed on what incentive brothers had to stage the attacked, Schmidt said, “If you’re friends, and I’m saying ‘Hey, I’m going to pay you for training, I’m also asking you to do me a favor’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Schmidt claimed the brothers also feel “taken advantage of,” but she wouldn’t directly answer if she thought the attack was a hoax.

“I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime,” Schmidt said.

Smollett on Friday was indicted by a grand jury on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” the actor’s lawyer, Mark Geragos told CNN on Friday. “And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

He continued, calling out the Chicago Police Department.

“He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report,” Geragos said. “Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay for anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

Geragos also challenged the idea that Smollett staged an attack because he wanted a higher salary on the prime time soap opera.

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” he said. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

He also accused Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool."

5am – A/B/C THE PROBLEM OF THE OFFICE FOOD THIEF:

Pregnant woman sick of having her lunch stolen at work gets the culprit FIRED by revealing incriminating pictures during an interview – but do YOU think the food thief deserved to go? (Daily Mail) — Odds are if you work in an office you’ll have had an item of food go missing from the communal fridge at some stage during your career. But one pregnant woman, believed to be from the US, has told how she reached breaking point after her lunch started going missing on a daily basis. Eventually the thief was caught after she begged management to install cameras – and it turned out to be a middle-aged female employee on three times her salary who was in line for a promotion. But instead of stepping up, she ended up being shown the door after her brazen thieving was exposed. Taking to the Reddit thread Am I the A**hole, the mother-to-be explained how her husband is a chef and makes her lunch every day.’I need to eat well because I’m naturally thin/underweight, I’m still breastfeeding my toddler, and I am pregnant,’ she wrote. When her lunch started getting stolen, she began labeling it in the hope it would deter the thief – to no avail. She went on: ‘Eventually I put a note on the fridge that said: “Please stop taking my food. I am pregnant and breastfeeding and this is negatively affecting my health.”‘ When that failed, the woman sent an email to the entire office asking whoever was taking her food to talk to her privately as her husband would make them lunch too, provided they pay for the meal. Perhaps unsurprisingly, several people took her up on her husband’s generous offer, and she ended up making a side business out of it. However, the thief remained silent and continued to nick her lunch. ‘My lunches are always in specific bowls, unlike the lunches others had from my husband, in disposable containers,’ she said.

5am – D BirthStrikers: meet the women who refuse to have children until climate change ends. (The Guardian) — A movement of women have decided not to procreate in response to the coming ‘climate breakdown and civilisation collapse’. Will their protest be a catalyst for change? As soon as Blythe Pepino got together with her partner Joshua two years ago, she felt “this overwhelming urge to create a family with him”, she says. “I think it was the fifth day after having met him, I said: ‘I’ve got to meet your parents.’ He was like: ‘You’re mad.’” Then, late last year, she attended a lecture held by the direct action group Extinction Rebellion, which set out starkly the catastrophic reality of the changing climate. That galvanised Pepino, an activist and musician (she is the former singer of Vaults, now Mesadorm), to do research of her own and, eventually, to have a series of sad conversations with Joshua. “I realised that even though I wanted to have a family at that point, I couldn’t really bring myself to do it,” she says. “I had to say to him: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, considering what we know – if there isn’t a political will to fix this, we really don’t stand much of a chance.’” Pepino, who turns 33 today, found that other women – especially those in climate-conscious circles – were struggling with the same question, but were “too afraid to talk about it” for fear of judgment or ridicule. The US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave voice to their concerns last month, pointing to the increasingly dire scientific consensus and widespread government inaction: “It does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK still to have children?”

5am – E Lisa Page transcripts reveal details of anti-Trump ‘insurance policy,’ concerns over full-blown probe. (Fox News) — House Judiciary Committee Republicans on Tuesday released hundreds of pages of transcripts from last year’s closed-door interview with ex-FBI attorney Lisa Page, revealing new details about the bureau’s controversial internal discussions regarding an “insurance policy” against then-candidate Donald Trump. Page first entered the spotlight in December 2017, when it was revealed by the Justice Department inspector general that she and then-FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok exchanged numerous anti-Trump text messages. The two were involved in the FBI’s initial counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 election, and later served on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Among their texts was one concerning the so-called “insurance policy.” During her interview with the Judiciary Committee in July 2018, Page was questioned at length about that text — and essentially confirmed this referred to the Russia investigation while explaining that officials were proceeding with caution, concerned about the implications of the case while not wanting to go at “total breakneck speed” and risk burning sources as they presumed Trump wouldn’t be elected anyway. Further, she confirmed investigators only had a “paucity” of evidence at the start.



6am – A/B/C FBI: Parents paid up to $6.5M for guaranteed admission. 50 People Charged In Sweeping College Admissions Bribery Scam. Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were charged along with nearly 50 other people Tuesday in a scheme in which wealthy parents bribed college coaches and insiders at testing centers to get their children into some of the most elite schools in the country, federal prosecutors said. Authorities called it the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department. “These parents are a catalog of wealth and privilege,” Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said at Boston federal court in announcing the $25 million bribery case against 50 people in all. At least nine athletic coaches and 33 parents were among those charged in the investigation, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. Dozens, including Huffman, were arrested by midday Tuesday.

6am – D INTERVIEW – CAL THOMAS – syndicated columnist – discussed antisemitism of the Democrats and

Cal Thomas wrote about “The Democrats’ Jewish problem” in Washington Times: In 2012, Ms. Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The implication was that Israel and its backers are being manipulated to support the Jewish state. This old anti-Semitic trope will be familiar to anyone with a minimal understanding of the history of the Jewish people and the genocidal goal of their enemies. Yes, Ms. Omar apologized, but not until she got to Congress. This assumes her apology was more political, than sincere. Consider her appeal to “Allah.” Why would she, or any Muslim, disobey Allah?

6am – E CNN’s Mary Katharine Ham Defends Tucker Carlson’s Non-Apology: ‘Outrage Mobs’ Aren’t Interested in Contrition. (Mediaite) — CNN political commentator and conservative blogger Mary Katharine Ham offered some rare words of support on the network’s air for Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson Tuesday — as she defended Carlson’s non-apology for unearthed offensive comments. Appearing on CNN’s New Day, Ham argued that any contrition offered by the Fox News host would do little to placate his critics. “I do think he’s right when he says that if he apologizes, nothing ends, and nobody’s interested in his apology,” Ham said. “I think that’s true. I think that’s how outrage mobs operate.” Ham argued that while Carlson’s comments were offensive, re-litigating past remarks can be “corrosive.” “I wrote an entire book about how I don’t like coming for people’s heads, and people’s jobs because they say things people don’t like,” Ham said. “And I actually believe what I wrote. And I do think there’s another thing that’s corrosive in addition to people saying mean things. And it is the impulse to take people down, and to take people’s jobs for, [say], errant Facebook posts. Which is something that happens to real people, not just public figures.” Ham added, “Look, if it wasn’t a fireable offense for MSNBC ten years ago [where Carlson was employed at the time], it ain’t a fireable offense now,” Ham said.

6am – F Flight returns to Saudi Arabia airport after mom left her baby in the waiting area. (Fox News) — The aviation crew operating a recent Saudi Arabian Airlines flight to Malaysia diverted the plane for quite an unusual reason: a passenger reportedly left her baby in the waiting area of the King Abdul Aziz International Airport. Over the weekend, flight SV832 from Jeddah to Kuala Lampur turned back after a woman alerted flight crew that she had left her child at the airport, Gulf News reports. Video footage of a recording titled “a passenger forgot her child at the airport” in Arabic has since been viewed over 850,000 times on YouTube — and sparked plenty of merciless “Home Alone” comparisons, too. “May God be with us. Can we come back or what?” the pilot allegedly said to an air traffic controller in the minute-long clip, according to the outlet. “This flight is requesting to come back…a passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area, the poor thing,” the pilot detailed, adding that the woman “refuses to continue the flight.” “Ok, head back to the gate. This is totally a new one for us!” the operator replied, giving the flight crew official permission to turn around the aircraft.



7am – A INTERVIEW – ISAIAS MEDINA – an international lawyer and former Venezuelan UN Diplomat

BIO: Isaias Medina III, Edward S. Mason fellow MPA/MLD candidate at Harvard University, is an international lawyer, humanitarian activist, counter-terrorism expert, former Venezuelan UN Diplomat at the Security Council. He publicly resigned to protest Human Rights violations and denounced more than 20 top officials including Maduro to the ICC, serving as a witness to the OAS. He is a strong advocate of the International Anticorruption Court TOPIC: The United States is withdrawing all remaining diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, because of worsening conditions in the country, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Monday. U.S. Runs Low on Options to Oust Venezuelan Ruler. WASHINGTON — Hours before he pulled American diplomats from Venezuela, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confronted the growing crisis in the country by blaming not only its embattled ruler, but also a broader menace: socialism. His diagnosis echoed President Trump’s line of attack against potential Democratic rivals in 2020, and there is little question that the far-left ideology of Venezuela’s government shares some responsibility for the dysfunction that has thrown the country into chaos. But Mr. Pompeo’s broadside against President Nicolás Maduro also obscured the fact that the United States had just about run out of options to achieve its goal in Caracas: a peaceful change of power. “Nicolás Maduro promised Venezuelans a better life in a socialist paradise,” Mr. Pompeo said on Monday. “And he delivered on the socialism part, which has proved time and time again is a recipe for economic ruin.” The United States has imposed sanctions to cut off Venezuela’s oil revenues and against banks, including one in Russia. It has canceled the visas of officials in the Maduro government and talked to nations about taking in others who might seek asylum or a safe haven. And it maintains that “all options are on the table” — even while assuring allies that military intervention, of the kind that the United States has had a long and ugly history of carrying out in Latin America, is not really being considered. But Mr. Maduro remains, to the surprise of many in the Trump administration.

7am – B Romney Blows Out His Birthday Candles In The Weirdest Way. A tweet featuring a video showing the senator picking candles off his Twinkie birthday cake has gone viral. It’s Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah)’s birthday, and he can blow out his candles any way he wants. The former Republican presidential nominee celebrated his 72nd birthday on Tuesday with a “cake” made of Twinkies, which he called his “favorite snack.” “What I always wanted!” exclaimed Romney in a video featuring members of his Senate staff singing to him and carrying the festive dessert. After the cake was put down on his desk, an excited Romney removed each candle individually, blowing them out one by one, indicating he’d get a wish for each.

7am – C Cameras permitted inside courtroom during Jussie Smollett hearing. (PageSix) — Cameras will be allowed inside the courtroom for Jussie Smollett‘s next hearing in Chicago later this week, a judge ruled Tuesday. One still camera and one video camera will be allowed when the “Empire” star appears in court Thursday, Chief Cook County Criminal Courts Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. decided, according to the Chicago Sun Times. Smollett’s trial judge will decide whether cameras can be present for future hearings in the case, he added. Smollett’s attorneys didn’t object to the presence of media in the courtroom, saying there had been a lot of “false information spread” in the case, according to NBC Chicago. The embattled actor — who is accused of filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate crime — attended Tuesday’s hearing, even though his presence was not required in the court. A spokeswoman for Smollett said he wanted to “show up and show respect to the court.” “He wants to hold his head up high, show confidence in his innocence,” Anne Kavanagh told NBC.

7am – D INTERVIEW – MATT ZAPOTOSKY – Washington Post reporter

Matt Zapotosky covers the Justice Department for The Washington Post

FBI accuses wealthy parents, including celebrities, in college-entrance bribery scheme. (Washington Post) — The Justice Department on Tuesday charged 50 people — including two television stars — with participating in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme that enabled privileged students with lackluster grades to attend prestigious colleges and universities. The allegations included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others. In Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBI’s Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged. The scheme was discovered accidentally by the FBI while working an unrelated undercover operation about a year ago, officials said. That tip led to a sprawling, nationwide corruption probe. “These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,” said Lelling. “This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I’ll add there will not be a separate criminal-justice system, either.” No students were charged because prosecutors said their parents were the scheme’s principal actors.

7am – E AOC TAKES ON WELLS FARGO:

Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) asks Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan: “Hypothetically, if there was a leak from the Dakota Access pipeline, why shouldn’t Wells Fargo pay for the clean up of it?” Sloan: “Because we don’t operate the pipeline, we provide financing”

AOC asks Well Fargo why they were involved in caging of children and Wells Fargo is confused.

THE HILL Exclusive: Biden to run for White House, says Dem lawmaker. Former Vice President Joe Biden will run for president in 2020, a senior Democratic lawmaker told The Hill on Tuesday, a move that will shake up the crowded Democratic primary field and make him the clear front-runner for his party’s nomination against President Trump. “I’m giving it a shot,” Biden said matter-of-factly during a phone call with a House Democratic lawmaker within the past week — a conversation the congressman recounted to The Hill and interpreted as a sure sign that Biden will run in 2020. In the brief phone call, the former vice president asked if he could bounce some campaign strategy ideas off the lawmaker and invited the lawmaker to sit down with him in person in the near future. Biden also said he hoped to have the lawmaker’s support, something the lawmaker did not commit to.

8am – B/C INTERVIEW – ADAM KENNEDY – White House Deputy Director of Communications and Deputy Assistant to the President — discussed the National Emergency/border security.

Senate will vote Thursday on bill to block Trump’s national emergency declaration. The Senate will vote Thursday on whether to block President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration, forcing Republicans to decide if they should check the White House’s flex of executive power. The Democratic-held House has already approved a resolution to terminate Trump’s action, which he aims to use to secure $3.6 billion to build his proposed border wall. The GOP-held Senate is expected to pass the measure, as at least four Republicans currently plan to support it. Those four GOP lawmakers joining with 47 Democrats will give the chamber the majority needed to pass it and send it to Trump’s desk. The president has threatened to veto the bill, and both chambers appear not to have the votes to reach the two-thirds majority needed to override Trump.

House Democrats introduce bill to offer 2.5 million immigrants chance at permanent status. (Vox) – The Dream and Promise Act would allow DREAMers to apply for legalization, and TPS holders to apply for green cards. House Democrats are teeing up their next major piece of legislation: an immigration bill that would allow as many as 2.5 million people to apply for legal status and put them on a path that could ultimately lead to US citizenship. The bill, HR 6 — called the Dream and Promise Act — combines the longstanding DREAM Act, a legalization bill for unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as children, with a proposal to allow some immigrants with temporary humanitarian protections to apply for permanent legal status. What unites the two groups of immigrants is that both have put down roots in the US, generally living here for more (sometimes much more) than a decade but without permanent status. “Living with uncertainty has defined most of my 16 years in the United States,” Jessica Garcia, a 21-year-old DACA recipient, said at a press conference Tuesday formally unveiling the bill.

8am – E Trump airs doubts about airplane tech after Boeing crashes. Washington (CNN) Add modern aviation technology to the list of technological advances the President of the United States distrusts. “Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly,” President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger. All this cost for very little gain.” Trump’s tweets come days after a Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane crashed, the second time in months that the new airplane model has wrecked minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. The crashes have raised questions about the role of a new software system installed on the plane, but investigators have yet to reach a conclusion about the cause. The similar circumstances of both crashes have caused several countries and airlines to ground the 737 MAX 8 planes, but despite growing calls from US lawmakers to do the same — and Trump’s tweet on Tuesday morning — the Federal Aviation Administration has yet to follow suit.

Trump’s ‘Ludicrous’ New Tweet Has Chris Cuomo And Don Lemon Laughing And Singing. The CNN hosts taunted the president with a tune. Both Lemon and Cuomo pointed out that flying in the United States had never been safer, thanks to advancing technology. “He knows what he’s doing once again,” Cuomo said. “He is tapping into this fear of the new because people feel they’re being left behind.” Trump’s comments also harken to his “Make America Great Again” slogan. “When were we ever greater than we are today?” Cuomo asked. Then Lemon interrupted him by singing the first line of “Those Were the Days,” the theme song to the hit 1970s TV show “All In The Family.” And Cuomo couldn’t help but sing along"

Also known for effusive praise of the president and for repeatedly claiming that he overheard people in a “hipster coffee shop” praising Trump – at least before he was permanently banned from Twitter – Wohl may find himself in trouble for a more recent stunt.

Wohl, along with fellow right-wing journalist and Twitter exile Laura Loomer, recently visited the Minneapolis area, where they pushed conspiracy theories about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, claimed that they were in physical danger from the area’s Muslim community, and reportedly stated that the city of Minneapolis has “sharia police” and “no-go zones.” To much mockery, Wohl also frequently referenced both a large camera crew and security forces, who were always just off camera.

Now, following the release of a documentary about that Minneapolis visit, a local journalist appears to have caught Wohl committing what may be a crime.

According to the Twitter account of Minneapolis reporter Tony Webster, the documentary contains a screenshot of a tweet that Wohl claims was a death threat that he received while visiting Minneapolis. However, Webster noticed that the avatar in the photo is the same one that Wohl used in a previously made fake account, suggesting that the death threat was not legitimate.

The supposed fake account for “Drake Holmes” spelled “Holmes” wrong in its Twitter handle, as first pointed out by NBC News’ Ben Collins. It was this fake account that led to Wohl’s permanent Twitter banishment in February. It recalled Wohl’s Mueller gambit, in which he created a bogus intelligence firm called “Surefire Intelligence” and gave the company a phone number that traced back to his mother’s cell phone.

Wohl admitted in a USA Today interview, shortly before the banishment, that he was planning to create fake Twitter accounts to manipulate the Democratic primaries in 2020.

In the right-wing ‘documentary’ on Rep. Ilhan Omar released tonight by Jacob Wohl, Laura Loomer, and Ali Alexander, they included this screenshot of a threat they received. There's one problem: NBC News earlier reported that Jacob Wohl created the account which sent the “threat”. pic.twitter.com/phGxZJ7V3I — Tony Webster (@webster) March 13, 2019

Also, in the online documentary, Wohl is shown filing a police report in connection with the “threat,” and the Minneapolis Police Department told Webster that Wohl really did file the report and that the police department recorded their interactions with Wohl.

As demonstrated by the recent Jussie Smollett incident, filing a false police report is the sort of thing that can get someone in a lot of trouble."

The show launches the second half of its 18-episode season the same week that Smollett, who plays the character of Jamal, appeared in court, having been indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly staging an attack on himself and subsequently providing false information to the police.

Smollett has denied the charges. On Tuesday, he attended a hearing regarding whether to allow cameras in the courtroom.

The network has already announced that the actor will be left out of the last two episodes to “avoid further disruption on set,” although it’s unclear how his absence will be explained. That means the seventh hour in this latest run could wind up being his character’s last on the series. The program has yet to be renewed for next season, a decision Fox won’t have to officially make until May.

The producers initially expressed support for Smollett. After he was charged, they called the allegations “disturbing,” saying in a statement that Smollett is “an important member of our ‘Empire’ family,” adding that “we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

As always, “Empire” remains an ensemble show, with the juiciest plots generally reserved for Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard.

Still, Jamal is a major character and has a significant storyline as these new episodes get underway. His relationship with Kai (Toby Onwumere) has placed him between the journalist and his family, in what amounts to a test of his loyalties.

A broader plot focuses on the discovery in the show’s fall cliffhanger that antagonist Jeff Kingsley (A.Z. Kelsey) is also Lucious’ son, presenting the latest challenge to the musical Lyons family dynasty.

Once a major hit, the audience for “Empire” has declined markedly from its heyday; nevertheless, it remains Fox’s second-most-watched drama in key demographics. Per Nielsen data, same-day ratings averaged about 5 million viewers through the first half of the season, which ended in December.

The coverage of Smollett’s case has unfolded during a scheduled hiatus. Fox splits the season into two parts so that the episodes can play without interruption through the spring.

As if the Smollett situation weren’t distraction enough, a screener for the latest episode also contains an off-hand reference to dancing like Michael Jackson during a musical number by Bryshere Y. Gray, who plays Hakeem — a fleeting moment that nevertheless might feel ill-timed in the wake of the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland.”

“Empire” returns March 13 at 8 p.m. on Fox."

One of the many stunts pulled by the accused, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, was having their kids’ SAT answers changed.

The aspect of the college admissions cheating scandal was quite ironic considering earlier this year a Black high school student was interrogated and shamed for improving her SAT score.

Let us remind you. Florida teen Kamilah Campbell was told her test scores were invalid after she improved her original score of 900. Campbell, alongside her lawyer, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, said she felt she was being accused of cheating by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which oversees the SAT.

“I did not cheat,” Campbell said defiantly during a press conference in Miami in January. “I studied, and I focused to achieve my dream. I worked so hard and did everything I could do.”

Crump said in a statement, “ETS violated Kamilah’s constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty and denied Kamilah due process.”

“The family is demanding ETS release her test scores within the next two weeks so that colleges and scholarship committees can appropriately evaluate her applications,” the statement continued. “If not, Crump said the family will move forward with exploring every legal remedy available to give Kamilah the justice she deserves, including but not limited to pursuing litigation on the basis of a violation of her civil rights.”

Campbell said an ETS employee told her that she scored 1230 on her second SAT testing, an improvement of better than 300 points. She got a tutor, “took online classes and she got a copy of a The Princeton Review prep book,” according to a CNN report.

While neither Campbell nor Crump made any reference to race, it was impossible to ignore her being a Black woman, especially now with the current college admissions scandal.

There is a long-lingering SAT achievement gap between Blacks and other races.

“These gaps have a significant impact on life chances, and therefore on the transmission of inequality across generations,” according to research conducted by the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. Campbell was forced to retake the test and, of course, the College Board in Florida will not release her test scores.

It is despicable that rich white people would use their privilege because they didn’t want their kids to work too hard. Then again, that has always been the American way.

The “Empire” actor’s lawyers were pushing for the trial to broadcast live.

“We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” attorney Tina Glandian told reporters.

Smollett was not required to appear in court Tuesday but one of his reps told NBC News that he wanted “to show confidence in his innocence.”

Ultimately, Judge LeRoy Martin, Jr., will decide if cameras will be allowed in the courtroom.

Smollett has maintained his innocence. He has been indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by a grand jury.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this,” Smollett’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, told CNN on Friday. “I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

Geragos called out the Chicago Police Department, too.

“He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report,” Geragos said. “Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

Geragos also challenged the idea that Smollett may have staged an attack because he wanted a higher salary for his “Empire” role.

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money. They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money,” Geragos said. “They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Additionally, Geragos accused the Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool.

Watch the lawyer below:

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo told them the attack was orchestrated by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

In sum:

Appearing on the third hour of NBC's Today show on Tuesday, former Tonight Show host Jay Leno lamented how ""everyone has to know your politics"" now if you're a late-night comedian. He mentioned that he prided himself on not letting viewers know his political views and feared that many comedians have become too ""one-sided"" when it comes to politics.

""It's been five years since you left The Tonight Show, and you see the place we are right now in this country,"" co-host Al Roker noted, wondering: ""Do you miss being on the show, or is it such a different time that it would be hard to do?"" Leno replied: ""No, it's different. I don't miss it. You know, everything now is, if people don't like your politics they — everyone has to know your politics.""

The comedian pointed out that during his tenure at The Tonight Show he followed the lead of his predecessor and ""kind of used Johnny's model"" so that ""people couldn't figure out"" his political leanings. ""I would get hate mail from both sides equally,"" Leno fondly recalled. He declared: ""I went, well, that's fabulous. That's exactly what I want.""

Worrying about the current late-night environment, he warned: ""But when people see you as one-sided, it just makes it tough.""

Leno joked that in his time ""Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb, and it was just a little easier,"" but that ""now it's all very serious."" He added: ""I'd just like to see a bit of civility come back to it, you know?""

Moments later, co-host Sheinelle Jones asked: ""Do you think the pendulum will swing back the other direction?"" Leno predicted it would eventually: ""Oh, of course, I think it will, I think it'll swing back the other way, yeah."" He observed that part of the problem was how obsessed late-night comics are with political news:

Because, you know, the theory when we did the show was you just watch the news, we'll make fun of the news, and get your mind off the news. Well, now people just want to be on the news all the time. You just have one subject that's the same topic every night, which makes it — makes it very hard. I mean, all the comics, Jimmy and Colbert and everybody else, it's tough when that's the only topic out there."

The actor, who starred in the 1999 movie about a high school football team in Texas, crafted the perfect tweet in response to the revelation that the college admissions bribery case was dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" by law enforcement.

""If only there was a succinct turn of phrase these kids could have used to inform their parents they were not desirous of their life path..."" Van Der Beek, 42, cracked Tuesday. The ""Dawson's Creek"" alum appears to be slyly referencing the memorable moment in the film when he tells his father he wants to be the one who determines his own fate.

""Playing football at West Canaan may have been the opportunity of your lifetime,"" Van Der Beek's Mox says, ""but I don't want your life.""

Why I'm ticked off by the college admissions scandal: And why all parents should be

Huffman released on bail:'Desperate Housewives' star pays $250,000, has travel restricted for role in admissions cheating scandal

Tuesday, federal prosecutors charged 33 affluent parents, including CEOs and actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, nine college athletics coaches and others in the sweeping bribery case to enter elite universities and colleges. The elaborate conspiracy involved cheating on the SAT and ACT and parents paying coaches ""enormous sums"" to get their children into schools by fabricating their athletic credentials. A judge has released Huffman on $250,000 bail. Loughlin appeared in court Wednesday and was released on a $1 million bail.

Other celebrities also reacted to the scandal.

""The Predator"" actress Olivia Munn took aim at Loughlin's daughter, Olivia Jade, all without mentioning her name. Olivia Jade runs a popular YouTube channel with nearly 2 million subscribers.

""The irony will be that these parents spent all this money to hustle into top universities and are now in the middle of this (expletive) show just to find out in a few years that their kids only have dreams of being an influencer,"" Munn tweeted Tuesday.

In another tweet, she sarcastically added, ""I went to Harvard to be an Instagrammer."" Munn also included the millennial-esque hashtags, ""#ad #abs #fittea #waisttrainer #fitnessgoals #matchamornings #keto #lchf #superfoodmuffins.""

Comedian and actor Billy Eichner let the world know that he's ""proud to say I got into Northwestern without the help of my mother, Laura Linney.""

For the record, Linney is not Eichner's mother. She's an actress who currently plays crafty Wendy Byrde on Netflix's ""Ozark.""

Samantha Bee, late-night host of ""Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,"" sent an alert to her Twitter followers: ""BREAKING NEWS: ENTRANCE INTO COLLEGE UNJUST, TILTED IN FAVOR OF WHITE KIDS WITH RICH PARENTS.""

""The Real"" host Loni Love used the face-palm emoji to explain her reaction to ""#AuntBecky going to jail on Rico charges."" She included a meme that reads, ""I can't handle people anymore.""

""The King of Queens"" actor Patton Oswalt joked that he ""just paid 425k to get my daughter into a Color Me Mine,"" a pottery studio.

ABC host Chris Harrison marveled at the operation's name. ""This college scandal is really called 'Operation Varsity Blues,'"" he wrote. ""You gotta love the feds have a sense of humor and great taste in movies. Personally I would’ve gone 'Blue Chips'""

Actor/writer Ike Barinholtz felt a certain world's best boss from ""The Office"" might've been behind the name.

“'Operation Varsity Blues' sounds like something Michael Scott cooked up,"" he posted.

Kathy Griffin joked that it was a good day for Jussie Smollett, who Chicago police claim staged an attack in January, a charge he denies.

""Jussie Smollett is having his best day in MONTHS,"" Griffin tweeted, ""#VarsityBlues""

Lena Dunham proposed: ""all the people involved in this college scam should have gathered their money and started a small elite college where Lori Loughlin teaches a class on smiling."" In a follow-up tweet, she said ""My parents didn’t care enough about college to scam but they’d definitely buy me a boyfriend who is willing to sit with me at the ER""

Donald Trump Jr. resurfaced a 2016 tweet from Huffman asking her followers: ""What are your best 'hacks' for the back-to-school season?""

""I’m learning some new ones as we speak,"" Trump Jr. posted. ""Stay tuned.""

If you don’t know, Hugh won a Tony Award for his Broadway debut as Peter Allen in 2003′s The Boy From Oz.

“The first musical I was ever a part of was the phenomenal The Music Man. The year was 1983, and I was at Knox Grammar School in Sydney, Australia. I was one of the traveling salesmen, and I think I can actually (almost) remember that unforgettable opening number!

To finally be doing this is a huge thrill.”

The show will be directed by four-time Tony Award winner Jerry Zaks with choreography by Tony Award winner Warren Carlyle.

A magistrate judge in Los Angeles said the “Desperate Housewives” star could be released as long as she remained inside the United States, according to The Associated Press. She was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud.

Huffman, 56, is accused of paying $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation to enable her elder daughter to cheat on the SAT, which she took in December 2017. Huffman and her husband, actor William H. Macy, who has not been charged, had arranged to do the same for their younger daughter but then allegedly deciding not to.

Huffman opened the door early Tuesday morning to FBI agents who had their guns drawn, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a source familiar with the incident. She spent several hours in federal custody before appearing in court to hear her charges. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told the L.A. Times that the agency did not use a tactical team to arrest the actress but that FBI agents “are armed and may draw their weapons as a precautionary measure.”

Huffman and “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin are two of at least 40 celebrities, executives and athletic officials charged Tuesday in a massive bribery scheme, where prosecutors said wealthy parents paid up to $6 million in bribes to college coaches and workers at testing centers to help their children get admission into elite, selective colleges. Loughlin was not taken into custody Tuesday and, along with her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, is accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California by having them falsely appear as athletic recruits.

William “RIck” Singer, the founder of an admissions consulting company, pleaded guilty Tuesday to running the scheme.

Huffman’s next court date is March 29 in Boston.

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Thursday. During that hearing, the case will be assigned to a trial judge who will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

During the hearing, which was held after local news organizations requested that cameras be allowed in the courtroom, Judge LeRoy Martin, Jr. said that the new judge will decide whether or not to allow cameras in the courtroom during subsequent hearings and the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is “demonstrably false.”

“We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” she said.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct —the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

Smollett’s attorneys have called 16 counts “prosecutorial overkill.” The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence."

Photo by Massimo Percossi/EPA

March 12 (UPI) -- Australian Cardinal George Pell was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison for sexually abusing two choirboys in the 1990s, becoming the most senior Catholic official to be jailed for committing sex crimes against children.

Pell, 77, was convicted late last year by a Melbourne court on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 years of age and four charges of committing an indecent act on children.

The ruling was only announced late last month due to a suppression order.

The former Vatican treasurer and former Papal adviser will spend three years and eight months behind bars before he is eligible for parole for the 1996 crimes, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. He will also be registered for life as a sex offender.

Chief judge Petter Kidd said during sentencing that he was aware that Pell may not outlive his sentence.

""Facing jail at your age in these circumstances must be an awful state of affairs for you,"" Kidd said, the Guardian reported.

Kidd said the sentence must demonstrate ""grave consequences"" of breaking the law and that since Pell maintained his innocence throughout the trial, it would not be reduced as he showed no evidence of ""remorse or contrition."" His crimes, Kidd said, displayed ""staggering arrogance.""

RELATED Chelsea Manning jailed for refusing to answer grand jury

In 1996, Pell, then the Archbishop of Melbourne, had discovered the two choirboys drinking sacramental wine, one of the abused children, now a 35-year-old man, told the jury during the trial last year.

Pell had told the boys that they were in trouble. Then he revealed himself to them and forced one of the boys to perform oral sex on him and then fondled the other, the complainant said. Some time later, the complainant said he was again attacked by Pell who pushed him against a wall, fondled his genitals and then walked away.

The other boy, who never filed a complaint against Pell, died in 2014 from a heroin overdose.

RELATED Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 counts for false police report

""I think you did give thought or reflection to this offending and only reasonable inference from the brazenness of your reoffending is that you had a degree of confidence that the victims would not complain either immediately,"" Kidd said during sentencing, which was broadcast throughout Australia live from a Melbourne country court.

Pell did not seek to silence the children, Kidd said, because he did not feel it was necessary, and his second transgression carried the mark of ""physical aggression and venom.""

Kidd made clear that Pell was not being made a ""scapegoat"" for the Catholic Church's failings and he was being sentenced only for crimes the jury found him guilty of.

Though he didn't shorten the sentence, Kidd said he did impose a shorter non-parole period ""in recognition in particular of your age, so as to increase the prospect of your living out the last part of your life in the community.""

Pell has filed an appeal to be heard June 5."

Hollywood elites are, by definition, in the business of concocting fictional stories. Is it any surprise that they apply these skill sets beyond screen and stage entertainment, where the fiction is acknowledged, and use them to achieve their objectives in realms affecting their personal and political lives? In both the college admissions scandal and the alleged hate crime fraud masterminded (I use the term very loosely) by Jussie Smollett, I find five other common points in addition to the first point of employing fiction:



Winter for the Ruling Class (Yale University; photo credit: Max Pixel). Two: Powerful people from powerful families with no concern for issues of right and wrong tried to accomplish their goals ""by any means necessary."" Religion — the notion the God watches over us and knows when we sin — is regarded as a quaint vestige of the past and a hindrance to achieving necessary ends, both personal and political. Three: Wealth enables payoffs. Most people cannot conceive of lavishing thousands of dollars, much less hundreds of thousands or even millions, on bribes because they earn their money through hard work. But such are the rewards of stardom or business success: once liberated from concerns over morality (see point two), there is no problem in offering whatever it takes ($3,500 for a couple of Nigerian brothers, or millions to a college official) to get the desired behavior. Four: The notion that ""laws are for the little people"" is widespread, from Hillary Clinton's exoneration by James Comey (and, according to the recently released testimony of Lisa Page, the Department of Justice) to state and local level officials who escape mundane concerns such as speed limits. Five: Utter indifference to the victims of their fraud. Jussie Smollett remained silent as the Chicago police investigated possible miscreants, who could well have had their lives ruined if prosecuted for the phony hate crime. I suspect that most of the parents and children admitted to elite schools never once thought about the hardworking kids who did not get the longed for acceptance letters these offenders got through fraud. They matter so little that they don't ever merit consideration when planning the crimes. Six: Despite all of the above, virtue-signaling remains a favorite pastime. Smollett's now infamous interview with Robin Roberts was a nonstop festival of moral preening (as a victim), while at least some of the Hollywood and business elites implicated in the college admissions scandal used their wealth for ""donations"" to a tax-deductible foundation established by the consultant, while others donated directly to the universities. I suspect there are other similarities between the two scandals, because they both reveal that our ruling class is far more corrupt and cynical than most Americans ever realized. Note: I am indebted to my friend Mike Nadler for originally pointing out the comparison between the two scandals. But responsibility for any inadequacies and errors rests solely with me."

it is a strength, not a weakness.

It is always tempting to believe that we live in historic times. It strokes the ego to think that decades from now, people will look back on current events as the starting point of some dramatic, epochal change. As a comedian, professionally cynical and distrustful of epic narratives, I usually dismiss such notions as the delusions of grandeur of an increasingly narcissistic generation. Yet as I sat glued to my computer last week, watching Joe Rogan and Tim Pool interrogate Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and the company's global lead for legal, policy, and trust and safety-Vijaya Gadde-I could not shake the feeling that I was witnessing a historic moment.Our faith in a cadre of well-trained media professionals, able to set aside their biases to report on and analyze the big stories of our age, hasn't just eroded. We no longer have any confidence that such impartiality is possible. Into this breach have stepped the YouTubers and podcasters who clearly and openly state their biases, who do not pretend to be impartial but rather acknowledge their ideological starting points and then seek to have good-faith discussions with people from across the spectrum.More damagingly still, just as the people have lost our faith in the media, the media has also lost faith in us. The average duration of a TV soundbite has shrunk from minutes in the 1960s to a handful of seconds today. The big feet of the media increasingly believe that we are too busy, stupid or, at best, uninterested to pay attention and they have addressed this by feeding us a nauseating diet of informational cocktail sausages when what we really crave is a side of beef.Another distinction between the MSM and new media is the incredible gulf between them in accountability. Rogan spoke to the Twitter CEO only weeks earlier , prompting a fierce backlash from his fans over a lack of preparation and the perception that he pussyfooted around instead of taking Dorsey to task for Twitter's leftist bias and unfair treatment of conservative voices. Unlike the world's leading publications, which frequently cover up or even double down on their failings - the Covington kids story, the Jussie Smollett hoax - Rogan acknowledged his faults and not only invited Twitter executives back, but also brought along an expert to question them.It says something about the shift in the balance of power that the CEO of one of the world's largest tech companies feels the best way to address the concerns of his customers is to appear on Rogan rather than write an opinion piece in a major newspaper or give a TV interview to a network talk show.While Dorsey's and Gadde's answers were not always satisfactory, one of the most powerful moments in the conversation was Gadde admitting that Twitter has room for improvement and thanking Pool for the ""feedback."" Even though her answer was mocked extensively (and hilariously) online, a response of this kind would never have happened on the mainstream media.While Rogan should be commended for creating the space for this conversation and Pool deserves kudos for his tenacious questioning, credit should also go to Dorsey for offering himself and his company up for public scrutiny. The discussion was not perfect and we don't know what effect it will have on Twitter's policies, but conversations like this can reduce the temperature of our increasingly frenzied, polarized politics. We know we can't trust the old media to deliver that soothing balm - let's hope the new media can.Konstantin Kisin is a Russian-British comedian based in the U.K. and the co-host of TRIGGERnometry .

Vikings star Katheryn Winnick is definitely plotting something big, as she has just gone and teased fans with a ‘secret project.’

The actress come director had her followers guessing this week, as she took to her Instagram story with the news.

While sitting in the back of a car, the 41-year-old filmed a boomerang of herself looking up to the camera with a cat filter over her face.

In the caption, she wrote: ‘Oooh the nerves, wish me luck…’ followed by the hashtag ‘secretproject’ and the ‘fingers crossed’ emoji.

Whether or not the project is to do with Vikings is unknown, but after the show’s creator Michael Hirst teased a spin-off, we can’t help but hope that he’s got Katheryn involved.

Chatting to Variety earlier this year, the director spoke about bringing the main show to an end, before giving fans a sneak peek into his next project.

He told the publication: ‘I always knew where I wanted the show to go and more or less where it would end if I was given the opportunity.

The star is clearly plotting something huge (Picture: Instagram / @katherynwinnick)

‘What I was trying to do was write the saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons.’

He continued: ‘After six seasons and 89 episodes, that’s what I felt — finally — I’d done. We stopped shooting the final episode in November last year and I felt that I’d said all I needed to say about Ragnar and his sons.’

But despite taking the saga as far as he felt necessary, the 66-year-old revealed that a spin-off, or ‘continuation’ as he likes to call it, is definitely on its way.

‘Continuation means, that if we make it, it will be connected to my saga,’ Hirst explained. ‘It may not involve necessarily the same characters.’

‘I can’t go into more details than that, but for the fans of the show it will be a continued enjoyment of the Vikings experience.’

We’re hoping she teams up with Michael Hirst again for him Vikings spin-off series (Picture: Instagram / @katherynwinnick)

Despite wrapping up filming in December, Hirst has been in touch with Katheryn as he joined her at the WIN awards where she scooped best actress.

Sharing a picture of herself stood in between Michael and her co-star Georgia Hirst, the actress wrote: ‘What a night!

‘I couldn’t feel more blessed than to celebrate this Best Actress Award with my Vikings creator Michael Hirst and costar @geehirst.’

She later added: ‘Thank you to my amazing team for all the love and support!’

Katheryn’s character in the history saga has been a keen favourite of Michael’s, and we’re hoping the pair continue to work together in his upcoming spin-off series.

Until then, however, we have season six of Vikings to look forward to, which is expected to arrive on the History Channel later this year.

Fresh reports have surfaced claiming Jussie Smollett’s Empire character could be recast or even killed off.

With Jussie facing 16 Class 4 Felony charges for disorderly conduct for filing a false report, his return to the FOX show is up in the air.

Jussie’s character Jamal was written out of the final two episodes of the season in the wake of his arrest for falsifying a police report. And now Empire bosses are said to thinking about their next steps.

Variety reports that ‘many options are on the table’, and it is ‘possible the character could be killed off or the role could be recast’.

Meanwhile Jamal’s part in the remainder of season five is ‘being downplayed’ despite Jamal having a major storyline.

The actor claimed in January that he was the victim of an assault in Chicago with two men allegedly beating him and shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

On Tuesday the 36-year-old attended a court hearing he didn’t need to be present for, walking into the Cook County Courthouse with his team.

According to TMZ the hearing was for his attorney, Mark Geragos, to file the paperwork so he can represent the actor and his case in Illinois. Jussie vehemently denies the charges and will defend the case.

While each charge, if proven, doesn’t potentially mean additional time in prison, each one does carry a maximum probation sentence of four years.

If found guilty, he’s potentially faces a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation.

Jussie has played Jamal Lyon, the middle child of Cookie and Lucious Lyon, on Empire since 2015.

Smollett has previously released his own statement of apology to his Empire co-stars, including Taraji P. Henson and Terence Howard, for ‘putting them through this’ but maintains his innocence.

FOX declined to comment when contacted by Metro.co.uk.

Jeffrey Sanders, the Portland hospital’s former executive vice president and chief operating officer, became president in January. His immediate predecessor, former President and CEO Richard Petersen, remains CEO of the hospital but has taken on a new role as president of its parent organization, MaineHealth.

Sanders has been the point man on Maine Med’s five-year, $534 million expansion plan, which includes a new parking garage on St. John Street and a six-story medical building on Congress Street. That effort included working with neighborhood groups and city officials in Portland to mitigate potential opposition to the project.

In an interview Tuesday, Sanders said he wants to bring that same collaborative mindset to other aspects of the hospital’s mission.

“I think it resulted in a good zoning approach for us that did not result in a lot of backlash, which you sometimes see,” Sanders said. “One of the things I want to build on in my current role is how do we continue to effectively engage the broader community in improving health care.”

Whereas Sanders was deeply involved in the minutiae of Maine Med’s day-to-day operations, he is now taking on a more strategic role. Meanwhile, Petersen will focus more attention on parent company MaineHealth. Maine Med is the state’s largest hospital, and MaineHealth is its largest health care system.

Both executives are well-compensated, with Sanders earning about $639,900 in salary and benefits during Maine Med’s 2018 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, and Petersen earning a total of over $1.3 million. The hospital would not disclose how the recent change in titles has affected their compensation.

Sanders said a real-life example of how collaboration can improve community health care is a joint project between Maine Med and Portland’s Preble Street Resource Center, which provides a variety of services to the city’s homeless population and other at-risk groups.

The hospital opened a clinic across from the nonprofit Preble Street center in early 2017 to provide medical services to Portland’s homeless population. It is staffed by Maine Med personnel in residency, the medical term for on-the-job training.

“Our team that worked on it developed a model that I think is pretty enduring for a good and important access point for the community to access services there,” Sanders said. “It’s also an important training site for our residents.”

Hospitals in Maine are facing a variety of financial challenges that have resulted in relatively high medical costs, particularly at smaller, rural hospitals. One way they have responded is to band together under the umbrellas of large, regional health care systems such as MaineHealth.

Sanders said that as MaineHealth’s largest institution, Maine Medical Center expects to take on an ever-increasing role in providing specialty care to patients throughout the health care system’s expanding territory. MaineHealth recently underwent a process to unify its 10 member organizations, placing them under centralized leadership.

The cost benefits of unification remain to be seen, Sanders said, but it will give smaller hospitals in the MaineHealth system access to resources they would not otherwise have. He added that the recent implementation of Medicaid expansion in Maine also will benefit both patients and health care providers.

Sanders said even a large hospital such as Maine Med – one of the area’s largest employers with a staff of over 7,000 – can’t go it alone when it comes to tackling the challenges of making health care services more accessible and effective.

“It’s easy to get lost inside the walls of the organization,” he said. “It’s important to remember not to, and to engage the community.”

Please vote no on Article 4, which presents the Belgrade Public Library’s proposed budget of $82,094.

The Belgrade community has enjoyed a wonderful resource in the library for many years. Of this, there is no question. There is no criticism of the library’s operation, selections, programs, etc.

However, this budget (nearly double that of 2011) has become excessive. In 2016, a proposal was presented to the Select Board that the library director’s position be made full-time, as the employee had a need for health insurance. That proposal was denied; the town would not put the needs of an individual over limiting taxation of residents for something that is not needed by the town.

However, in 2018, an article to spend an additional $20,990 to make the library director position full-time was put on the ballot and passed by a very slim margin. Concerned residents submitted a petition requesting a re-vote on this full-time/part-time position issue. Not a reversal, but a re-vote. The petition was totally legal with the required number of signatures and submitted in ample time for it to be added to the town warrant. The Select Board rejected the petition; they chose to ignore the request of over 175 registered voters.

This additional expense is for a town of 3,400 residents, with a library building of about 1,900 square feet. As a comparison, Oakland, which has twice as many residents and a much larger library, employs a part-time library director. Other area towns of similar size are open fewer hours — none with a full-time director.

Residents of Belgrade, your vote counts. Please vote on March 15 (or absentee) and defeat this unnecessary expense.

Thankfully, we don’t have the severe problems that folks suffer in the Western states.

June 15, 2017. Silver Lake, Northeast Piscataquis, Maine-- Photo by Jerry Monkman. Jerry Monkman

Every day, 50 million gallons of water full of arsenic, lead and other toxic metals flow from contaminated mining sites into waterways from Montana to California. The contaminated water poisons aquatic life and taints drinking water.

In some places, it’s estimated it will take 1,000 years before this tragedy ends. And the mining companies have no responsibility to clean up their sites, so all efforts to clean this water is funded by taxpayers.

This makes our challenges in Maine seem very doable. Those challenges include keeping invasive plants and fish species out of our waters, and cleaning fishing lures from the bottom of those waters.

I applaud the efforts of so many Mainers who work diligently to keep out or remove invasive plant species from our waters. I’m worried that no similar effort has been made to rid our waters of invasive fish, many of which were stocked illegally.

My favorite local lake, which was once one of Maine’s best landlocked salmon waters, is now full of nine kinds of invasive fish, dominated by northern pike. And the salmon are gone. Very sad.

Our house is bordered by a lake, brook, pond and stream — and all are very special places where I’ve spent a lot of time fishing. But it really bothered me last summer when the brook and stream stopped flowing for about six weeks; that had not happened in our 40 years here.

The stream is home to everything from snapping turtle and water snakes to beaver, otters, fishers, muskrats, lots of ducks, and more. It’s a wild kingdom! My office and desk overlook the stream, and it’s always entertaining to look up from what I am writing to see what’s in the stream.

I’m assuming that the no-flow is going to be a growing problem because of the changing climate — yet another thing we really must take seriously.

Sen. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, sponsored legislation this session to require biodegradable rubber fishing lures for freshwater fishing. His bill would also ban stainless steel hooks. The bill would allow five years to achieve his goal. Lots of fish are ingesting these rubber and other lures and sinkers.

Cameron Patterson, a college student from Oakland, testified in favor of the bill with a great story. As his Eagle Scout project, Cameron decided to clean up the bottom of Tricky Pond in Naples. Tricky Pond had already been awarded the title of “Cleanest Body of Water in Maine,” which makes Cameron’s project even more amazing.

With help and guidance from the Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, and participation by a bunch of scouts, Cameron cleaned 22 pounds of fishing lures and sinkers from the bottom of a one-mile section of the pond. Imagine how much fishing gear could be in other lakes and ponds if the cleanest water in Maine has this much!

Many years ago, the Legislature debated — for two sessions — a ban on lead sinkers proposed by Maine Audubon. On behalf of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, I opposed the bill in the first session, and we defeated it.

But two years later, when Audubon proposed the ban again, we supported it, recognizing that there were plenty of good alternatives to lead sinkers. One thing that changed my mind was the death of a loon in the lake behind my house after the loon ingested a lead sinker. We got the loon to Avian Haven, but they could not save it.

I also remember, at the hearing on the lead sinker bill, a guy offered photos of a popular fishing spot where the lake bottom was covered in lures and sinkers.

We need to launch a statewide project to clean our lakes and ponds of lures and sinkers. Perhaps our lake associations and hunting or fishing clubs can take the lead on this. We also need the industry to step up with more biodegradable lures.

And just in case you want to celebrate Maine’s clean waters, please consider this. Freshly caught freshwater fish may be delicious but we are warned not to overindulge because of mercury, dioxin, DDT and PCBs that can be found in Maine waters. The state advises against eating more than quite small amounts; pregnant women are told not to eat any fish.

Yes, we are blessed with lots of beautiful waters. Let’s do everything we can to make them cleaner and keep them beautiful.

Isaacs, a Maine artist who paints lively and wildly colorful landscapes, is resisting the effects of a creeping brain disease that has diminished his energy and mobility, and accepted a commission to paint the world’s tallest peak. He and his wife, Donna, will head to the Himalayas on Monday so Isaacs can make what likely will be his grandest painting of all. A private collector is paying all his expenses for an 8-by-8-foot oil painting of Mount Everest for a vacant wall in her Vermont home.

‘TRAVEL NOTES’ Henry Isaacs will discuss his paintings and the book “Travel Notes” with author Daniel Kany at 1 p.m. Saturday at Greenhut Galleries, at 146 Middle St. in Portland. Greenhut is showing his exhibition of the same name through March 30.

Despite the uncertainties and challenges of his voyage, Isaacs sees it as an opportunity he cannot pass up. He admits to feeling terrified about his trip, and says members of his family, including his grandkids, have urged him not to go. It’s not worth the risk, they say. What if something happens?

“It’s something I sort of have to do. I just know that to decline the commission would be wrong. It would be arrogant to decline,” he said. “How could I turn it down, even though I am not particularly well? What am I going to do? Wait until I am 80? I am 68. Who is going to ask me again?”

If his journey goes as planned, it will be one among many remarkable adventures of his life. His father was friends with the abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock, whose paintings often hung in the Isaacs’ home before they ended up in world-class museums. He was studio mates with Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz of the rock band the Talking Heads when they were students at the Rhode Island School of Design, and he’s taught art across the world, including in Cuba during the height of the Cold War when he arranged an academic artist exchange program.

“Henry has always been a very adventurous artist,” said Dennis Gleason of Gleason Fine Art in Boothbay Harbor. “He was in Cuba before it was really possible to go there, he’s painted in Rwanda and South Africa. He’s been willing to go wherever the spirit takes him.”

He and Donna will fly into Kathmandu and work their way, with the help of local guides, to various vantage points that are about 50 miles from Everest. He expects to view the mountain, which tops out at a little more 29,000 feet, from an elevation of about 12,000 feet along ridge lines that offer the expansive views of the mountain that he seeks.

Isaacs will travel with a wheelchair, and hopes he can get by with his cane. “Nepal is not going to be handicapped accessible, so I won’t have a choice,” he said. “I can walk about a kilometer with a cane, if I rest. Maybe a kilometer and a half. I’ll go slowly.”

Related Henry Isaacs channels an early influence as he settles into life in Portland

There are several locations where he thinks he will go, but until he arrives and gets a sense of the geography, he really doesn’t know what to expect. He and Donna are building enough time in their schedule to allow for the uncertainty of the weather and his energy. They are planning to spend at least five weeks.

His client, who has asked to remain anonymous and declined to talk about the commission, is a mountain climber and outdoor adventure enthusiast. She has given Isaacs broad discretion with this painting. Her primary request is that the piece reflects a clear view of the mountain.

Gleason said he will worry about his friend on this trip – and he trusts his judgment. “I am a little concerned for him health-wise, given the elevation. But I am sure he will make the best of it,” Gleason said.

Wherever he paints, from the sands of Scarborough to the volcanic ash of Guatemala or the plains of Africa, Isaacs travels with a small backpack and several small panels, brushes and a few tubes of paint. He sits for a while and records his sensory responses to his surroundings with quick, tiny brush strokes that measure time, reflect color and convey movement and emotion. When he returns to his studio, he treats those painted sketches as notes, or snapshots, and translates them into much larger finished paintings.

That will be his approach with the Everest project. “At different times of day, we could have different kinds of light, so my way of working might be just perfect, to have different surface sizes, from very tiny, where I might have 2 inches where I have to work quickly, to 18 or 20 inches for a day where I have six or eight hours,” he said.

Those long work days are becoming less frequent. Lately, he has the stamina for an hour or two of work at a time.

Isaacs began feeling unwell in October 2017. He and Donna were hiking in Cape Breton, and he became dizzy and disoriented. He couldn’t move his right leg, which suddenly lacked sensation. He sat to rest and waited for the feeling to pass. It did, enough for him to walk back on his own power.

But he knew something was wrong, and the medical investigation into his condition began when the couple returned to Portland. Isaacs is being treated by the neurology department at Maine Medical Center. He said his doctors cannot pinpoint his condition, but they believe it is in the family of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s. He’s also lost confidence in his judgment, and surrendered his car keys after he turned the wrong way onto High Street in Portland.

Because of his illness, Isaacs is approaching his work with urgency. Fearful of losing his ability to create the sweeping, gestural paintings as he has done for most of the past 40 years, the Portland painter is working furiously to get as many projects done while he still can. In addition to preparing for his five-week trip to Nepal, he’s also just opened an exhibition of 45 small paintings from his travels, called “Travel Notes,” at Greenhut Galleries in Portland, and also published a small book of the same name recounting his life and painting adventures. Daniel Kany, a freelance art critic for the Maine Sunday Telegram, wrote the book.

Isaacs will discuss his work at 1 p.m. Saturday at Greenhut, two days before he leaves for Nepal.

In preparation for this trip, Isaacs has been studying artists who have painted Everest and has come to admire to a semi-obscure Russian painter named Nicholas Roerich, who in addition to making many treks through Tibet and Nepal in the early part of the 20th century, also painted on Monhegan off the Maine coast.

Born in Chicago, Isaacs has lived in many places, including England and Italy. He grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and considers Vermont his home.

But Maine is his base. He and Donna spent many years on Little Cranberry Island, where they championed the career of and watched over their longtime friend, the artist Ashley Bryan. The Isaacses recently put their Portland home and studio on the real estate market because he needs a more compatible living situation given his unstable physical condition, but they will stay in Portland, where his medical care is based.

When he comes back from Mount Everest, he will be an artist-in-residence at Cove Street Arts, a new community arts center in East Bayside owned by Kelley Lehr and John Danos, who also own Greenhut. There, in a large open studio, he will begin the process of turning what likely will be hundreds of painted notes of Everest into a single cohesive painting.

Doctors scan Isaacs’s brain every few months for signs of change. He wishes he had a prognosis and wishes he knew what was coming next, but accepts the uncertainty of his circumstances.

That uncertainty has helped fuel his motivation to keep working.

“Things are slowly deteriorating, but nothing too dramatic,” he said. “At the moment, knock on wood, I am pretty lucky. Lately, I am having more good days than bad. Fatigue and pain are my biggest enemies, but I am blessed with a lot of friends who have a lot of patience.”

His symptoms have leveled off to the point that Isaacs feels comfortable with what will be a journey of a lifetime to a place he’s always dreamed of going to paint a mountain that has tempted and eluded many artists over time, just as it has thwarted many ambitious climbers.

And as challenging as the trip to Nepal will be, Isaacs will face a larger challenge when he comes home. He has to make the painting.

The ad for Central Mainers to buy silver is misleading at best. Many people watch the precious metals markets but don’t truly understand the actual buying and selling of metals. This ad makes it seem that these “limited edition” silver bars are a good deal, and are likely to become a hedge against inflation.

The fine print of this sales ad reveals that buying 10 of their bars costs $290, for 5 troy ounces of weight. Meaning the purchaser receives silver bars that cost $58 EACH.

Currently, raw pure silver is $15.84 per ounce. I’m a retail jeweler that regularly deals in similar metals. We sell bars like this for $3 over spot price. Therefore, a 1 oz. bar would cost under $19 per ounce — $19 vs. $58.

And there is no collectible value to these, other than the Maine logo being stamped on them. Nobody will buy these back for more than spot price.

Buyer beware, and the newspapers should not accept these kinds of ads.

I am writing in support of Article 11 — the new park called the Belgrade Village Green.

A generous local couple purchased the triangular piece of land where Route 27 meets the West Road and are transforming it into a beautiful park. This new Belgrade Village Green creates a great entrance to the southern end of the Village. And the classic gazebo, stone sitting wall and walking path blend with the landscape and encourage people to slow down, relax and enjoy the sense of the Village.

Now the voters of Belgrade must vote to accept this gift at the upcoming vote. There is no cost to taxpayers for the land, gazebo, wall or landscaping; they have already been paid for. Minimal annual maintenance costs are budgeted at $1,040 for mowing, electrical usage and the well — that’s 35 cents per taxpayer. It’s truly a gift — free and clear — that will become a treasured Belgrade landmark.

Please join me in voting yes on March 15 to accept the new park. Support this valuable addition to the Village by voting yes for the Belgrade Village Green.

I’m asking everyone in Pittston and all the other member communities to please join me in supporting the library. It really is a beautiful, professionally staffed library. More and more Pittston residents of all ages are using its many services. Let’s keep it going.

Over the past year, the number of library cards issued to Pittston residents increased by 8 percent, from 837 to 907, according to an information sheet Gardiner Public Library Director Anne Davis provided in January to the Pittston Selectboard and Budget Committee. Those 70 new library cardholders from Pittston include adults (33), young adults (14) and children (25). Anyone who lives in Pittston can get a library card; just stop by the library and request one.

From Oct. 31, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2018, adult circulation among Pittston cardholders climbed by 6 percent, from 6,716 items to 7,110 items. Teen circulation nearly quadrupled, from 78 to 302. Children’s circulation increased by 14 percent, from 414 to 470.

In addition, the Gardiner Public Library staff regularly delivers books to the Pittston-Randolph School for all schoolchildren to use. This is a great example of the library supporting the school. Plus the library’s Community Archives Room has a professional librarian to help Pittston residents research local history or genealogy.

This year, Pittston’s share for the library is $24,573.50 That’s an incredible deal considering it provides Pittston residents access to a library with an annual budget of over $500,000. The Pittston Town Meeting starts at 9:45 a.m. Saturday, March 16, at Pittston-Randolph School. Please join me in voting yes for the library.

I suppose we put up with the smell and commotion because we felt it was worth it. However, we didn’t realize we gave up more than we bargained for.

Today, the tannery is barely holding on. It has gone through bankruptcy and in the process burdened the town with a hazardous waste dump and a huge tax burden.

Until 2016, the town only took its own waste. In 2016, the town received approval to dispose of “special wastes” on an ongoing basis (from other towns), including paper mill sludge, construction and demolition debris, auto-fluff and sludge. Have you heard of sludge before? It is the sometimes solid, sometimes liquid material generated from wastewater treatment plants, and it contains pollutants, such as heavy metals, dioxins and other toxic chemicals, as well as pathogens like human germs, bacteria, viruses and parasites — and it reeks.

People who live in close proximity to the landfill have been exposed to horrendous odors and huge dust plumes. On many days, we can’t even be outside.

Chapter 400 of the Maine regulations requires that “fugitive dust and nuisance odors from the landfill be controlled.” But yet, despite over 100 documented complaints since April 2018, they are still allowed to operate in violation of the law.

Since 1977, the state has granted variances, one of which was to be able to have the landfill located within 1,000 feet of a residence. Hartland is the only municipally owned sludge landfill in the state that has houses that close to it.

Wake up Hartland — we are putting our community at risk. The landfill and its out-of-town sludge and waste are not worth the cost to our health and quality of life.

The “Empire” star who has been laying low since his arrest for allegedly filing a false police report was seen walking confidently into a Cook County Courthouse for a hearing he did not have to attend.

The hearing is meant for his lawyer, Mark Geragos, to file the paperwork so he can represent Smollett in Illinois and also to determine if cameras will be allowed in court for the case.

It is gathered that Smollett chose to attend because he intends to be an active participant in his defense and not just an observer.

This appearance is the first time Smollett has been sighted after the grand jury handed him a 16 count indictment last week.

On the indictment, Geragos had told celebrity gossip site, TMZ,

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.”"

Smollett, 36, was indicted on 16 counts last week over claims that he lied about being attacked in a racist hate crime on January 29. He had initially told police that two men yelled slurs at him before beating him and leaving a noose around his neck as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in the middle of the night. Police arrested two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, last month over the alleged attack, but released them without charges days later; shortly afterward, authorities accused Smollett of hiring the two men to help stage a fake attack, all in an effort to strengthen his career.

Gloria Schmidt, attorney for the Osundairo brothers, told CBS News on Monday that her clients feel Smollett “betrayed” them and that they are “tremendously regretful” for their involvement in the incident.

“All the other peripherals are outside of their main focus right now, which is to, you know, pick up the pieces of what this has done to their lives and to try to make this something positive, try to make something positive for them and have a positive impact on the community,” she said.

Schmidt said that the two brothers did not commit a hate crime, and confirmed that neither party is facing charges in the case. Their mistake was trusting the “wrong person,” Schmidt said.

“What I can tell you is, primarily, that this entire thing started because they put their trust in the wrong person. Everyone wants to know, well, 'At what time did they get detained,' or 'Was it at customs at O’Hare [Airport]?' Listen, this started way before that,” she said. “You have someone here who is a celebrity type, someone who is in a position of trust, someone who works with these people, someone who’s able to help their careers if he so wants to, and he betrays them. So, the impact that this has had, not only on them but on minority populations, that weighs very heavily on them.”

Chicago police claimed during a press conference last month that Smollett staged the attack because he was not happy with his current salary. However, Smollett has maintained his innocence amid a flurry of backlash, with his attorney Mark Geragos telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday that police never spoke to anyone at 20th Century Fox about Smollett’s alleged dissatisfaction with his “Empire” salary. Geragos contends that Smollett is, in fact, a “victim of a hate crime,” and has also become a victim of a “media gangbang.”

“I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume he’s guilty,” he said.

Smollett, after initially being charged with filing a false police report, was indicted last week on 16 felony counts, in accordance to the number of lies authorities believe he told to police, according to legal analyst Irv Miller, with Chicago’s CBS 2.

“If you have a crime, and that crime has multiple parts to it, you charge all those separate parts,” he explained.

Smollett, who Miller says faces anything from probation to three years in prison if convicted, is scheduled to appear in court for his arraignment on March 14, the outlet reports."

The stunt Jussie Smollett (allegedly) pulled may cost him not only his own job but also jobs for the entire Empire cast and crew.

According to TMZ, Fox has yet to renew “Empire” for a sixth season, which has left actors and crew members wondering whether the show is facing cancellation.

Production sources have reportedly said that “anxiety is high” over the delay because several other Fox shows have already been told whether they will be renewed or canceled.

TMZ reports:

We’re told people who’ve been working on the show for years are griping they should’ve heard the news one way or another by now, and expected to get word on the fate of the show around 2 weeks ago. For the record … Fox has typically renewed the show in January … 5 months ahead of the season finale. The exception … this past season. Fox waited until a few weeks before the season 4 finale was set to air … in May. We’re told folks involved in the production feel like Jussie and his case will be a big factor in how things shake out. As for how Jussie’s character is being handled on the show now … Lee Daniels and co. have already announced Jamal is being removed from the final two episodes of season 5, which is set to return from a hiatus on Wednesday night. Our sources say Jussie’s character will be “out of the country.” Here’s the kicker … our production sources tell us even if Fox does renew the show, higher-ups have expressed serious reservations about Jussie returning … as have many folks on the cast and crew … even some who have publicly supported him.

For what it’s worth, Empire’s ratings have dropped tremendously since season one, which had an average viewership of 10-17 million. Now, only about 5-6 million people tune in weekly.

Of course, the stigma from the Jussie Smollett scandal probably isn’t helping either, which has now put Fox execs—who initially supported Jussie—in a very awkward position.

Smollett claimed on January 29th that he was assaulted by two masked men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him. The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, also said his attackers poured a chemical substance he believed to be bleach on him, and also put a noose around his neck.

He was initially charged last month with one Class 4 felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, but just last week, a Chicago grand jury hit him with an additional 15 counts of the same charge in an 86-page indictment.

Each new charge doesn’t pose any additional prison time but carries a maximum probation sentence of four years.

Smollett now faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison or probation and a $25,000 fine.

Chicago police said Jussie allegedly staged the attack because he was unhappy with his Empire salary."

Re: ""Do Democrats care about stopping crime? Ill-fated attempt to stop border emergency declaration calls priorities into question,"" Monday Viewpoints.

The Dallas Morning News finally published the truth about the national emergency at our southern border. The harm to our country is ignored by the Democrats because President Donald Trump is trying to do something beneficial for our country. The Democrats cannot tolerate any success by Trump, even if it is in the best interest of the United States.

There is a dire emergency. Illegal immigration costs U.S. citizens billions a year. This year ICE anticipates that three times the normal number will be crossing illegally. Thousands are in detention centers, over 2,000 are quarantined and, from what I can tell, only a fraction of the asylum-seekers have a legitimate claim. Already, more than 11 million illegal immigrants are here. I haven't mentioned drugs or human smuggling. Something has to be done. A wall is just a start.

Jack C. Myers, North Dallas

No space for nonsense

I was shocked to see half of the editorial page devoted to the viewpoint, ""Do Democrats care about stopping crime?"" I thought I had stumbled on to Fox News in print. The arguments made by this writer, namely that illegal immigrants drive up the crime rate, is a bold-faced lie. The facts say otherwise. Studies show that the crime rate among that group is much lower than the native-born Americans. The most accurate study, done right here in Texas, puts the rate at 56 percent lower.

Then I noticed the article's author: She is an adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign. She even uses Breitbart as a source for this nonsense. No surprise there. The surprise is that The News would give space to administration propaganda that has been shown to be patently false. Trump tried this approach in January and the fact-checkers ripped him apart.

Stop trying to scare us into supporting Trump's vanity wall. I've yet to hear from anyone who is close to the situation who thinks the wall is the answer. Let's put that money into fixing a system that makes immigrants wait years to enter our country legally. And please show a bit more integrity and refuse to print columns based on ""alternative facts.""

Satire and slants

Re: ""No laughing matter — Satire dies when presidential politics become a farce. Sad!"" by Mehnaaz Momen, Sunday Points.

By not looking beyond the typical bashing of President Donald Trump, Momen neglects perfect examples to make her points on where satire has gone. She says the superiority mode focuses on revealing fraudulent behavior. Look at the media's initial reactions to Jussie Smollett's claims of an attack or the Nicholas Sandmann Lincoln Memorial confrontation. The media immediately went on the attack when they saw MAGA hats, but no one talks about their slanted reporting.

Momen also says that when something is so incongruous, there is no need to compare it to the absurd. How else can the Green New Deal be described other than laughably absurd, and with liberals pushing and shoving to line up behind it? Today's politics would be hilarious if it wasn't so true

Tom Chambers, Plano

Ignoring citizens is unacceptable

There is no better example of how Mike Rawlings and the Dallas City Council completely disregard what the citizens and neighborhoods want than this Methodist Hospital rezoning mess. For them to not heed the city attorney's advice and break their own rules is beyond unacceptable. I hope that everyone in Dallas sees this for what it is. The council's decision has now led to another lawsuit which is an added expense for the city. Not to mention the fact that it seems the council feels above its own law. It was obvious to everyone in attendance at the meeting last month that the Methodist Hospital agenda would be rammed through in whatever manner it took.

For anyone who votes, please make yourself aware of who your council person represents, because in many cases, it is not us, the constituents.

Griggs brings experience

I support Scott Griggs for mayor of Dallas. My reasons are very simple. I have known Griggs and his family for 17 years. He is honest, intelligent and hard-working. He has concrete plans for improving our city that are the result of his years of service. Through his work on the Dallas City Council, Griggs has saved the city of Dallas billions of dollars. His record of service goes well beyond his eight years on the Dallas City Council.

I have also had the opportunity to look into the other candidates. None has significant experience in city government. All would face a steep learning curve if elected.

When the campaign started, Griggs set out his plans at campaign events and candidate forums. At future candidate forums, an odd pattern developed. Some of the candidates began to sound like Griggs as they incorporated his ideas into their campaign platform. Why accept copycats? Support Griggs.

JT's Pilgrimage fest hoping for dry days

After rain and lightning caused a cancellation last year, the Pilgrimage Music and Cultural Festival is hoping for a rebound in its fifth year with headliners The Foo Fighters, The Killers and Keith Urban.

The festival, which is co-produced by Justin Timberlake, is returning to a park in Franklin, Tenn., about 20 miles south of Nashville, on Sept. 21-22. Severe weather last year resulted in evacuations and refunded tickets.

Most of the scheduled headliners last year, including Dave Matthews, didn't perform.

Additional performers this year include Leon Bridges, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, The Head & The Heart, Live, Jenny Lewis, Lauren Daigle, Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real.

Smollett laywer OK with court cameras

A lawyer for Jussie Smollett said Tuesday that she would welcome cameras in the courtroom during the ""Empire"" actor's trial on charges accusing him of lying to the police, saying there has been a lot of leaked misinformation and cameras would allow the public to ""see the evidence and the lack thereof.""

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday. During that hearing, the case will be assigned to a trial judge who will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea.

Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. said Tuesday the new judge will decide whether to allow cameras in the courtroom during hearings and the trial.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

The actor maintains his innocence.

Hawking's nurse barred from the job

British regulators on Tuesday barred one of Stephen Hawking's former nurses from practicing after finding she failed to provide appropriate care to the late physicist.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council struck off Patricia Dowdy, 61, who faced multiple misconduct charges, including financial misconduct, dishonesty, not providing appropriate care, failing to cooperate with the council and not having the correct qualifications.

Dowdy worked for Hawking between 1999 and 2004 and again from July 2013 until being handed an interim suspension in March 2016.

""The panel has found Mrs. Dowdy failed to provide the standards of good, professional care that we expect and Professor Hawking deserved,"" said Matthew McClelland of the council. ""As a result, Mrs. Dowdy will no longer be able to practice.""

The best-known theoretical physicist of his time, Hawking wrote so plainly about the mysteries of space, time and black holes that his book ""A Brief History of Time"" became an international best-seller.

Though suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, Hawking stunned doctors by living with the normally fatal illness for more than 50 years. Hawking died a year ago at the age of 76.

Hawking's family thanked the council after the verdict.

Colb'],https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shutterstock_448997113.jpg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,"['narrative', 'unarmed', 'way', 'case', 'shooting', 'look', 'truth', 'clark', 'telling', 'officers', 'power', 'narratives']","In recent weeks, after an independent investigation, California’s Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, decided not to file charges against two police officers who shot and killed 22-year old Stephon Clark. Prior to Becerra’s decision, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert had made the same choice. We know only a little about the case, that Clark was an unarmed African American man who was holding a cell phone, not a gun, when he died, and that the officers say they believed it was a gun. Controversy continues to swirl around the question whether Officers Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet reasonably feared that Clark posed a serious threat to them at the time that they killed him. When we lack the morally salient facts about what took place in a highly charged situation, we tend to gravitate toward the narratives that confirm our view of the world. In this column, I will consider how such narratives might have shaped public reactions to the use of deadly force against Clark and the decision not to prosecute the police involved.

The “Blue Lives Matter” Narrative

One way to look at the case of Mercadal and Robinet shooting Clark is to identify with the two officers and appreciate the fact that police have a very hard and dangerous job to do and must make split-second judgments in the field while vulnerable to lethal attack. Most police officers, we might observe, are decent people trying to do the right thing by keeping civilians safe from violent crime. We can best understand misbehavior like racial profiling, use of excessive force, and perjury, on such an approach, as the work of a few bad apples.

If we look at the Clark shooting through this narrative lens, then we will conclude that the police officers acted in self-defense under the reasonable belief that their lives were in danger. Though Clark was unarmed at the time, the police had good reason to believe that he had a weapon, because he was holding a dark cell phone, and it was late evening and difficult to see. Working through this filter, we might also say that in the absence of independent information suggesting that these two police officers are racist, reckless, or violent, we should presume that they used deadly force because they reasonably believed that they needed to do so. We do not judge people by what turns out to have been the case (Clark was unarmed) but by what someone reasonably could have thought at the time. Why not give the two officers the benefit of the doubt?

The “Black Lives Matter” Narrative

A second way to look at the case is to observe that our country has yet to reckon with its history of racial persecution and oppression, starting with the Middle Passage and the enslavement of Africans and their descendants and continuing on to lynch mobs, Black Codes, Jim Crow, and ongoing prejudice. People who take the Implicit Attitude Test tend to reveal negative associations with images of black people and positive associations with images of white people. This tells us that racial animus lives. Accordingly, when we hear about police officers killing a black civilian, the logical inference is that racism played an important role and that the shooting was unjustified. Indeed, the victim in this case, Stephon Clark, was unarmed at the time, so how could it have been justified? Within this narrative, people have rightly been protesting the decision to allow the killing to go unpunished and not even to prosecute it.

Narratives

Each narrative has elements of truth to it, and both are somewhat incomplete, as a narrative will necessarily be. We’re always dealing with human beings in these narratives, and humans have a way of departing from people’s expectations. Stereotypes can infect both narratives, putting aside the question of which one conforms better to statistical truth.

The first filter produces a narrative that barely acknowledges the possibility that two police officers who shot an unarmed man might have been doing something wrong at the time. The first narrative thus treats the police as nearly beyond reproach, and it therefore predictably alienates anyone with questions or doubts about the events in question.

The filter that produces the second narrative, meanwhile, may seem to treat police as just a band of racists who routinely bully people of color with shows of authority and physical force. Within this narrative, it becomes hard to process the possibility that removing police from the neighborhoods they patrol—treating them as an affliction on the African American community—may have a deleterious effect on the rate of serious crimes.

Within this narrative, it may also be difficult to absorb the fact that one of the two police officers involved was himself African American, a plot point that at least complicates the racist-murderers narrative. Police are complex people, and a story of black-and-white/good-and-evil could disserve the very population that needs both the assistance of police and a respectful and non-racist mode of policing.

It is not easy to get away from our narratives. During the recent Jussie Smollett apparent hoax, I recall at least one commentator saying that she hoped Smollett was telling the truth. For those who did not hear about it, Empire actor Jussie Smollett came forward to report a hate crime in downtown Chicago; he said that when he was out buying food from a Subway restaurant, he was attacked by two men calling him a racial slur and declaring that he was in MAGA country. They allegedly put a rope on him and poured an unknown liquid on him as well. As it turned out, Smollett appeared to have paid people to pretend to commit the hate crime.

Why in the world would anyone hope that he was telling the truth? How awful would it be if in downtown Chicago, of all places, during extremely cold temperatures (which tend to deter violent crime), an African American man could not leave his house to buy a sandwich without falling prey to white supremacists prepared to do violence?

Put aside some of the implausible features of the story and assume that it is as internally coherent as any other account of a crime. It is telling, I think, that anyone would say that she hoped it was true.

Imagine someone you cared about telling you over the phone that he is bleeding to death. Would you hope that it was true? Probably not, because you are more concerned about the wellbeing of your friend than you are about reinforcing a narrative. Narratives are dangerous when they become more important to us than the truth, and when we find ourselves prioritizing the narrative over the wellbeing of the person falling victim to the designated “bad guy” in the story. Think of how you feel when you read a novel or see a film in which the ending disappoints you. It is easy to start thinking about real-life stories in the same way and insist on the ending that “works” even when it fails to match the facts.

Here is the mindset to which I refer, and I am describing my own thinking at times: I care very much about this cause. Take, for example, the cause of women coming forward with an account of having been sexually assaulted. Then, in a particular case, facts emerge that reduce the credibility of either the complainant or the story that she is telling, or perhaps the accused offers a highly credible and exonerating account of his own actions. I can very much imagine thinking, “I really hope she is not lying. It would look awful for the cause if she were lying.”

I wonder whether it would even have occurred to me when occupying this mindset to think in such a case that if she were lying and if the lie were to surface, then that would mean that (a) no one sexually assaulted her, so she needn’t contend with that trauma; and (b) the man she accused did not actually commit the violent sexual crime. Both of these outcomes are positive, but a fixation on the narrative can prevent us from even seeing that. It is a bit like a doctor I know who predicted that his patient had a particular (very bad) disease. When the tests showed that the patient indeed had this disease, the doctor could not conceal his delight. His narrative of himself as the great diagnostician was more important to him than the health and wellbeing of his patient.

I’ll end with a narrative that has, almost inexplicably, become very important to many people, the tale of Kitty Genovese. Her story is tragic. In the mid-1960s, she was murdered near her apartment building in Queens. The popular narrative has it that she cried out for help repeatedly, leading people in the building to look out of their windows. Those same people, however, reportedly turned off their lights and did nothing to summon police or other emergency assistance.

Social psychologists subsequently developed a theory to explain the “bystander effect” that led 38 people to fail to call for help. The problem with the story is that it didn’t happen that way at all. All but two of the witnesses who heard Genovese’s cries had called the police. Once the massive indifference story got out, though, it was too good to let go. Were New Yorkers just cold and callous people, indifferent to the suffering of strangers? Or was it something about people more generally? Even now, some will talk about Kitty Genovese and seem incapable of processing the truth. Ironically, the truth there may have been linked to police misconduct leading to an innocent person’s death. If we pay attention to the facts and feel less wedded to our narratives, we may be better able to deal with and sometimes even prevent future hardship."

The Iowa caucuses are just one month away. There’s still an unwieldy pack of Democratic candidates, but several have dropped out after realizing that you actually need political talents and a message to run for president. In the home stretch, only four or five Democrats have a real shot to win Iowa or New Hampshire. The candidates and the media are bouncing from town to town, stuffing their bloated campaign-trail bodies into bulky winter coats, dutifully meeting future caucusgoers in cafes and Pizza Ranches. Every reporter is searching hopelessly for an outlet to plug in their phone. After the latest packed campaign event at a brewpub in Waterloo with decent Yelp reviews, political reporters swarm one of the Democratic front-runners for a media avail, eager for a response to Donald Trump’s latest tweet about Don Lemon. Into the scrum steps a mischievous reporter from a troll-y conservative news site. He asks the candidate a cheeky question invented out of thin air: “Senator, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just tweeted that the government should add a 10 percent tax on John Deere tractors in an effort to fight carbon emissions from farms and transition into a new hybrid tractor market. What do you think of that?”

Ocasio-Cortez has not said such a thing and likely won’t. But she and her legions of online supporters have become, in a matter of months, the de facto weather vane for progressive sentiment. So what are the chances this Democratic candidate in Iowa, baited by a Breitbart bro with a fake A.O.C. policy proposal, endorses this made-up idea on the spot, in that brewpub in Waterloo? As depressing as it sounds, there’s a small but realistic chance this fiction would actually come to life. Ideas that once seemed out-of-bounds are now creeping into the mainstream of Democratic politics, with social media acting as the accelerant. Democrats, in the rush to appease the noisiest voices on the Internet and grab onto any gust of fleeting attention, so far have shown they’re willing to jump on a bandwagon of ideas that Barack Obama would never have endorsed on his way to winning two presidential elections: backing reparations, abolishing ICE, getting rid of the Electoral College, running away from the word “capitalism.” As The New York Times put it on Tuesday, “activists are leveraging the early stages of the Democratic primary, creating pseudo-litmus tests for candidates eager to respond to the energy that is driving more extreme policy proposals.”

These “extreme” litmus tests get re-tweeted online with emoji claps from activists (and journalists whose reporting often veers into activism). Many of those same people point to polls showing that progressive momentum is on their side: a survey last week from the Des Moines Register showed that “more than half of likely 2020 Democratic caucusgoers [in Iowa] say they would be satisfied with a presidential candidate who wants the U.S. to be more socialist.” Times have certainly changed since Obama ran for office. There’s great hunger among Democrats, from New Hampshire to Arizona, for bold policies designed to empower the middle class and fix a grossly distorted economy in which the richest 1 percent of American families own 40 times the average family’s wealth. Once-forbidden ideas like Medicare-for-All and a wealth tax sound both audacious and common sense. Democrats of vastly different cultural backgrounds, whether they shop at Whole Foods or Piggly Wiggly, seem united in their contempt for unaccountable billionaires and corporations. Even hedge-fund honcho Ray Dalio tweeted a video of himself this week calling the country’s wealth gap “a national emergency.” These are arguments Democrats can win, especially with President Trump proposing almost a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare over the next decade. Conversations like these are why Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are at the forefront of the Democratic conversation.

But this Democratic primary is about to test something else: whether burgeoning public support for daring economic policies coincides with support for more hot-burning cultural issues that seem to dominate Twitter in the Trump era. In other words, Democratic voters are very down with Medicare-for-All. But do they want to be talking about reparations or socialism in a head-to-head against Trump next year? Already, at least one prominent Democrat, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, is sounding an alarm, however gently, about a presidential primary in which the current rule of the game appears to be chasing the latest shiny metal object on Twitter to win over the most plugged-in and fashionable online."

Photo by Massimo Percossi/EPA

March 12 (UPI) -- Australian Cardinal George Pell was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison for sexually abusing two choirboys in the 1990s, becoming the most senior Catholic official to be jailed for committing sex crimes against children.

Pell, 77, was convicted late last year by a Melbourne court on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 years of age and four charges of committing an indecent act on children.

The ruling was only announced late last month due to a suppression order.

The former Vatican treasurer and former Papal adviser will spend three years and eight months behind bars before he is eligible for parole for the 1996 crimes, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. He will also be registered for life as a sex offender.

Chief judge Petter Kidd said during sentencing that he was aware that Pell may not outlive his sentence.

""Facing jail at your age in these circumstances must be an awful state of affairs for you,"" Kidd said, the Guardian reported.

Kidd said the sentence must demonstrate ""grave consequences"" of breaking the law and that since Pell maintained his innocence throughout the trial, it would not be reduced as he showed no evidence of ""remorse or contrition."" His crimes, Kidd said, displayed ""staggering arrogance.""

In 1996, Pell, then the Archbishop of Melbourne, had discovered the two choirboys drinking sacramental wine, one of the abused children, now a 35-year-old man, told the jury during the trial last year.

Pell had told the boys that they were in trouble. Then he revealed himself to them and forced one of the boys to perform oral sex on him and then fondled the other, the complainant said. Some time later, the complainant said he was again attacked by Pell who pushed him against a wall, fondled his genitals and then walked away.

The other boy, who never filed a complaint against Pell, died in 2014 from a heroin overdose.

""I think you did give thought or reflection to this offending and only reasonable inference from the brazenness of your reoffending is that you had a degree of confidence that the victims would not complain either immediately,"" Kidd said during sentencing, which was broadcast throughout Australia live from a Melbourne country court.

Pell did not seek to silence the children, Kidd said, because he did not feel it was necessary, and his second transgression carried the mark of ""physical aggression and venom.""

Kidd made clear that Pell was not being made a ""scapegoat"" for the Catholic Church's failings and he was being sentenced only for crimes the jury found him guilty of.

Though he didn't shorten the sentence, Kidd said he did impose a shorter non-parole period ""in recognition in particular of your age, so as to increase the prospect of your living out the last part of your life in the community.""

Pell has filed an appeal to be heard June 5."

There is nothing remarkable about this compilation of Marxist economics and climate alarmism; what’s remarkable is the unrestrained stupidity of Democrat candidates adopting such nonsense as national policy before even reading it. This same herd mentality is behind the Democrat Party’s army of social justice mobsters and bandwagon jumpers defending Christine Blasey-Ford and Jussie Smollett.

It seems Democrats have an affinity for groupthink, which has evolved into a belief system completely divorced from reality. And for the nitwits caught up in this web of pseudo-science and phony virtue, they’ve become driven by the moral certainty of their cause, with an evangelical zeal for converting non-believers to the consensus of the groupthink.

But science and justice has never been about consensus. The missionaries of doom and hate are in no mood for dissent, and are fully prepared to demonize and destroy anyone resisting the party’s groupthink. There is some truth to Democrats’ claim that we are facing a global disaster. But that disaster isn’t from the effects of heating our homes, driving our cars, or deadly cow farts; it's from the destructive effects of their own policies.

This cult that has become the Democrat Party is entirely dependent on the herd mentality of a gullible, indoctrinated public for their political power, aided by an unquestioning and compliant media. If this cult is successful, America’s future will be firmly in the hands of the climate charlatans, Marxists, and the party’s growing cadre of old-fashioned race hustlers.

Actor and singer Jussie Smollett appeared in court Tuesday afternoon for a brief hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago.

This is coming after he was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct after police alleged he staged a hate crime.

The court appearance was to determine if cameras would be allowed for his next appearance when trial will begin.

Judge Leroy Martin Jr. approved cameras for the court appearance on Tuesday, but noted that “all bets are off” once a new judge – who has final say on the issue of cameras – is assigned permanently to the case, according to Vulture.

On Nov. 28, 2018, when the Miami Herald revealed that, in 2008, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyers, a group that included Dershowitz, had pressured then-U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta—now serving as Donald Trump's labor secretary—into negotiating a sweetheart plea deal for the billionaire financier, who was accused of molesting more than 100 underage girls.

Since that news broke, Dershowitz has appeared on Fox News a total of 27 times. Not once has anyone on the network asked him about his client or his connection to the secret plea deal a judge has since declared illegal.

Over the past year, Dershowitz has emerged as a go-to legal analyst for Fox News. His long, highly public legal career, combined with him being a lifelong Democrat who is often critical of Robert Mueller, has made him an attractive guest for Fox shows that incessantly rail against the special counsel’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

As such, the Harvard professor only ever seems to discuss one thing with Fox News—and it’s not his high-profile client.

On the evening of Nov. 28, hours after the Herald bombshell, Dershowitz appeared on Tucker Carlson’s primetime talk show. The subject of their chat? The Mueller probe.

The next night, Dershowitz appeared on Sean Hannity’s show. The topic there? The Mueller “witch hunt.” Same thing the night after that, when Dershowitz appeared on Laura Ingraham’s primetime show; and the following Monday when he once again joined Carlson.

Not a single question about Epstein, even as Dershowitz admitted to Axios that he still advises the billionaire pedophile.

On Dec. 4, Epstein settled a civil dispute and apologized to his victims’ lawyer for attempting to “defame” him. Two days later, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had opened an investigation into the 2008 plea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid facing his victims.

Over the next few months, Dershowitz appeared on Fox News another 16 times, including three chats with Tucker Carlson about the Mueller probe (including one hit in which Dershowitz defended the host against advertiser boycotts over his anti-immigrant rhetoric), and six with Hannity to discuss—get ready for this—the Mueller probe. No one asked about the Epstein case.

And then on Feb. 21, a federal judge ruled that Florida prosecutors, including Trump’s labor secretary, had broken the law by signing the plea deal brokered by Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz, without talking to the victims.

That evening, Dershowitz appeared on Laura Ingraham’s show. She didn’t ask a single question about the Epstein news. Instead, they discussed Empire star Jussie Smollett being charged with filing a false police report.

And then on March 11, a federal court took the first step in unsealing documents related to the case—a move Dershowitz has said he supports. But when the famed attorney appeared on Fox News on March 11 and March 12, hosts Ingraham and Melissa Francis respectively asked him about “Democratic anti-Semitism” and the college-admissions cheating scandal.

It’s not as though Fox News is completely disinterested in the Epstein case.

Since the Miami Herald story was published, Fox has reported on the case at least 12 times, including dispatching on-air correspondents to cover its developments. Midday news anchor Martha MacCallum once even mentioned Dershowitz’s connection to the case—albeit briefly and not with the lawyer present.

In an email to The Daily Beast, Dershowitz said he never requested that Fox News keep him out of their Epstein coverage. In fact, the lawyer said, he has brought up on Fox the allegations that he participated in the billionaire pedophile’s sex-trafficking ring.

“I actually raised it in discussing the case of the actor who falsely accused people of attacking him,” Dershowitz said, referring to Smollett. (According to transcripts, however, the lawyer only vaguely alluded to having himself been the victim of a “false report.”)

“I’m happy to discuss it on any media because I have nothing to hide and have overwhelming evidence that the story was entirely made up.”

Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

UPDATE, 7/8/19: Epstein was arrested on Saturday, July 6 and charged two days later with sex trafficking. Federal prosecutors accused him of using his wealth to “create a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit.” Since this story original published, Dershowitz has appeared on Fox News at least 44 separate times. Not once has the network asked him about Epstein.

We reported earlier how Pete's friends wouldn't be surprised if he popped the question to Kate soon. ""Pete falls hard for girls he dates and that is something that is happening with Kate. So much so that Pete's friends are first very happy for him that he has found someone that makes him feel really great and happy,"" a source close to the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.""But [friends] are also concerned he might be diving into something too fast and too soon. But that is something that is in his nature to do in the first place, so they aren't exactly surprised.

Meanwhile, on the February 28 episode, both Jussie Smollett and Robert Kraft's scandals were made fun of by the variety show. In a legal edition of ""Shark Tank,"" with sharks that included Michael Avenatti, Jeanine Pirro, Alan Dershowitz, Rudy Giuliani and jingle-based attorneys Cellino and Barnes, Jussie (played by Chris Redd) and Kraft (portrayed by Beck Bennett) pleaded for help with limited success.

Previously on the February 10 episode, ""SNL"" tackled the blackface scandal that rocked Virginia after the state's Governor and Attorney General admitting to using blackface as part of costumes. In the sketch, every Virginia state official copped up to using blackface at one point in their lives. As a frustrated Kenan Thompson attempted to run an ethics meeting, he was asked, ""Does it count if you did it all the way back in the '80s?"" At one point, Halsey asked if Thompson if it was acceptable to wear blackface ""if you're half-black,"" she then qualified her remarks by saying that by ""half-black,"" she meant dressing up as ""both Michael Jacksons"" for Halloween.

""SNL"" returns on Mar. 30 with host Sandra Oh and musical guest Tame Impala."
