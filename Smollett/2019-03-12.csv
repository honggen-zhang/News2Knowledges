CHICAGO — A lawyer for Jussie Smollett said Tuesday that she would welcome cameras in the courtroom during the ""Empire"" actor's trial on charges accusing him of lying to the police, saying there has been a lot of leaked misinformation and cameras would allow the public to ""see the evidence and the lack thereof.""

TMZ reports that the cast of the hit FOX show is anxious about the show’s chances, as there has been a delay from when they expected to hear about the show’s fate after Smollett was charged with a felony.

According to the site, the cast and crew are upset because they expected to find out about the show’s fate a couple of weeks ago, but that hasn’t happened. FOX has not yet indicated whether they will renew the music drama for a sixth season. If it is renewed, there are some several people involved with the show who have reservations about Smollett returning (assuming he even could considering he now faces sixteen felony counts).

It is important to note a couple of things for context here. One, Empire is one of Fox’s biggest hits. While the numbers are not at the height they hit in the second and third seasons, it is still the fourteenth best-rated show among all broadcast networks for the season. Being an ensemble cast that relies on much bigger-name stars than Smollett (Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson), it seems like a series that could whether the Smollett storm. It’s hard to know whether the scandal has hurt the series, as it’s been off for a scheduled break since mid-December and doesn’t return since tomorrow night.

Furthermore, while Fox renewed the show early in its first four seasons, last season it did the more traditional thing and renewed it toward the end of the season in May. So things are not looking too grim yet. However, the site reports that people involved with the show believe that Smollett’s case will factor significantly into the renewal decisions."

Smollett has kept a low profile since he was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report last month. On Tuesday, his attorney Mark Geragos was needed in a Cook County Courthouse to file paperwork allowing him to represent Smollett in the state of Illinois. While Smollett did not need to be with Geragos, he walked straight-backed past the TMZ cameras on the scene.

Insiders told the outlet that Smollett wanted to be in court to show that he is taking an active part in his own criminal defense. He also wanted to let the world know that he is not backing down or hiding in the face of these allegations.

The actor still kept a pair of big reflective sunglasses on, however. He also wore a knee-length coat buttoned up to the collar, and a pair of black gloves. Underneath, he appeared to be wearing a suit and tie.

Geragos and Smollett will return to court in earnest on Thursday. Based on the papers filed on Tuesday, Geragos will be allowed to represent his client. He also reportedly asked that the judge allow cameras in the courtroom, and the judge complied, meaning the public will continue to see updates on Smollett's case.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts last week — one for each allegedly false statement he gave police in interviews. At the time, Geragos was horrified, telling reporters that this overkill represented everything wrong with the accusations against Smollett.

""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected,"" he said. ""We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records,"" he went on.

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" Geragos finished.

While the accusation against Smollett for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself shocked the world, ongoing reports show that it could be more complicated than it seemed. The Chicago Police Department is under fire for going after Smollett, especially as the Osundairo brothers' lawyer claims that they have been misrepresented in the case.

Smollett is due back in court on Thurday to begin his proceedings."

Jussie Smollett is READY for his trial — and all the cameras it will bring!

The actor was photographed striding into a Cook County Courthouse on Tuesday for a hearing he wasn’t even required to attend.

According to reports, the hearing was really for Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos, so he could file the paperwork that allows him to rep the actor in Illinois and decide if cameras will be allowed in court for the case.

As it turns out, they will be… at least for the 36-year-old’s next court appearance.

The judge made the ruling after Tina Glandian, another lawyer for Smollett, told the court she would welcome cameras in the courtroom because there had been a lot of leaked misinformation. Cameras, she argued, would allow the public to “see the evidence and the lack thereof.”

No one was happier about the ruling than Smollett, who was camera ready when he rolled up to court rocking shades, gloves, and a sleek grey trench coat — his first time being spotted since a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts last week.

TMZ sources say the actor chose to attend the hearing because he plans on being an active participant in his defense, as opposed to just observing. So, it’s safe to assume some dramatic monologues are in store for this court showdown, which, as we’ve been reporting, is becoming more scandalous than any storyline on Empire.

On February 20, the openly gay actor was charged with one count of lying to the authorities after claiming that he had been attacked on the streets of Chicago in a brutal “hate crime.” The two men who were initially suspects later claimed the actor had paid them to stage the attack.

Weeks later, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of lying to authorities; eight counts from what he told the responding officer, and eight for what he later told a detective about being the victim of a brutal racist and homophobic beating by two masked Trump supporters in downtown Chicago.

Geragos called the charges “prosecutorial overkill” after the indictment, telling press:

“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.”

Smollett has maintained his innocence. In his GMA interview last month, the actor told Robin Roberts that there had been misinformation reported about the attack, such as him telling police that his attackers wore MAGA hats — which, according to Smollett, never happened.

Is the whole truth on Smollett’s side? The fact that his team wants cameras in the courtroom makes it seem like he has nothing to hide. Chicago police, however, apparently have lots of evidence proving otherwise.

Either way, Smollett won’t be leaving our TV screens anytime soon!"

Smollett was in court for a brief hearing, where attorney Tina Glandian said she wants cameras in the courtroom “so (the public) can see evidence and lack thereof” in the disorderly conduct case against the actor.

Illinois courts typically do not allow cameras in the courts, but state judges have discretion to allow proceedings to be filmed if they feel it is in the public interest.

“There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact,” Glandian told reporters following Tuesday’s hearing. “The evidence against Mr. Smollett is demonstrably false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so the public and media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is going to be, actually, a lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett.”

Prosecutors said they have no objections to allowing cameras in the courtroom.

Judge LeRoy Martin Jr., Cook County Circuit Court's criminal division presiding judge, said that he will allow a videographer for Smollett’s Thursday court appearance, when he is expected to be arraigned. Martin is also expected to assign the case to a trial judge at the next hearing.

Martin said that the trial judge will determine whether cameras should be allowed in the courtroom for proceedings in Smollet’s case beyond Thursday.

Smollett did not comment following the hearing. He was accompanied to court Tuesday by two of his brothers, a sister-in-law and his assistant.

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts, accusing him of staging a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men near his Chicago apartment.

Police allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to bolster his profile.

He told police that two assailants beat him and threw a rope around his neck, while hurling racial and anti-gay slurs at him. Smollett also told police that one of the attackers also yelled, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

Police arrested two men, brothers who knew Smollett and had worked with him on “Empire,” weeks after the incident and identified them as suspects. They later released the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, without charge.

The brothers told police that Smollett plotted the assault, gave them money to purchase supplies for the ruse and paid them $3,500 for taking part in the alleged plot.

Smollett is free on $100,000 bond."

Smollett -- who was not required to attend Tuesday's hearing -- wore sunglasses and a gray coat as he arrived at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse, and remained silent when asked by reporters for comment. ET has learned cameras will be allowed in the courtroom on Thursday for Smollett's upcoming hearing. The actor's legal team welcomes cameras as a counter to what they call misinformation leaked to the media.

A source tells ET that Smollett chose to come to court on Tuesday because he wants to be as transparent as possible, and that he looks forward to the evidence being presented in court.

Meanwhile, ET has learned that attorney Mark Geragos filed paperwork on Monday to officially represent Smollett in Illinois. The high profile attorney will be representing Smollett in court on Thursday.

Earlier this month, the 36-year-old Empire actor was indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury in Chicago. The counts focus on allegedly false statements made to two different Chicago Police officers.

""Jussie Smollett knew that at the time of this transmission there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,"" the indictment states.

In a statement to ET, Geragos said: ""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.

Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.""

Meanwhile, following the news of his indictment, Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: "" ... Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors.""

Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime. When reporting the January attack, Smollett claimed that he was assaulted by two masked men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured what he believed was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck.

But in a press conference following Smollett's arrest, Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department Eddie T. Johnson claimed that the actor staged his alleged attack to promote his career, and because he was ""dissatisfied"" with his Empire salary.

""As far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on his face were most likely self-inflicted,"" Johnson alleged. "" ... Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

Smollett has maintained that he is a victim and has denied all the allegations that he staged the incident.

Smollett appeared at a court hearing on whether cameras should be allowed in court to document his case. Neither prosecutors nor Smollett's team objected to the cameras.

Cook County Judge LeRoy Martin said cameras would be allowed at the case's next hearing, which will determine which judge will preside over Smollett's case. That judge will decide whether cameras will be permitted during future proceedings.

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts by a grand jury Thursday.

He originally told police that two men attacked him, tied a rope around his neck, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs as well as pro-Trump language.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage an attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

A judge on Tuesday agreed to allow cameras in the courtroom for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s next hearing on charges that he lied to police about what was portrayed as a racist and homophobic attack Jan. 29 in Chicago.

Smollett faces 16 felony counts in the case, as we reported previously. Mark Geragos, one of Smollett’s attorneys, has characterized the indictment as “prosecutorial overkill.”

In court today, Tina Glandian, another attorney for Smollett, argued for cameras in the courtroom, saying they would allow the public to “see the evidence and the lack thereof.” The AP reports that both sides agreed on the issue of cameras for the next hearing, scheduled for Thursday.

“During that hearing, the case will be assigned to a trial judge who will then likely ask Smollett to enter a plea,” the AP reports. “Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. said Tuesday that the new judge will decide whether or not to allow cameras in the courtroom during subsequent hearings and the trial.”

Glandian was quoted telling reporters after today’s hearing that the evidence presented against Smollett is “demonstrably false.”

The AP report quotes Glandian saying: “We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.”"

Smollett was not required to be present at the hearing, but a representative for Smollett told NBC News that appeared to “show confidence in his innocence.”

“He will do everything he needs to do,” crisis management expert Anne Kavanaugh said. “He will go the extra mile to cooperate with the process.”

Smollett’s team did not object to cameras being allowed in court. On Thursday, a judge will be assigned to the case. That judge will then decide whether media will be allowed to participate in the trail during the case.

According to NBC News, Smollett chose not to answer any questions that reporters shouted at him as he entered the courtroom. Last week, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts for allegations of filing a false police report about the alleged homophobic, racist attack that occurred in the early hours of January 29. Smollett received an indictment on 16 separate allegations made in the police report.

Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill” and “vindictive” on Friday. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”

Smollett originally told police that his attackers yelled that this was “MAGA country” during the attack. He claimed they poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. Police later arrested brother Abel and Ola Osundairo for the crime. After interrogating them, Smollett became a suspect and police alleged that he paid the brothers $3,500 to carry out the attack.

OTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Mark Geragos: Jussie Smollett’s Lawyer Reacts to Actor’s 16 Felony Charges: ‘I Expected it’

*Meanwhile, embattled actor Jussie Smollett appeared with his attorney at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago on Tuesday. The hearing was to determine whether cameras will be allowed into court during his proceedings on Thursday.

As reported by TMZ, Smollett, 36, was accompanied his siblings and his legal team, including famed attorney Mark Geragos. His attendance wasn’t required as CBS Chicago tweeted: “He is choosing to be here. Not required.”

The “Empire” star was arrested last month for allegedly conspiring with two Nigerian-American brothers to orchestrate the Jan, 29 attack. He was charged with one felony count of lying to police when investigators determined he paid the brothers to help him fake a hate crime.

Smollett now faces 16 felony charges and a maximum of 64 years in prison for filing a false police report. He was hit with one felony for every lie he allegedly told. According to the report, offers for acting and club gigs have dried up since the indictments.

“We’re told Smollett’s getting zero calls for new work, and is being treated like a pariah.”

Jussie maintains his innocence and he did not make a statement to reporters in court this afternoon."

Elizabeth Warren and her presidential campaign have found that out the hard way.

According to Politico, the tech giant took down an ad from the Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential contender that called for the breakup of social media conglomerates.

“The ads, which had identical images and text, touted Warren’s recently announced plan to unwind ‘anti-competitive’ tech mergers, including Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram,” Politico reported.

“’Three companies have vast power over our economy and our democracy. Facebook, Amazon, and Google,’ read the ads, which Warren’s campaign had placed Friday. ‘We all use them. But in their rise to power, they’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field in their favor.’”

And apparently, Warren’s campaign got this message in response:

TRENDING: Chicago Mayor Calls 'Scooby-Doo' Parody Criticizing Her 'Racist,' Then the Artist Fires Back

“This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook’s advertising policies.”

Of course, Facebook said the whole thing was a mistake, honest!

“We removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo,” a Facebook spokesperson said, according to Politico.

“In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.”

Warren was decidedly unconvinced by this explanation.

Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let’s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn’t dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTech https://t.co/UPS6dozOxn — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 11, 2019

“Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let’s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power,” she tweeted on Monday.

“Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn’t dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTech”

That Facebook doesn’t love “robust debate” isn’t a terrible surprise to conservatives, who have long been the target of the social media giant’s ire.

Take, for instance, a story by Rod Dreher at The American Conservative called “Jussie Smollet’s Hate Hoax.” When one Facebook user tried to share it, the user was told the story didn’t meet community standards and had the post taken down.

“Facebook will apparently not allow its users to say that police believe Smollett, a black gay actor, may have paid his two ‘assailants’ to attack him last month, and blamed it on white Trump supporters — this, even though that is being reported by multiple national media outlets,” Dreher wrote.

Smollett, in case you’ve been living under a rock, was later charged with exactly what Dreher was writing about.

And then there was Franklin Graham; the nationally known evangelist was banned for 24 hours back in December over a two-year-old post on North Carolina’s transgender bathroom bill.

“They’re making & changing the rules,” Graham said at the time. “Truth is truth. God made the rules & His Word is truth. The free exchange of ideas is part of our country’s DNA.”

Facebook has been all about censoring conservative organizations and removing their content, affecting everyone from pro-life groups to Dennis Prager’s Prager University video series.

And, as The Western Journal has demonstrated, Facebook’s 2018 algorithm changes have hit conservative publishers considerably harder than liberal publishers.

So, welcome to the club, Sen. Warren. The fact that Facebook is willing to pursue its self-interests in the most obvious of ways is nothing new, although usually liberals are exempt. After all, most of the time Facebook’s self-interest is decidedly in the liberal camp.

But when it requires throwing a liberal under the bus, well, so be it.

Warren’s usually wrong on most things, but the blind squirrel finds an acorn every now and then. The fact is that Facebook is way too powerful in the political arena, something that Warren’s supporters are just finding out.

Even if Facebook’s original reasoning behind banning the ads is accurate, that still doesn’t make it OK. It just means that Facebook’s algorithms pull totally innocuous advertisements for capricious reasons.

If this weren’t Elizabeth Warren, one of the top contenders for the Democrat nomination in 2020, how quickly do you think this would have been restored? How much of a fuss would have been made?

Like it or not, Warren is one of the most powerful people in America and she still had to fight for free speech on Facebook.

That should tell you a great deal about how powerful the social media giant is — as well as how responsible it is in using that power.

This court hearing comes a few days ahead of the Empire actor’s Thursday court date, when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Smollett had claimed he was the victim of a brutal hate crime at the hands of supporters of President Trump in Chicago early in the morning of January 29. But after a thorough investigation, police declared it a hoax, and that Smollett hired two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, to carry out the fake attack.

On Monday’s Good Morning America, Osundairo brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said the brothers felt betrayed by Smollett.



“They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,” Schmidt said. “This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career.”

Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims. “That’s why when they went from ‘persons of interest’ to suspects. They are free men and they are at home,” she said.



As previously reported, after Smollett reported the alleged attack, police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the incident. The brothers were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

After Smollett’s arraignment, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told reporters that the “phony attack” was “orchestrated” by the actor “to boost his profile” amid “a salary dispute.”

Smollett, who still maintains his innocence, is due back in court this Thursday, March 14th at 9am.

Jussie Smollett briefly appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether or not cameras would be allowed in the courtroom for his upcoming disorderly conduct trial in which he’s accused of staging a racist, homophobic attack on himself and reporting it to police as true.

Judge Leroy Martin Jr. approved cameras for Smollett’s next court appearance on Tuesday, but noted that “all bets are off” once a new judge — who has final say on the issue of cameras — is assigned permanently to the case.

Neither side objected to cameras in the courtroom (an issue parties sometimes raise due to privacy concerns), but Smollett’s legal team was particularly warm to the idea on account of what Smollett attorney Tina Glandian called “substantial misinformation” that had been leaked throughout the investigation. Glandian said the defense welcomed cameras for the trial so that the public could “see the evidence, [or] the lack thereof.”

Smollett, 36, who appeared in a suit and dress coat, was accompanied by his two brothers, his sister-in-law, and an assistant; he did not make any remarks during the brief hearing. Though he wasn’t required to appear in court Tuesday, his defense team’s spokesperson Anne Kavanagh told NBC News that Smollett did it “to show confidence in his innocence.”

Smollett last week was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being victimized in a hate-fueled attack in late January. Smollett initially reported that he was beaten in a late-night attack in downtown Chicago by two white men in ski masks who told him “this is MAGA country” then tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

The attack was an apparent escalation after the actor reported receiving a threatening letter that contained white powder sent to the set of Empire in Chicago.

Though Chicago police initially treated the attack as a hate crime against the actor, who is black and gay, the investigation turned to Smollett once police interviewed two brothers who said Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

The alleged hoax attack angered Chicago officials, including Superintendent Eddie Johnson who slammed Smollett for dragging the city’s “reputation through the mud.”

Smollett’s attorneys have called the 16-count indictment “redundant” and “vindictive.” Smollett has maintained that he’s innocent of the charges."

""Anderson Cooper is a mix of news and opinion, but Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo are obviously heavy on opinion and use the news as a launching pad for those opinions,"" Cornell University Law Professor William Jacobson told Fox News. ""There's nothing inherently wrong with that, so long as they are not mischaracterized as part of the news operation.""

PRESSURE BUILDS ON CNN AS NAACP QUESTIONS NETWORK'S 'TROUBLING' LACK OF DIVERSITY

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News that CNN’s primetime shows “are not straightforward news shows in the traditional sense of objective journalism,” pointing out that the opinions of the hosts are often very bluntly presented.

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO ACCUSED OF POLITICIZING ALEX TREBEK’S CANCER DIAGNOSIS

“News consumers are increasingly suspicious of programs that blend news and opinion, and a news organization's failure to properly label contributes to the national decline in credibility from the public."" — Jeffrey McCall

“News consumers are increasingly suspicious of programs that blend news and opinion, and a news organization's failure to properly label contributes to the national decline in credibility from the public,” McCall said.

While MSNBC and Fox News are transparent about specific on-air personalities hosting opinion shows, CNN claims its evening lineup is filled with straight news anchors. And while CNN personalities often conflate the opinion and news divisions of other media outlets in order to point out a perceived bias, CNN characterizes all three of its primetime programs as “news” shows, according to the section of its website that labels other shows in an “interview and debate” category.

A news anchor and an opinion host might not seem very different to the average TV watcher, but the media industry considers the titles distinct. News anchors are expected to report the news and leave the punditry up to the opinion hosts. Back in 2010, Lemon famously proclaimed CNN doesn’t “do opinion,” creating a quote that is often revisited by the network’s critics.

“We put the story out there and we try to stay in the middle of the road,” Lemon said at the time.

But much has changed since Lemon’s claim, and President Trump’s shock victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 has dramatically altered the way CNN covers the news. The network which has long tried to posture as the down-the-middle cable channel that focuses on journalism, and is above the partisanship, now allows its talent to offer their personal thoughts on various subjects.

CNN ACCUSED BY NABJ OF LACKING DIVERSITY; ZUCKER REFUSES TO MEET WITH GROUP

Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock feels that Cooper, Lemon and Cuomo spend “three hours each night spewing anti-Trump rage” and the network should change their titles.

“They should be honest and simply admit what the whole country already knows: They are liberal commenters, not objective reporters,” Murdock said. “That's perfectly fine, so long as their audience, such as it is, enjoys some truth in advertising.""

“They should be honest and simply admit what the whole country already knows: They are liberal commenters, not objective reporters."" — Deroy Murdock

A glance at Twitter reveals that Cooper, Lemon and Cuomo are quick to offer their view on the topic of the day.

Over the past few days alone, Cooper mocked Trump’s actions as “not normal,” Lemon got emotional that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has lost in the “court of public opinion” and Cuomo -- the younger brother of New York’s Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo -- offers a nightly segment called “closing argument,” which is clearly and firmly rooted in his own opinions.

Prior to midterm elections, CNN attracted more Democratic viewers than MSNBC, which is openly left-wing,” Daily Caller media editor Amber Athey told Fox News.

As for Cooper, on Monday he blasted President Trump for his recent attacks on Democrats after Congress failed to condemn Rep. Ilhan Omar for her anti-Semitic remarks. The “AC360” host began by ripping the president as “remarkably selective” and didn’t stop there, as he was clearly fired up that Trump told reporters last week that Democrats were the “anti-Israel” and “anti-Jewish” party.

FOX NEWS DOMINATES MSNBC, CNN ACROSS THE BOARD DURING FEBRUARY

“It’s so outrageous that one has to address it, but by addressing it as we are tonight and we have on Friday, by addressing it, one is exactly playing into the president’s hands in terms of saying something so incendiary that it has to be challenged on a factual basis at the very least if not a moral one,” Cooper said. “The problem is the president- you’re dealing with somebody who has absolutely no shame and is willing to say anything and that’s a real problem for Democrats and for anybody.”

McCall said that “nobody will confuse these commentary shows with the more traditional television news shows delivered by Walter Cronkite or Frank Reynolds or Chet Huntley” in the earlier days of television news.

The opinionated rhetoric is in addition to on-screen primetime graphics that mock and question the president’s every step and regular panel discussions that typically feature several anti-Trump commentators with either a symbolic, lone quasi-conservative or none at all. As a result, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told Fox News last year that it’s time for CNN to come clean regarding where the network stands politically.

“It is not the place to go to for hard news or for neutral news. It’s a mini MSNBC and they ought to admit it,” Fleischer said.

This court hearing comes a few days ahead of the Empire actor’s Thursday court date, when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Smollett had claimed he was the victim of a brutal hate crime at the hands of supporters of President Trump in Chicago early in the morning of January 29. But after a thorough investigation, police declared it a hoax, and that Smollett hired two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, to carry out the fake attack.

On Monday’s Good Morning America, Osundairo brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said the brothers felt betrayed by Smollett.

“They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,” Schmidt said. “This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career.”

Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims. “That’s why when they went from ‘persons of interest’ to suspects. They are free men and they are at home,” she said.



As previously reported, after Smollett reported the alleged attack, police identified and questioned two “persons of interest” captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the incident. The brothers were arrested on Feb. 13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects.

After Smollett’s arraignment, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told reporters that the “phony attack” was “orchestrated” by the actor “to boost his profile” amid “a salary dispute.”

Smollett, who still maintains his innocence, is due back in court this Thursday, March 14th at 9am.

At this point, no one knows who is telling the truth: the Chicago Police Department or the “Empire” actor. Now, the lawyer for Smollett’s alleged accomplices, Nigerian-American brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, appeared to only make things worse in an awkward interview on “Good Morning America” on Monday.

Gloria Schmidt told George Stephanopoulos that the $3,500 the Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers were paid for staging the attack was actually for fitness training.

“They were paid for the training … but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” she said.

When pressed about whether there was any evidence to back up their claims, she said they were asked to “do this favor.”

When pushed on what incentive brothers had to stage the attacked, Schmidt said, “If you’re friends, and I’m saying ‘Hey, I’m going to pay you for training, I’m also asking you to do me a favor’ … and the favor was to stage the attack.”

Schmidt claimed the brothers also feel “taken advantage of,” but she wouldn’t directly answer if she thought the attack was a hoax.

“I’m confident that they did not do a hate crime,” Schmidt said.

Attorney for brothers in Smollett case speaks out https://t.co/H1qDtJOQJ8 — Gloria V. Schmidt, Esq (@GloriaSchmidtR1) March 11, 2019

Smollett on Friday was indicted by a grand jury on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

“What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,” the actor’s lawyer, Mark Geragos told CNN on Friday. “And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty.”

He continued, calling out the Chicago Police Department.

“He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report,” Geragos said. “Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything. So I don’t understand how it comes from.”

Geragos also challenged the idea that Smollett staged an attack because he wanted a higher salary on the prime time soap opera.

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” he said. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show ‘Empire; who says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones that started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

He also accused Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson of tainting the jury pool.

Watch Geragos below:

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The Chicago Police Department claimed the Osundairo brothers told them the attack was orchestrated by Smollett and that they were paid $3,500. However, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” and “went too far” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself.

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

Smollett appeared at a hearing on Tuesday at Leighton Criminal Courts Building in Chicago, E! News reports. The Empire star donned a gray coat over gray pants paired with a white button-down shirt and tie. He reportedly showed that he was confident in his defense.

The hearing was regarding if his case will have cameras or if it will be a more private affair. Charlie De Mar of CBS Chicago confirmed via Twitter shortly after the hearing that cameras will be permitted during the case on Thursday. De Mar reports that this is something the Smollett team encourages, though it was reported that they were previously against it.

The 35-year-old actor and musician was indicted on 16 felony counts on Thursday. Smollett allegedly lied to police in February about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack on January 29. Smollett reportedly accused two men of attacking and pouring bleach on him while he walked to a Subway in Chicago. Smollett was arrested and charged with one count of disorderly conduct after filing a false police report in late February. The actor was soon released on a $100,000 bond.

Judge in #JussieSmollett to allow cameras in court for upcoming hearing https://t.co/4x6dngTScr — ET Canada (@ETCanada) March 12, 2019

According to TMZ, Smollett’s appearance at Tuesday’s hearing was unwarranted. While he didn’t have to be there, he reportedly chose to attend because he wants to be an “active participant” in his defense case and is also tired of hiding from the public. Smollett has been laying low and avoiding the public as much as possible since the recent charges brought against him. His lawyer, Mark Geragos, released a statement shortly after his client was indicted. Geragos maintains his client’s innocence and is confident a jury will see the same.

“The fact of an indictment is not unexpected,” he said. “We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”"

But you might not know that if you were to look at the promo photos from the midseason premiere episode, which Fox recently posted to its press site, ’cause Jamal (Smollett) isn’t in a single one of them. And the hip-hop soap opera’s third lead is not in the shots for the following two episodes either.

Smollett — who plays the openly gay middle son of Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) and Lucious (Terrence Howard) — is absent from all 38 production stills that are currently available to media from Episode 510, 511, and 512.

However, the other regular cast members, including Howard, Henson, Bryshere Y. Gray, Trai Byers, Nicole Ari Parker, Gabourey Sidibe and even Season 5 newcomer A.Z. Kelsey, are all present and accounted for to some degree in the photos.

For the sake of comparison, Lucious/Howard is in 11 of the 38 promotional pics, Cookie/Henson is in 10, Hakeem/Gray is in four and Andre/Byers is in six. Hell, Andre Royo’s character Thirsty Rawlings is in five of them.

“Empire” executive producers announced last month that they had decided to cut Smollett from the final two episodes of the Fox hip hop drama’s current season, following his arrest on the charge of filing a false police report.

But since he hasn’t been cut from the ones that were already in the can prior to that decision, his absence from the promo photos for the first three episodes of “Empire’s” midseason return is quite noticeable.

TheWrap has already seen an advanced press screener of the premiere and can say — without giving away any spoilers — that Jamal is featured prominently in the episode.

Fox declined TheWrap’s request for comment for this story.

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for making a false report by a Chicago grand jury last Friday.

The actor was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month, in connection to an incident he reported on Jan. 29, in which he said he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

He is set to appear in court this Thursday.

According to TMZ, the series has not yet been renewed by Fox and “anxiety is high” among the cast and crew of the series that the show could end up canceled. Beyond the question of whether Smollett will be fired from the show, and what might happen to his character in the event of such a firing, there’s a chance the series might not return at all.

Empire, most years, has been renewed for the following season in January, although last year’s renewal by Fox came later. Some on the Empire set “feel like Jussie and his case will be a big factor in how things shake out,” TMZ said.

A Page Six report earlier this week said that the Empire team is “divided” on Smollett. While most of the cast continues to back the actor, the crew remains much less supportive. This came to a head, according to that report, when a well-wishes card for Smollett was circulated, and some crew members, including the hair and makeup department, neglected to sign it.

Smollett, as was announced last month, will not appear on the last two episodes of this season of Empire, with the explanation that his character is traveling out of the country.

Reports surfaced at the end of January that Smollett had been attacked in a racist and homophobic hate crime near his apartment in Chicago, where the series films. The attack made national news, but near-immediate doubts were raised in some quarters as to whether the attack had really happened the way Smollett said it had.

As media outlets, including several Chicago TV stations, began receiving leaks from the Chicago Police Department that undermined Smollett’s narrative, the actor continued to insist that he really had been attacked when he appeared in a pair of national television interviews, including one with Robin Roberts. Later, two men who had been declared persons of interest told police that they had helped Smollett to stage the attack, and Smollett was arrested on February 20.

Smollett was originally charged with a single count of filing a false police report, but was later charged with 16 more felony counts of “false report of offense.” He may face further charges down the road."

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett appeared at a hearing Tuesday in Chicago on whether cameras would be allowed in court when he stands trial on charges of staging a racist, homophobic attack on himself.

He was not required to appear, but a representative for the actor told NBC News that Smollett chose to do so “to show confidence in his innocence.”

“He will do everything he needs to do,” the representative, Anne Kavanagh, said. “He will go the extra mile to cooperate with the process.”

Neither the state nor Smollett's defense team objected to cameras being allowed in court.

Judge LeRoy Martin of the Cook County court said cameras would be allowed at a hearing Thursday morning at which time a judge will be assigned to the case. That judge will make a decision on media coverage for the duration of Smollett's case.

Smollett's attorneys, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian, filed motions Monday requesting to be allowed to represent him in the case. The judge approved Glandian's request on Tuesday.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that ""a lot of misinformation"" has been presented against Smollett that is ""demonstrably false.""

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett,"" Glandian said. ""And we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.""

Smollett, who is free on $100,000 bond, went through security at the court without answering questions reporters shouted at him.

The actor, who is black and gay, was indicted last week by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 felony counts charging that he had falsely reported to police that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him.

Smollett told police Jan. 29 that his attackers poured a chemical, possibly bleach, over him and put a noose around his neck.

Police initially treated the incident as a hate crime, but later said Smollett paid two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, $3,500 to carry out the assault.

After Smollett's arrest, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said the actor was unhappy with his salary on the Fox drama series “Empire” and had sent himself a letter containing racist language, and when that did not work, he allegedly paid the two brothers to orchestrate the attack.

Geragos said in a statement Friday that the indictment was “prosecutorial overkill” and “redundant and vindictive.”

“Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” he said."

A Fox spokesman Tuesday told TheBlaze he had ""no comment at this time"" on the matter.



Longtime ""Empire"" personnel expected to get word on the show's fate about two weeks ago, TMZ said, adding that in years past Fox renewed the program in January. However, last year — Season 4 — the renewal didn't happen until a few weeks before the last episode in May, TMZ added.

The outlet said production sources indicated Smollett's case and how it develops will play a big role in the future of ""Empire.""

""Empire"" executive producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal, will be removed from the final two episodes of the season ""to avoid further disruption on set."" The show returns to the screen Wednesday night, and TMZ sources said Jamal will be ""out of the country.""

The outlet added that its sources indicated that even if ""Empire"" is renewed for another season, studio executives have reservations about Smollett returning. A recent report said ""Empire"" crew members responded with disgust when cast members asked them to sign a card showing support for Smollett.

What else?

Smollett claimed two masked men jumped him in a Chicago street at about 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in near zero temperatures, put a noose around his neck, poured a bleach-like substance on him, and yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" No video was ever found of the alleged attack.

In his high-profile interview with ABC News' Robin Roberts last month, Smollett said he was ""pissed off"" at assertions that his claims were a hoax — but that's exactly what Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said they were the day Smollett was arrested about a week after the Roberts interview.

Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo told police Smollett paid them to stage the attack. Smollett maintained his innocence after his felony arrest. An attorney for the Osundairo brothers said Smollett betrayed their trust:

CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett walked back into court in Chicago Tuesday morning, days after he was charged with 16 felony counts related to that alleged hoax.The judge ruled to allow cameras in the courtroom during Thursday's court hearing. After the case is assigned to a judge, that judge will rule on whether cameras can be in the court for future proceedings.Smollett's attorney said he welcomes cameras.""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstratively false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we see as the actual lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" said Tina Glandian, attorney for Smollett, after the hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.The ""Empire"" actor will return to court on Thursday when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood in January, but police said it was a hoax and that Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the fake attack.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on ""Empire"" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors said Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the ""Empire"" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack.

Zoe Reardon, 18, killed Kaitlin Hunt, her 3-month-old daughter, Riley, and her family friend, Kathy Deming, 61, according to WSB.

After a plea deal, Reardon, who was 17 at the time of the crime, will only serve 36 months of probation and could regain her driver’s license in a year.

In September 2017, Hunt, Deming and the child were crossing the street in downtown Woodstock, Georgia, when Reardon reportedly hit them while driving.

Investigators determined she was not speeding and that neither drugs nor alcohol was present in her system. However, prosecutors alleged that Reardon was “engaged in an act which distracted her from the safe operation of the vehicle.” She reportedly sent a text message at 8:12 p.m. and the accident occurred at 8:15.

Reardon argued that she could not see the pedestrians while driving. Judge Alan Jordan had extreme mercy on the teen and decided against sentencing her to prison.

Reardon actually could serve less time than actor Jussie Smollett. The embattled “Empire” star faces 64 years in person after being indicted on 16 felony charges related to hate attack he allegedly planned. Smollett’s alleged crime did not lead to death, but he could spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted.

The weak sentence given to Reardon caused an uproar on social media.

Well according to those same sources, Future and Drake have already completed a sequel to 2015’s What a Time to be Alive. The effort is said to be entirely new music and is not leftovers from their recording sessions over the last few years.

The Empire actor arrived at Cook County criminal court around 11am CST wearing reflective sunglasses and offering a slight smile.

He was not required to be there, but reportedly chose to attend the hearing to prove he intends to be an active participant in his defense. He entered with Tina Glandian, a lawyer from his attorney Mark Geragos' firm.

Judge LeRoy Martin Jr allowed for one still camera and one video camera to be present at 36-year-old Smollett's next court appearance, which will be his arraignment on Thursday.

But from there an appointed judge who will preside over the case can ultimately decide over the use of cameras for all future proceedings.

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

Police allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the January 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

During Tuesday's hearing Smollett's attorney Glandian was in favor of having cameras in the courtroom saying the defense wanted the public to see what happens in court.

'In light of the substantial amount of misinformation in the case, the defense actually welcomes cameras in the courtroom,' she said as per the Chicago Tribune.

'We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence — and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence — against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,' she added.

It was the first time Smollett was in court since his arrest.

The actor requested permission to leave the state this month to visit California, where his attorney Mark Geragos is based.

Smollett is free on $100,000 bond and has another hearing scheduled for Thursday where he'll be arraigned for those 16 felony counts and where a judge will be assigned over his case.

That judge has the power to potentially reverse or modify any decision made Tuesday about cameras in the courtroom.

He is facing a maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars and fines of up to $400,000.

A grand jury indicted 36-year-old Smollett last week on 16 felony counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago

Smollett's attorneys have called the charges 'prosecutorial overkill' and the actor has vehemently maintained his innocence.

He is expected to cut a plea deal with authorities, according to experts cited by ABC.

Cops initially investigated the case as a hate crime but piecing together surveillance camera footage it led them to Nigerian bodybuilding brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, aged 25 and 27, who were extras on Empire and worked with the actor fitness coaches.

During 47 hours of questioning the pair told police Smollett planned out the fake attack himself and paid them $3,500 to carry it out.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt said they were 'taken advantage of' by the star in the hoax attack.

Their lawyer maintained that the check written out to the brothers was for training and not explicitly for the attack.

'It would be such an easy narrative to see it that way but it's a very complicated relationship... If you're friends and I'm saying, ""Hey, I'm going to pay you for training but I'm also asking you to do me a favor"" and the favor was to stage the attack,' Schmidt said on Good Morning America.

About three weeks after the brothers were arrested, prosecutors charged Smollett with making a false report.

Since then he's been written off of the final episodes of the show that skyrocketed him to fame.

The fifth season of Empire premieres on Wednesday and Smollett was notably absent from all of the show's promotional photos for the next chapter.

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Thursday.

Anderson Cooper spoke with Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos last week about the 16-count felony indictment against the Empire actor for staging a hate crime.

Said Geragos: “This is an outrage….I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime, basically.”

“They have not talked to one person at Fox who has said he was dissatisfied with his money,” Geragos continued. “They have not interviewed one person connected with the show Empirewho says he was dissatisfied with his money. They are the ones who started their internal investigation about the leaks because all of the information that was being leaked was false.”

Added Geragos: “What is happening here is frankly a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions. And that’s the reason I got into this. I’ve never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case. It’s startling the way people assume that he’s guilty. He hasn’t been given one stitch of discovery. There isn’t one police report. Your package just said he paid $3,500. I’ve got the texts. Those texts––and they conceded that the check and the texts were for training. It wasn’t to pay anything! So I don’t understand where any of this comes from.”

Anderson then asked why the brothers would do such a thing: “Doesn’t it just seem weird to you that you get allegedly attacked by two people who you know and you don’t seem to recognize them, even you claimed you fought back and they ran away, and — I believe initially Mr. Smollett said one of them was white, or they were white — Isn’t it just weird that you get allegedly attacked by two people you actually know that have been on Empire that, who you have actually worked out with, and you don’t recognize them?”

“Yes,” replied Geragos. “I don’t know whether he made that statement but what I do know is that when he was told that they had evidence against these two he refused to sign the complaint because he could not believe it.”

Added Geragos: “I haven’t seen one piece of evidence and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this. What they do have is a great case against the two brothers….What do they have besides their word that he is in on this.”"

Smollett — who plays the openly gay middle son of Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) and Lucious (Terrence Howard) — is absent from all 38 production stills that are currently available to media from Episode 510, 511, and 512.

However, the other regular cast members, including Howard, Henson, Bryshere Y. Gray, Trai Byers, Nicole Ari Parker, Gabourey Sidibe and even Season 5 newcomer A.Z. Kelsey, are all present and accounted for to some degree in the photos.

For the sake of comparison, Lucious/Howard is in 11 of the 38 promotional pics, Cookie/Henson is in 10, Hakeem/Gray is in four and Andre/Byers is in six. Hell, Andre Royo’s character Thirsty Rawlings is in five of them.

“Empire” executive producers announced last month that they had decided to cut Smollett from the final two episodes of the Fox hip hop drama’s current season, following his arrest on the charge of filing a false police report.

But since he hasn’t been cut from the ones that were already in the can prior to that decision, his absence from the promo photos for the first three episodes of “Empire’s” midseason return is quite noticeable.

TheWrap has already seen an advanced press screener of the premiere and can say — without giving away any spoilers — that Jamal is featured prominently in the episode.

Fox declined TheWrap’s request for comment for this story.

Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for making a false report by a Chicago grand jury last Friday.

The actor was originally charged with one felony count for filing a false police report by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office last month, in connection to an incident he reported on Jan. 29, in which he said he was attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

Smollett surrendered himself to Chicago police on Feb. 21, hours after he was formally charged. He was released from police custody later that afternoon, after posting bail and surrendering his passport following a bond hearing.

He is set to appear in court this Thursday.

Cameras will be allowed inside the courtroom for Jussie Smollett‘s next hearing in Chicago later this week, a judge ruled Tuesday.

One still camera and one video camera will be allowed when the “Empire” star appears in court Thursday, Chief Cook County Criminal Courts Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. decided, according to the Chicago Sun Times.

Smollett’s trial judge will decide whether cameras can be present for future hearings in the case, he added.

Smollett’s attorneys didn’t object to the presence of media in the courtroom, saying there had been a lot of “false information spread” in the case, according to NBC Chicago.

The embattled actor — who is accused of filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate crime — attended Tuesday’s hearing, even though his presence was not required in the court.

A spokeswoman for Smollett said he wanted to “show up and show respect to the court.”

“He wants to hold his head up high, show confidence in his innocence,” Anne Kavanagh told NBC.

“He’s not hiding from anything.”"

CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett walked back into court in Chicago Tuesday morning, days after he was charged with 16 felony counts related to that alleged hoax.The judge ruled to allow cameras in the courtroom during Thursday's court hearing. After the case is assigned to a judge, that judge will rule on whether cameras can be in the court for future proceedings.Smollett's attorney said he welcomes cameras.""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstratively false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we see as the actual lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" said Tina Glandian, attorney for Smollett, after the hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.The ""Empire"" actor will return to court on Thursday when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood in January, but police said it was a hoax and that Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the fake attack.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on ""Empire"" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors said Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the ""Empire"" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:"

We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we see as the actual lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" said Tina Glandian, attorney for Smollett, after the hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.The ""Empire"" actor will return to court on Thursday when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood in January, but police said it was a hoax and that Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the fake attack.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew.

The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:"

Wearing a gray coat, sunglasses and black gloves, 'Smollett appeared at the Chicago courthouse Tuesday.

Smollett was initially charged with one count of lying to the authorities on Feb. 20. Last week, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of lying to authorities — eight counts from what he told the officer who responded to the report of the attack, and eight for what he later told a detective about being the victim of a brutal racist and homophobic beating by two masked men in downtown Chicago back in January.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT INDICTED ON 16 FELONY COUNTS FOLLOWING CHICAGO ATTACK ALLEGATIONS

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the Jan. 29 incident because he was unhappy with his salary on the Fox show and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, called the charges ""prosecutorial overkill."" Smollett maintains his innocence.

Chicago police have made it clear they are upset at the man they claim thrust the Windy City back into the national spotlight over race relations.

""What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,"" Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men, said.

Even though Smollett's attorney called the 16-count indictment overkill, prominent Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, told The Associated Press that it's the way prosecutors in Chicago do business.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

""It is common practice for the Cook County state's attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,"" he said.

A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations.

""If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you're done,"" said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. ""This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.""

Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett's account into individual pieces and accusing him of one count per detail they believe he made up.

That means that one count might stem from Smollett's contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical, and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black.

""The lies add up pretty fast,"" Lopez said.

Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence.

Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won't matter whether it's on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That's because he would be sentenced for only one of them.

""If you add them all up it's still only one crime,"" Erickson said. ""That's just how it is.""

And Lopez said that if Smollett is convicted of multiple counts, prosecutors can ask that the sentences be served consecutively but it is highly unlikely a judge would do so.

Smollett's legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Days before the Jan. 29 incident, a letter threatening Smollett was sent to the studio where the television show is filmed — a letter Johnson told reporters the day Smollett appeared in court that the actor had actually sent.

The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if Smollett did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble.

""Lying to the FBI is a crime,"" said Erickson.

Libertines frontman Pete Doherty kept things pretty restrained on his 40th birthday in Margate, Kent.

A shadow of his party-loving self, the rocker was pictured walking with his two Husky dogs as he reached a big birthday milestone on Tuesday.

He was dressed in a typically-cool, oversized Parka jacket and a retro Baker Boy cap, which almost hid his salt and pepper hair.

Keeping things decidedly low-key, Kate Moss’s ex-fiance would have been cutting a solitary figure were it not for man’s best friend.

The rocker’s Siberian dogs walked beside him on leads looking well-behaved, four months after a neighbour claimed they’d killed her eight-year-old cat Archie.

While it’s not clear what Pete’s big birthday plans involve this week, the frontman is working up to his European tour with new band Peter Doherty and The Puta Madres.

Even rockstars need to walk the dog (Picture: Splash News)

The ensemble is releasing a debut album next month, and the band will be on the road by May.

Shows include Bristol, Manchester, London and Leeds before Paris, Vienna and Berlin.

The lead single from the self-titled album, called Who’s Been Having You Over, was quietly released back in January with new music from The Libertines expected in 2020.

With a busy year ahead, the Libertines star is said to have beaten his addiction demons after his last reported rehab stint in 2014.

Writing a letter from the Hope Rehab Centre in Thailand, Pete said he spoke frankly about his 10-year public struggle with cocaine and heroin addiction.

The singer describes said he wanted to get clean many times during his addiction, but didn’t know how.

Pete is said to have settled on the southeast coast in the last few years.

He quit the London life for Paris back in 2008, but quickly moved away from the chaotic French capital in favour of the peaceful town of Melun.

In 2015, he admitted to living a pretty boring existence, spending time going to antique markets and playing petanque.

CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett walked back into court in Chicago Tuesday morning, days after he was charged with 16 felony counts related to that alleged hoax.The judge ruled to allow cameras in the courtroom during Thursday's court hearing. After the case is assigned to a judge, that judge will rule on whether cameras can be in the court for future proceedings.Smollett's attorney said he welcomes cameras.""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstratively false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we see as the actual lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" said Tina Glandian, attorney for Smollett, after the hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.The ""Empire"" actor will return to court on Thursday when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood in January, but police said it was a hoax and that Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the fake attack.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years.

After the case is assigned to a judge, that judge will rule on whether cameras can be in the court for future proceedings.Smollett's attorney said he welcomes cameras.""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstratively false.

""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on ""Empire"" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors said Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the ""Empire"" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:"

Jussie Smollett is so keen to be an active participant in defending the 16 charges currently filed against him, the Empire actor strutted into a hearing he didn’t have to attend today.

The actor, who is facing 16 Class 4 Felony charges for disorderly conduct for filing a false report, walked into the Cook County Courthouse on Tuesday ahead of his entourage, seeming strong in his stance.

The 36-year-old had been laying low since his arrest earlier this month, however he made an appearance wearing shades, gloves and a trench coat as several members of his team trailed behind.

According to TMZ today’s hearing was for his attorney, Mark Geragos, to file the paperwork so he can represent the actor and his case in Illinois.

While Chicago’s Sun Times claimed today’s hearing was to decide whether to allow cameras in the courtroom during proceedings in the upcoming case.

It comes after Smollett was originally charged with one Class 4 Felony charge for disorderly conduct for filing a false report, after claiming two men attacked him last month in a hate crime.

In an 86-page indictment filed by a grand jury, that charge was then applied 15 times over, meaning he now faces 16 felony counts. He has denied all allegations against him.

While each charge doesn’t potentially mean additional time in prison, each one does carry a maximum probation sentence of four years.

He’s now potentially facing a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation.

It comes after his ‘attackers’ this week confirmed he paid them to ‘stage an attack’ earlier this year.

Brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo have been accused of helping Smollett stage a hate crime after he allegedly paid them $3500 (£2,600) for a nutrition and fitness program, or so says the cheque which has been released.

However, their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, appeared on Good Morning America on Monday and claimed that although the brothers were helping Smollett to get fit for an upcoming music video, the payment was also a ‘favour to stage the attack’.

Smollett was allegedly attacked by two masked men in Chicago, with reports stating his attackers had ‘beaten him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him’.

The actor received treatment following the attack and had reported the incident to Chicago Police, with the authorities treating it as a ‘hate crime’ after his attackers allegedly hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him throughout.

12:32 PM PT -- The judge sided with Geragos and will allow cameras in the courtroom Thursday.

Jussie Smollett strutted confidently into a Cook County Courthouse for a hearing he did NOT have to attend.

Jussie, who's been laying low since he was arrested for filing a false police report, was rocking shades, gloves and a trench coat as he arrived Tuesday. The hearing is really for his attorney, Mark Geragos, to file the paperwork so he can rep Jussie in Illinois -- and also to determine if cameras will be allowed in court for the case.

He wasn't required to be there, but our sources say Smollett chose to attend because he intends to be an active participant in his defense ... and not just an observer. We're also told he's done hiding.

This is the first time we've seen him after the grand jury handed up the 16 count indictment last week.

After the indictment, Geragos told us, ""The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie."""

A lawyer for Jussie Smollett said Tuesday that she would welcome cameras in the courtroom during the ""Empire"" actor's trial on charges accusing him of lying to police, saying there has been a lot of leaked misinformation and that cameras would allow the public to ""see the evidence and the lack thereof.""

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Thursday.

Judge Leroy Martin said the judge picked to oversee the trial would decide whether cameras would be allowed during the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is ""demonstrably false.""

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" she said.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett's attorneys have called the charges ""prosecutorial overkill."" The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence."

The Empire cast and crew are sweating over the prospect of being renewed for a sixth season, and many believe Smollett could tip the show into cancellation. According to TMZ, there is no news yet on a sixth season renewal for the aging hit. This is unusual because Fox has almost always renewed the show by now.

“We’re told people who’ve been working on the show for years are griping they should’ve heard the news one way or another by now, and expected to get word on the fate of the show around 2 weeks ago,” TMZ reports.

But this might be much ado about nothing. Last season, Fox waited even longer to renew, which makes sense for a show that is slipping in the ratings (only five to six million tuned in last season compared to the 16 to 17 million who watched season one) and undoubtedly costs a fortune to produce. Of course, the stigma of the scandal is not helping.

Jussie Smollett has been charged with 16 felonies. Police say the 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, orchestrated a hate crime against himself. In late January, Smollett told police he was assaulted by two white men in red hats. After they poured bleach on his black skin and wrapped a noose around his neck, he claims they yelled “This is MAGA country!” a direct reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Police say two black men confessed to accosting Smollett, but that the actor paid them $3500 to do so.

Basically, Fox is facing the prospect of spending $3 to $5 million (educated guess) per episode and wondering if it’s worth it, so it makes sense for them to see how the scandal affects the ratings for the second half of the fifth season, which hits the airwaves Wednesday.

On top of the ratings and Smollett scandal, another mark against Empire is its serialized story, which means there is almost no money to be made in syndication by producing additional episodes. People who watch reruns want self-contained episodes, which is why Law & Order will rerun forever but you never see Dallas or Dynasty, or Lost or The Shield. It makes sense for NBC to drive Law & Order: SVU into the ground; every episode produced will generate a ton of money in perpetuity through syndication. Empire’s only ancillary hopes are Netflix and a “complete series” DVD collection.

Also of interest in the TMZ report is the news that “even if Fox does renew the show, higher-ups have expressed serious reservations about Jussie returning … as have many folks on the cast and crew … even some who have publicly supported him.”

Smollett was removed from the last few episodes of season five and now there is talk of replacing his character with another actor or writing him out completely.

Basically, Fox is in a no-win situation. A short 7 to 10 episode final season to tie the story up is probably the best way to go."

Their attorney Gloria Schmidt told CBS they are working to “to pick up the pieces of what this has done to their lives.”

“They did not know their loyalty to him would be betrayed,” Schmidt said. “They find themselves in a situation where they are tremendously regretful.”

Smollett was indicted on Thursday (March 7) by the State Attorney’s Office on 16 felony counts. Chicago Police Department got Smollett for disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to two separate police officers about the incident.

The openly gay actor told investigators he was attacked as he was walking home around 2 a.m. on January 29. He claimed two, masked white men battered him while yelling out homophobic and racists slurs.

Following an investigation led by the CPD, it was discovered Jussie planned the melee because he was reportedly unhappy about his Empire salary. Smollett allegedly directed the Osundairo brothers to purchase the noose, MAGA hat, and masks at an Uptown hardware store to use in the staged incident. It was also found Jussie paid them $3500 by check to make it happen.

“They feel tremendously regretful for their role in this, and their involvement in the situation,” Schmidt said. “The impact that this has had – not only on them, but on minority populations – that weighs very heavily on them.”

According to Schmidt, the Osundairo brothers hope to turn this incident into a positive one.

The former Empire actor is currently free on bond and is set to be arraigned March 14."

10:13 AM PT — A judge has ruled that cameras will be allowed in the courtroom for future hearings involving Jussie Smollett.

Jussie Smollett confidently strode into court as the judge in his criminal case prepares to decide whether the media will be allowed inside the courtroom for his hearings.

The ""Empire"" star wore a long jacket with aviator shades, and kept his silence as he walked with an entourage in tow, including new attorney Mark Geragos. Smollett is expected to be arraigned this week on the 16 counts he was recently hit with, alleging his orchestration of the infamous hoax.

He was not required to appear Tuesday morning, but Smollett still showed up, even though he is not expected to fight any order about cameras in the courtroom.

As we reported, the attorney for the Nigerian brothers who testified against Smollett, sat down with ""GMA"" this week and claimed the actor took advantage of her clients."

Smollett arrived in court just after 11 a.m. Tuesday. A spokeswoman for his attorneys said Smollett wanted to ""show up and show respect to the court,"" though his appearance wasn't required.

""He wants to hold his head up high, show confidence in his innocence,"" Anne Kavanagh said, adding that he plans to ""go the extra mile"" to prove his innocence.

""He's not hiding from anything,"" she said. ""He will do everything he needs to do.""

Smollett's defense attorneys did not argue with the decision to allow cameras in court Thursday, saying there has been a lot of ""misinformation"" in the case and they welcome cameras during the hearing and all future proceedings. Prosecutors also did not object to the decision.

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is actually going to be a lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett,"" Tina Glandian said after the hearing.

Glandian and another attorney for Smollet, Mark Geragos, filed motions Monday requesting to be allowed to represent Smollett in Cook County court, as neither are members of the Illinois State Bar Association.

A Cook County grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts Friday in connection with his reporting of the alleged attack he claimed to have suffered in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. Police alleged Smollett staged the attack, hiring two brothers who worked on ""Empire"" to execute it, because he was unhappy with his salary.

The lawyer for the brothers, Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, said Monday that the pair has evidence backing their claim that he orchestrated the assault.

Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America that the brothers have ""tremendous regret...over their involvement in the situation.""

""I think once Mark Geragos and everyone starts looking into this situation, they're going to see really that my clients were just taken advantage of by someone that they trusted,"" she said.

When asked if the brothers had evidence to back their explosive claims that changed the trajectory of the case, Schmidt said ""of course.""

""And that's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.

In a later interview with Access Hollywood, Schmidt said her clients cooperated with Chicago police immediately and presented evidence that was investigated. That same day, the duo walked out of the police department. Schmidt said the brothers thought they were helping a friend who would in turn help their careers.

""The issue here is that they were in a position with a friend who said, 'Let's basically pay you for training and then do a favor for me,'"" she said.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in filing a false report on Friday, court documents show. All 16 counts are Class 4 felonies, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of one-to-three years in prison. Probation is also possible.

The indictment issued by the grand jury lays out two separate sets of charges against the actor. The first set alleges that Smollett lied to responding officers immediately following the reported attack.

Specifically, the charges allege that Smollett made false statements about the nature of the attack, telling officers that the attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him, according to the indictment.

The second set of charges alleges that Smollett made false statements to detectives in a follow-up interview about the case.

""Allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful and if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor and respected him as a role model,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. ""We stand behind the work of our detectives.""

Smollett's attorneys said they will ""push back against"" the charges filed against their client, with Geragos later releasing a statement saying the indictment was ""not unexpected.""

""What is unexpected however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie,"" Geragos said. ""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records.""

""Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" he said.

Smollett was previously charged in February with one felony count of disorderly conduct in filing a false police report.

Chicago police said in a press conference announcing the initial charge that Smollett sent a ""false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself and staged a hate crime attack in Chicago because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""

At the time, authorities investigating the reported attack as a hate crime said new information ""shifted"" their investigation of the alleged assault, in which Smollett told authorities he was physically attacked as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in late January.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's legal team said in a statement when he was initially charged. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Smollett is due back in court on March 14."

I wanted to see the movie in much the same way that the average viewer did.

Like most people who viewed it, I was emotionally impacted by the horrific nature of the alleged abuse, but was eventually turned off by the obvious unfairness of allowing two unverified accusers being allowed four hours, with the support of tremendously manipulative production elements, to make un-scrutinized claims against an un-convicted dead man (who, it should also be noted, paid $20 million to a 13-year-old accuser in the 1990s as part of a settlement out of court). As someone who had long suspected Michael Jackson was likely guilty of child abuse, but whose own coverage of his 2005 trial as a Los Angeles talk show host made me actually start to doubt that presumption, the whole thing was conflicting.

Since I absolutely despise that I have somehow become known as someone who is willing to defend those accused of sex abuse even though we live in an era where such an act, regardless of the facts of the particular situation, makes you automatically a “bad” person, I was extremely hesitant to delve further into the matter. However, even my initial evaluation of the voluminous record involving the movie’s two stars, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, made it very clear that the movie was a journalistic travesty, and that someone should be willing to take a stand against the prevailing narrative on behalf of truth and fairness.

As is always the case, before I eventually dove in headfirst, I engaged in extensive research on these claims, and spoke to several people with direct knowledge of the other side of the story. I did lengthy in-person interviews with two key members of the Jackson family. One of them, Brandi Jackson, had dated Robson throughout their entire teenage years, including during the time when the abuse was allegedly occurring.

One of the many difficulties in telling a version of events which is contradictory to someone the news media — as opposed to the courts — has determined is a “sex abuse victim” (especially those who, like Robson and Safechuck, have been sanctified by Oprah Winfrey on HBO) is that, particularly post #MeToo, no one data point can ever been seen as a “smoking gun” that their allegation is false. However, when viewed in the full context of Robson’s already suspect narrative, I strongly believe that Brandi’s version of events comes as close as possible to being just that (as do many other non-Jackson fans who have spent the time to hear her, and her cousin Taj, out).

In a remotely rational world, where the news media still even plausibly functioned as a source of truth, and where basic fairness still had any real currency, Brandi would have immediately been invited on multiple major television news outlets (heck, her story even involves a normally irresistible tidbit about Robson cheating on her with Britney Spears, thus causing her infamous breakup with Justin Timberlake). However, to the mild surprise of even a grizzled media cynic like me, that did not happen.

Even before our interview, multiple members of the Jackson family told me that they felt like the major news media was purposely censoring Brandi’s explosive story. I told them that it was possible that the media just may not fully understand the significance what she has to say (none of which, it should be noted, has never been contradicted at all by Robson, or anyone else), but I now must conclude that I was being naïve.

To be clear, I am not alleging some sort of anti-Jackson conspiracy, but actually something far more treacherous than that. Based on the news media’s unwillingness to even give Brandi a voice, it is now abundantly obvious that a new media rule has been created that no one, no matter how credible, unless they are huge celebrity, is allowed to directly contradict the veracity of someone the media is invested in as a “victim,” no matter how lacking in credibility that allegation is (and to be clear, books could easily be written on why the current story of Robson, who enthusiastically testified as Jackson’s first witness at his criminal trial, is not to be believed).

Within the news media, there is just far too much fear/risk, and not nearly courage/reward. So, here is what really happened in this situation…

Michael Jackson has always been suspected of being capable of literally anything because of his obvious extreme weirdness and seemingly inappropriate attachments to young boys. A filmmaker with an obvious agenda interviewed two middle-aged men for several days and ignored the many problems with their stories (for the record, a close look at the movie discredits huge chunks of Safechuck’s narrative as well, especially with regard to the real circumstances surrounding him not testifying at Jackson’s criminal trial), using about the first three hours to get his audience emotionally invested in his subjects, which was very easy given the widely-held suspicions about Jackson, who is no longer around to defend himself.

Not being armed with even the basic facts (inexplicably, and quite tellingly, Brandi Jackson is not even mentioned), the audience, including the media, was easily manipulated into being able to disregard even the biggest holes in their stories, and to gladly accept even the most bizarre rationalizations for their nonsensical actions. Once Oprah, an abuse victim herself, effectively validated their stories (even as Safechuck, who barely participated in the post-movie interview, sweated noticeably right in front of her), the preferred narrative was set, and nothing would then be allowed to credibly contradict it.

It needs to at least be mentioned that the most bizarre aspect of the news media embracing this movie is, because of the narrative used to explain why the accusers didn’t realize they were abused much sooner, it actually has elements which are arguably PRO pedophilia. This “we didn’t think sex abuse was bad” explanation could have been simply a result of the accusers having to craft their stories to escape statute of limitations problems in their lawsuit against the Jackson estate.

Regardless, there is no need to give the Jackson family much of a chance to respond — or even see the movie before it came out — because, after all, we now know for sure that they are just part of an evil machine which is knowingly covering up for a dead pedophile, all in a desperate attempt to protect the value of the pop superstar’s estate. Gee, what could possibly go wrong with that sort of thinking, especially since Jackson was never convicted, or even found liable, in a court of law?!

Part of my naïveté here was that I stupidly thought the Jussie Smollett fake hate-crime fiasco would have, at least for a few months, made the news media a little more hesitant to blindly buy into outlandish stories with no proof and a clear financial motive. Obviously, that has not happened, and it is because the modern news media, for many reasons, is now completely, irreparably, and dangerously broken.

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett wasn't required to be there, but he showed up at a Chicago hearing to discuss whether cameras will be allowed in the courtroom during his disorderly conduct case.

Smollett was joined by his lawyers and some family members at Tuesday's hearing in Cook County criminal court.

A grand jury indicted Smollett last week on 16 felony counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett walked back into court in Chicago Tuesday morning, days after he was charged with 16 felony counts related to that alleged hoax.The judge ruled to allow cameras in the courtroom during Thursday's court hearing.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Thursday.

Judge Leroy Martin said the judge picked to oversee the trial would decide whether cameras would be allowed during the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is ""demonstrably false.""

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" she said.

Smollett is charged with 16 counts accusing him of lying to the police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett's attorneys have called the charges ""prosecutorial overkill."" The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence."

And the thought that someone would write a check to pay for a staged racist and homophobic is not only unusual, it’s not smart. So when the Chicago Police Department said that Jussie Smollett wrote Ola and Abel Osundairo a check to stage an attack against him, it just didn’t make sense.

In actuality, Smollett did write a check. According to TMZ, in the memo portion of the check in question, Smollett wrote it as training and a nutrition program. While the police department claimed the check was for the attack, the brother themselves have now confirmed that the check for $3,500 was indeed for those services.

In a news conference, Eddie Johnson said, “Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago’s reputation through the mud in the process.”

The check was not only one of the strongest claims made by the Chicago PD, as far as we know it’s the only piece of evidence pointing toward a staged attack.

Gloria Schmidt, the attorney for the Osundairo brothers, spoke on their behalf on “Good Morning America” said that the check was to get Jussie in shape of a music video.

The Nigerian brothers Jussie Smollett allegedly hired to stage his attack is now accusing the singer/actor of taking advantage of their friendship.

The Empire star has been charged with 16 felony counts for reportedly lying to police about being assaulted by racists outside his apartment in Chicago, Illinois on 29 January.

Authorities initially began investigating Smollett’s claims as a suspected hate crime, but then turned their attentions to the 36 year old’s actions after questioning brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo as potential suspects. The siblings claim Smollett paid them to help him pull off the hoax after meeting through his work on the FOX drama series ‘Empire,’ and they were subsequently released without charge.

Smollett has vehemently denied the accusations, but now Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the Osundairos, has slammed the actor for reportedly involving her clients in the fake attack.

“My clients were just taken advantage of by someone they trusted,” Schmidt told Good Morning America. “This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career… Someone they had trusted to consider their best interests.”

Investigators believe a $3,500 check Smollett cut to the siblings, listed as payment for a five-week nutrition and workout program for a forthcoming music video, was actually intended as compensation for beating the star up – allegations Schmidt backs up.

“They were paid for the training… but they were also asked to do this favor for him…,” she said. “The favor was to stage the attack.”

Schmidt insists her clients regret participating in the purported hoax, and are doing their best to move forward in a “positive direction.”

Just one of the felony charges carries a three-year sentence behind bars if Smollett is convicted, which means Smollett could potentially spend decades in jail. He is set to be arraigned on Thursday."

According to NBC News, the FBI and prosecutors in Boston have charged 50 people, including “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman and “Fuller House” star Lori Loughlin, for mail fraud in the scheme.

BREAKING / NBC NEWS: Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are two of over 40 people charged in the college exam scheme, according to court documents. They are charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. https://t.co/vLfjUuOpHA — Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) March 12, 2019

The plot allegedly involved parents paying bribes of up to $6 million, ABC News reported, in order to get their children into elite schools.

Students were allegedly admitted as students regardless of athletic ability, and received help cheating on entrance exams.

The indictment explained: “Beginning in or about 2011, and continuing through the present, the defendants — principally individuals whose high-school-age children were applying to college — conspired with others to use bribery and other forms of fraud to facilitate their children’s admission to colleges and universities in the District of Massachusetts and elsewhere, including Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California, and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.”

Huffman allegedly “made a purported charitable contribution of $15,000… to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter. Huffman later made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so.”

A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed to ET that Felicity Huffman was arrested this morning without incident at her Los Angeles area home. The actress, who is among other defendants involved in the college admissions bribery scam, is scheduled to appear at U.S. District Court in Los Angeles around 2 p.m. this afternoon.

The spokeswoman also told ET that Lori Loughlin has not been taken into custody yet. When federal agents went to Loughlin’s L.A. home this morning she was not there. Federal agents were informed Loughlin is out of town. An arrest warrant is out for her arrest.

Loughlin and her husband allegedly “agreed to pay bribes totalling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC.”

A police officer from Scotland has caused quite a headache for himself after he confessed to another police officer to fictitious sex crimes he did not commit.

It all started last spring when 51-year-old Ryan Ballard created a profile on the online chat forum ChatStop. In his profile, he claimed to be a bisexual married man with two sons ages 11 and 15 and a daughter who was nine.

He then proceeded to engage in at least three conversations with an undercover police officer, during which he confessed to engaging in inappropriate behavior with his daughter, detailing all the things he had done sexually with her.

The conversations carried on from May to August of last year before the undercover officer finally alerted the department’s Internet Investigations Unit. Ballard was swiftly suspended from his job, arrested, and charged.

And this is where things take a bizarre turn.

It didn’t take investigators long to realize that Ballard was lying. Though he was married at the time and he does identify as bisexual, he doesn’t have any kids, nor did he ever molest any nine-year-olds.

He basically just made the whole thing up.

Why? Nobody knows. Not even Ballard, it seems.

Ballard resigned from his job and pleaded guilty to a charge of sending offensive messages and sexually explicit messages in regards to sexual activity with a minor.

Prior to this week’s sentencing, Ballard’s attorney, Lynn Beaumont, asked the court for leniency, stating her client was a first-time offender and there has a low risk of him reoffending.

“He stays with his family in the attic and is isolated,” she told the court. “He has lost many friends and colleagues as a result of this offense and the ability to integrate with others.”

Beaumont also noted that he has since split up with his wife and he no longer uses the internet.

“He is disgusted by his behavior,” she said."

“What I can tell you right now is the tremendous regret that they have over their involvement in this situation,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview Monday with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on “Good Morning America.”

…

The brothers’ attorney said the check from Smollett was payment for both the personal training and their help in staging the attack.

“They were training together and so they were paid for that, but they were also asked to do this favor for him,” Schmidt said in the “GMA” interview Monday morning.

CHICAGO -- A lawyer for Jussie Smollett said Tuesday that she would welcome cameras in the courtroom during the ""Empire"" actor's trial on charges accusing him of lying to the police, saying there has been a lot of leaked misinformation and cameras would allow the public to ""see the evidence and the lack thereof.""

Attorney Tina Glandian made the comments during a brief hearing Tuesday in Cook County criminal court during which both sides agreed that cameras would be allowed at the next hearing in the case, which is scheduled for Thursday.

Judge LeRoy Martin, Jr. said Tuesday that the new judge will decide whether or not to allow cameras in the courtroom during subsequent hearings and the trial.

After the hearing, Glandian told reporters that evidence has been presented against Smollett that is ""demonstrably false.""

""We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" she said.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct -the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police - because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

Chief Cook County Criminal Courts Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. on Tuesday said he will allow one still camera and one video camera at the hearing Thursday.

He noted that he will also assign the case to another judge and that judge will determine whether cameras will be allowed in future hearings.

One of Smollett’s attorneys, Tina Glandian, said she didn’t have any objections to media access because “much of the leaked information is actually demonstrably false.”

“There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett which is demonstrably false,” Glandian later told reporters. “We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence — and what we believe is actually going to be the lack of evidence — against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out.”

Smollett was in court for the hearing Tuesday, the first time since his arrest.

The “Empire” actor requested permission to leave the state this month to visit California, where his attorney, Mark Geragos, is based. Glandian is a lawyer from Geragos’ firm.

Smollett faces 16 counts of disorderly conduct tied to statements to police describing an attack by two men whom he claimed shouted homophobic and racist comments at the actor, who is black and openly gay. Smollett said he was walking home from a 2 a.m. trip to a Subway restaurant near his Streeterville apartment on Jan. 29, when his attackers hit him and draped a thin rope noose around his neck.

Police pieced together surveillance camera footage that led them to Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and his brother, Abindola “Abel” Osundairo, bodybuilding brothers who had worked with Smollett as extras on “Empire” and as a fitness coach. But after two days in custody as suspects in the attack, the brothers told police Smollett planned the fake attack and paid them $3,500 to carry it out. After an investigation that lasted longer than three weeks, prosecutors charged Smollett with making a false report.

The actor left court after his bond hearing in February after posting $100,000 and headed to an “Empire” shoot. The next day, the show’s producers announced that Smollett’s character had been written off the final two episodes of the show.

The fifth season of “Empire” premieres on Wednesday.

“We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we believe is the lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,” she said.

Smollett was charged last month with one count of misconduct —the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — because he allegedly lied to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Last week, a grand jury indicted him on 16 counts of the same crime.

Prosecutors allege that Smollett, who is black and gay, enlisted the help of two other black men and staged the Jan. 29 attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Those men have admitted to police that they took part in the staged attack for Smollett, who paid them $3,500.

Smollett’s attorneys have called 16 counts “prosecutorial overkill.” The actor, who is free on bond, maintains his innocence.

Jussie Smollett is expected to appear in Chicago court on Tuesday — days after he was hit with a 16-count indictment for allegedly lying about his hate attack.

The judge in the case will consider a motion from the media on whether to allow cameras in the courtroom during future proceedings, according to ABC Chicago.

The embattled “Empire” actor isn’t required to appear for the 11:30 a.m. hearing but a source told the network that he will be there.

The defense doesn’t plan to object to the motion.

Smollett’s arraignment is scheduled for Thursday.

On Friday, he was indicted on felony charges of disorderly conduct for lying to police that he was the victim of a hate crime outside his apartment in January."

Kelly’s life got even worse after his interview with Gayle King. Now, his so-called crisis manager said he thinks the interview was a success.

Darrell Johnson spoke with Don Lemon on CNN Monday night and said he thought Kelly’s interview was “helpful.” He also defended the 52-year-old outrageous outburst during the interview.

“I mean, how do you act when you’re going to spend the rest of your life in prison? I thought it was a real moment,” Johnson said. “I think the interview needed to happen, I really do believe it.”

Johnson, who specializes in crisis public relations, also added, “There are several things that happened, that followed after that. So yes, I think it did help him. I don’t think the emotions were going so high. I think he was just being himself.”

When comes to the accusations from the Kelly’s accusers, Johnson said, he is “not calling anybody a liar.”

Johnson has only been working with Kelly for three weeks. Between Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, and his publicist, Kelly is probably going to spend many years behind bars.

Watch below:

Kelly appeared to agree with Johnson. TMZ reported that Kelly’s “spirit” told him to do the interview and he has begun writing new music in order to not have a mental breakdown.

While being interviewed by King last week, Kelly offered implausible answers when he was questioned about his past with underage girls.

“I beat my case,” he cried to King in reference to his 2008 acquittal on child porn charges. “When you beat something, you beat it. You can’t double-jeopardy me like that. You can’t. It’s not fair. It’s not fair to nobody!”

The charges Kelly is facing in 2019 are different from the 2008 charges for child pornography. Nonetheless, the singer maintains his innocence.

“Not true,” Kelly said when King asked him about “the other cases where women have come forward and said, ‘R. Kelly had sex with me when I was under the age of 18. R. Kelly was abusive to me emotionally and physically and verbally. R. Kelly took me in a black room where unspeakable things happened.’ This is what they’re saying about you.”

Kelly got extremely emotional, saying, “Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to, love me if you want. But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through. … Quit playing! I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me! I’m fighting for my f*cking life!”

Increased interest in seeing Kelly charged for his alleged crimes came at the beginning of the year when the bombshell docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” aired with several women accusing him of sexually abusing them when they were underage.

R. Kelly has been charged with ten counts of felony sexual abuse.

Yep, sounds about a white.

Leanne (she does not want her last name released but we are sure Twitter will do its research) reportedly crossed a barrier at an Arizona zoo to get a selfie with a jaguar. Thankfully, she only suffered lacerations on her arm but she is now speaking out and pointing fingers at the zoo, according to the Daily Mail.

“The black jaguar was up against the fence and we happened to be walking by and we said, ‘Hey let’s get some good pictures,'” Leanne explained.

She continued, “I was in the wrong for leaning over the barrier, but I do think that maybe the zoo should look into moving their fence back. Anybody can reach out. I’m not the first, and if they don’t move the fence, I’m probably not going to be the last.”

If anyone decided to lean over a barrier of a wild animal there is no one to blame.

There is a 3-foot barrier, which is more than enough space to know not to be an idiot. That said, CBS also reported, “the same thing happened at this same enclosure with the same jaguar just last summer. Jeff Allan received several stitches, and said the zoo put its barrier too close.”

Zoo director Mickey Olson said in a statement to CBS, “When people do not respect the barriers, there’s always a chance that there might be a problem.” Directly after the incident, he said, “There’s no way to fix people crossing barriers. That happens occasionally. We put substantial barriers there, and if people cross them, they can get in trouble.”

The jaguar has been temporarily removed from the exhibit. There were fears that the jaguar would be euthanized due to the incident, but the zoo released the following statement, “We can promise you nothing will happen to our jaguar. She’s a wild animal and there were proper barriers in place to keep our guests safe- not a wild animals fault when barriers are crossed. Still sending prayers to her and her family.”

He's already been written out of the last two episodes of Empire , but Jussie Smollett's arrest could have an affect on the fate of the entire show.

The US TV series, which is currently in its fifth season, has yet to be officially renewed by FOX for its sixth, and according to TMZ , staff are worried about their jobs.

Sources from the show have reportedly said that ""anxiety is high"" over the delay as several other shows on the same network have already been told of their continuation or cancellation.

TMZ also indicates that even if the show is renewed for a sixth season, Empire bosses have ""expressed serious reservations"" about Jussie returning to the show after his character Jamal was removed from the end of the series.

Production on the show believe that Jussie's arrest, for allegedly staging a racially motivated and homophobic attack on himself, will have a significant impact on the TV executives' decision.

Jussie has been charged with 16 felony counts of felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

If found guilty he faces a maximum sentence of three years behind bars, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation and is currently out on $100,000 bail.

""I believe my clients were betrayed,"" Gloria Schmidt said on CNN's ""AC 360,"" referring to brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. ""You have to look at what kind of relationship they had with Mr. Smollett. He's a celebrity. This is somebody who is in a position of power over my clients.""

She added: ""We've seen a lot of stories in the news where celebrities think they might be above the law. It's just not the case.""

Smollett reported to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago in an incident that ended with a noose around his neck. Police initially investigated the case as a possible hate crime.

Mark Geragos, Smollett's attorney, spoke with Anderson Cooper on Friday and said Smollett refused to sign a police complaint after the incident because ""he could not believe it.""

""I haven't' seen one piece of evidence and they don't have one piece of evidence that they've turned over that links Jussie to this,"" Geragos said, referring to allegations that the attack was orchestrated.

Smollett, an actor on the Fox drama ""Empire,"" was recently indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County grand jury.

The counts in the indictment obtained by CNN say Smollett gave statements to a Chicago police officer after the incident and to a detective. Details in some of those statements were different, the indictment says.

The indictment says Smollett told police he was attacked by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs during an encounter at 2 a.m.

After police detained the two brothers, who were described as ""persons of interest"" in mid-February, police sources revealed that authorities suspected Smollett knew the men and had paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. The men were released without being charged.

Smollett has denied any involvement in orchestrating an attack.

Schmidt, the attorney for the brothers, said her law firm did its own investigation.

""We were able to fish it out, if you will, and tell the commander there's something that doesn't match with the narrative that had been put out by Mr. Smollett,"" she said.

She said the brothers and Smollett met through a working relationship.

""They were (fitness) trainers; they were training him,"" she said.

She said the younger brother had known Smollett ""a couple years"" before this incident.

Schmidt sidestepped answering direct questions from Cooper about the $3,500.

""The training ... was something that was pre-discussed prior to January 29. It was cashed; it was deposited. ... These are details that came out with my clients fully cooperating with the police,"" she said.

When asked if the check had anything to do with the attack, Schmidt said it's not a ""clear-cut answer.""

""You have to look at they were friends and the money did include services for training, but you have to look at it within the context of 'I'm this star and you're someone who I can help and I would like to pay you for something and oh, can you do me this favor.' So was it for training? Was it not for training? I think it's a little bit of both,"" she said.

She said her clients are remorseful for their role in the situation and they hope it opens dialogue for people in minority communities and those that have suffered hate crimes.

""They feel regretful that they put their trust in the wrong person,"" she said."

The following day, series star Jussie Smollett will be arraigned in Chicago for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself.

The turn of events that left the Hollywood community and “Empire” fans stunned has cast a pall over the midseason premiere and left those at Fox Broadcasting and studio 20th Century Fox Television waiting with bated breath. According to multiple sources, it had been widely expected that “Empire” would be renewed for a sixth season and the show still enjoys support at both the network and studio. That’s not surprising, considering that even in its fifth season it remains one of the highest-rated shows on Fox. Season to date, “Empire” is averaging a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 in the Nielsen Live+7 numbers, making it the number two scripted show on the network behind only “9-1-1.”

But much hinges on the outcome of Smollett’s current legal predicament. “Empire’s” executive producers announced shortly after Smollett was arrested that his character would be written out of the final two episodes of Season 5. They said this was done so that the show, which is currently in its final week of production on the season, could “avoid further disruption on set.” Many options are on the table regarding Smollett and his character, Jamal Lyon. Sources tell Vt is possible the character could be killed off or the role could be recast.

It also appears that Smollett’s role in the remainder of the season is being downplayed, despite Jamal’s engagement being a major storyline in the first half of Season 5. Except for a midseason recap video released in the beginning of March, none of the promotional clips for the second half of Season 5 released since Smollett’s arrest have prominently featured him, rather offering just fleeting glimpses of Jamal. One Fox insider downplayed this, however, saying that it is common for such clips to focus more heavily on series stars Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard.

Smollett has been indicted on 16 counts of filing a false police report. The actor and musician claimed that he was the victim of an assault in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago, stating two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him, poured bleach on him, and placed a rope around his neck. Smollett also said that the two men used the phrase “MAGA country” during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump and his “Make America Great Again” slogan.

However, investigators now believe Smollett paid two acquaintances — brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — to help him stage the attack. Police previously arrested the brothers, but they were later released without being charged. They are now cooperating with the investigation.

During a press conference the Chicago PD stated they believed Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on “Empire.” They also said they believe Smollett had sent a threatening letter to himself that was received at “Empire’s” Chicago production office days before the attack. Smollett and his representatives have repeatedly denied the allegations.

After Empire star Jussie Smollett was charged with 16 counts when — according to Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson — he filed a false police report, alleging a hate crime, many were perplexed and even outraged. Sixteen counts? Six-teen?!

Smollett claimed back in January that he was attacked in Chicago by two masked men, yelling gay and racial slurs and saying “this is MAGA country.” The actor also said the men poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck.

Smollett’s allegations were initially met with support and concern, as well as a police investigation. But soon after the investigation began, leaks from the police department slowly emerged, ultimately leading to serious questions concerning Smollett’s story and ultimately charges against Smollett.

Superintendent Johnson believed Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack in order to bring attention to his discontentment with his Empire salary. He angrily accused Smollett of needlessly taking precious resources away from Chicago’s citizens, even though Smollett has continuously denied that he staged an attack.

The 16-count indictment is excessive and appears vindictive given the circumstances.

News outlets published that Smollett was on his phone with his manager when the attack occurred; he refused to turn over his cell phone to police; and he waited some time after the attack to seek medical attention. It wasn’t long before local police issued an arrest warrant for Smollett for one count of filing a false police report. And in recent days, Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of falsifying a police report by a grand jury in Chicago.

That said, the 16-count indictment is excessive and appears vindictive given the circumstances. The indictment includes one count for each alleged lie Smollett told police during his two interviews as the grand jury essentially counted each part of his story individually. Each charge carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, and the fact Smollett can face 64 years in prison for his alleged hoax is clear overkill.

Mark Geragos, Smollett’s attorney, said the indictment is “redundant and vindictive.” I couldn’t agree more.

Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images

The grand jury process is one-sided in that it only includes the prosecutor. Neither the defendant nor his attorney participate in the proceeding; and the evidence shown to the grand jury is solely within the discretion of the prosecutor. In fact, the entire process is done in secret. This is why attorneys usually say prosecutors can indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to.

The Smollett case raises serious questions for the Chicago Police Department; a department already struggling with a sullied reputation after police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of shooting 17 -year-old Black teen, Laquan McDonald, and an extensive cover-up. He was later sentenced to six years in prison. Three Chicago Police Department officers were tried for allegedly attempting to cover up events related to the shooting, and were found not guilty by a judge on January 17, 2019.

Two years before, the Department of Justice issued a scathing report saying that the Chicago Police Department engaged in excessive force and unfair treatment of minorities.

Smollett may, like Van Dyke, spend time in prison for his actions. Neither prison term is likely to resolve community mistrust in the embattled department, and its ever present issues concerning Chicago race relations. However Van Dyke’s recent sentencing suggests that the Chicago Police Department has sullied its reputation singlehandedly.

Despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence against Smollett, and in support of the allegations that he falsified a report, community erosion of trust in the police department remains high — just take a look at social media comments, which suggest continued support for Smollett’s story.

If anything, fans and commenters are more untrustworthy of the Chicago Police Department than they are of an actor’s story."

CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett walked back into court in Chicago Tuesday morning, days after he was charged with 16 felony counts related to that alleged hoax.The judge ruled to allow cameras in the courtroom during Thursday's court hearing. After the case is assigned to a judge, that judge will rule on whether cameras can be in the court for future proceedings.Smollett's attorney said he welcomes cameras.""There has been a lot of misinformation in this case that has been presented as fact and evidence against Mr. Smollett, which is demonstratively false. We welcome cameras in the courtroom so that the public and the media can see the actual evidence and what we see as the actual lack of evidence against Mr. Smollett and we look forward to complete transparency and the truth coming out,"" said Tina Glandian, attorney for Smollett, after the hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.The ""Empire"" actor will return to court on Thursday when he is expected to enter a formal plea on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood in January, but police said it was a hoax and that Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the fake attack.Attorney Gloria Schmidt told Good Morning America in an interview Monday morning that Smollett was ""in a position of trust"" with the Osundairo brothers.""They worked with Jussie, they had known him, they were friends with him,"" Schmidt said. ""This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett has connections, he had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.""Schmidt said that the brothers have evidence to back up their claims.""That's why when they went from persons of interest to suspects, they are free men and they are at home,"" she said.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.Last week, a Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment against Smollett.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on ""Empire"" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors said Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the ""Empire"" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary.""Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:"

A grand jury in Chicago has indicted ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted racial and homophobic slurs.

The Cook County grand jury indictment filed Thursday charges him with falsely reporting an offense.

Smollett was charged on Feb. 20 with one count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

“Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment said, according to CBS 2 Chicago.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police in late January that he was attacked by two men in downtown Chicago who wrapped a rope around his neck.

Police say Smollett recruited two men to stage the attack because he was upset with his pay on the Fox show. Smollett has denied playing a role in the attack.

Irv Miller, a legal analyst at CBS 2, said Smollett could face probation to up to three years in prison if convicted.

“[The grand jury] decided he told multiple lies,” Miller said, according to the outlet. “There were going to charge him for each.”

“If you have a crime, and that crime has multiple parts to it, you charge all those separate parts.”

Meanwhile, Chicago police say they are conducting an internal investigation to determine the source of information leaked anonymously to media during the probe into Smollett's claims.

Smollett is set to be arraigned March 14, CBS 2 reports.

Netflix hit The Crown is said to have started casting for Princess Diana in season four.

The show is looking for a ‘mesmerising new star’ to play the late princess aged 18-22 in a role that is set to ‘ruffle a few feathers’.

Season four will see a young Diana struggle to adjust to life as a royal.

The casting ad, seen by The Sun, reportedly calls for a ‘staggeringly talented young actress…with extraordinary range’.

‘She has to play charming comedy, flirt and social exhibitionist on the world stage, desperate and lonely self-harmer at her lowest ebb and the kind of psychological intensity of Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby,’ it reads.

A source added that creator Peter Morgan ‘is not going to hold back on how Diana impacted the Royal Family, just as he didn’t when he wrote The Queen. It could ruffle a few feathers.’

Rosemary’s Baby, released in 1968, follows a young mum who believes she is pregnant with the Devil’s child.

Princess Diana died in a car accident in 1997 at 31-years-old.

The Crown season three stars Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II, taking over the role from Claire Foy in seasons one and two. She is joined by Helena Bonham-Carter as her sister Princess Margaret.

Colman will play the role for two seasons before the cast changes again to accurately portray the royals when they are older.

In the new series, the Queen’s life with Prince Charles will move even further into the public eye.

Her relationship with then Prime Minister Harold Wilson will also be at the centre of the story. One episode will include the Apollo 11 moon landing, and Prince Philip’s reaction to it, while others will feature the decolonisation of Africa and the Carribean and the birth of Prince Edward.

Prince Philip, played by Matt Smith in seasons one and two, will be played by Tobias Menzies.

The Crown season three will air on Netflix later this year

Jussie Smollett paid the brothers accused of helping him stage a hate crime $3500 (£2,600) for a nutrition and fitness program, or so says the cheque which has been released.

However, Ola and Abel Osundairo’s attorney, Gloria Schmidt, appeared on Good Morning America on Monday and claimed that although the brothers were helping Jussie to get fit for an upcoming music video, the payment was also a ‘favour to stage the attack’.

‘They were training together so they were paid for that, but they were also asked to do this favour for them, unbeknownst to them, as it turned out to be a big betrayal for them,’ she said.

Sorry, this video isn't available any more.

‘It would be such an easy narrative to see it that way, but it’s unfortunately a complicated relationship,’ she added when asked if the payment was purely for the training and not the attack.

‘If you’re friends and you’re saying “hey I want to pay you for training but I am also asking you to do me a favour”… and the favour was to stage the attack.’

She later clarified her comments in a statement and said that ‘to say the check for $3,500 was just for the incident is not a full representation of what transpired’.

‘My clients had an agreement to provide personal training services to Mr. Smollett. To say the check (sic) was also intended for a favor beyond the training is an accurate statement.’

Jussie found fame on Empire (Picture: Fox)

Jussie was allegedly attacked by two masked men in Chicago, with reports stating his attackers had ‘beaten him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him’.

The actor received treatment following the attack and had reported the incident to Chicago Police, with the authorities treating it as a ‘hate crime’ after his attackers allegedly hurled racist and homophobic slurs at Jussie throughout.

However, after the two men arrested over the attack were released, Jussie was arrested.

The 36-year-old Empire actor was originally charged with one Class 4 Felony charge for disorderly conduct for filing a false report but in a 86-page indictment (via CWB Chicago), that charge has now been applied 15 times over by Cook County grand jury, meaning he now faces 16 felony counts.

While each charge doesn’t potentially mean additional time in prison, each charge does carry a maximum probation sentence of four years; he’s now potentially facing a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation.

Jussie has denied all the allegations against him and is set to appear in court on 16 March.

Wade Robson has been targeted by a number of fraud Twitter accounts, following Leaving Neverland airing in the UK and the US.

Robson appears alongside James Safechuck in the HBO documentary and both accuse Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them when they were children.

Leaving Neverland interviews both men and their families and left viewers ‘disturbed and uncomfortable’ after exploring their claims in graphic detail.

Michael Jackson fans have shown their support for the singer and branded the documentary ‘one-sided’. Both the singer’s estate and his family have said the claims shown in Leaving Neverland are ‘not true’ and accused Robson and Safechuck of ‘trying to make money’ from Jackson.

TMZ reports that Robson has now had fake Twitter accounts made in his name, with one account (@WadeRCreations) prompting an angry response from Aaron Carter.

The account responded to another user calling Wade a ‘liar’ and posing as him tweeted back: ‘I’m not alone, you ask @aaroncarter.’

It has now been removed – Robson’s lawyer said the accounts are posing as the choreographer and are fake.

Aaron was understandably not happy to have his name dragged into the conversation. The I Want Candy singer was friends with Michael when he was a teenager and has remained supportive to the late star.

He tweeted: ‘WADE ROBSON DONT DRAG MY NAME INTO SHIT!!! YOU DONT WANT THIS KEEP MY NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH YOU STARTED THIS SHIT.’

Speaking to TMZ, Aaron said he ‘idolised Michael’, who would give him advice back when he was 15 years old.

He accused Robson of ‘stomping on an icon and a legend’s grave’ by taking part in Leaving Neverland, after seeing the tweets allegedly posted by Wade.

Aaron said he was ‘disappointed’ in Robson, telling the publication: ‘You’re trying to tie my name into this shit? At Aaron Carter? I’m not that guy… you’re lucky I’ve got something to lose now.

‘I would punch you in the face. Maybe I’d ask you if you’re telling the truth, but I’d punch you in the face first.’

He said he couldn’t understand Robson’s claims against MJ, adding: ‘How am I supposed to understand that when my own experience of him was gentle and beautiful and loving?’

Robson’s lawyer responded to Aaron’s comments and told TMZ that the tweet taking aim at him was ‘not posted by Wade’.

They claim Robson has been targeted by ‘several fraudulent postings and hackings’ since Leaving Neverland was broadcast on TV.

Thank goodness for Solange. As February came to a close, the artist unveiled a hard-fought album and film that highlights how black people create various home spaces for respite and revival.

The Grammy Award-winning artist’s latest project, “When I Get Home,” serves in large part as a personal homage to her Houston, Texas roots and the city’s cultural artifacts. But one of the album’s strongest themes extends beyond Houston: How black Americans carve out collective safe spaces, whether manifested physically, spiritually, mentally or communally.

In many ways, Solange’s “Home” acts as a reclamation. Black Americans navigate a predominantly white society — one that’s often made the idea of having a home at all feel elusive or impossible. Indeed, throughout February, we were reminded of the many ways a mainstream white society continues to persecute, deny and minimize our experience.

Black Americans navigate a predominantly white society — one that’s often made the idea of having a home at all feel elusive or impossible.

To name a few examples, the governor of Virginia — the nation’s first slave colony 400 years ago —became one of several politicians who admitted to wearing blackface in the past, and in the process incorrectly referring to enslaved people as “indentured servants.” The film “Green Book,” which purportedly chronicled Dr. Don Shirley traversing the Jim Crow south while on tour, took the Oscar for Best Picture despite being panned by critics and his living family members as a white savior narrative that featured a “symphony of lies.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested rapper 21 Savage in a “targeted operation” days after the artist released a music video with lyrics critiquing the nation’s immigration policies. The rapper’s arrest, allegedly for overstaying his visa, prompted a barrage of memes that made light of the situation. Meanwhile, actor Liam Neeson revealed that power-walking helped quell his racist revenge murder fantasies. Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime hoax sparked new doubts about the veracity of the other real incidents. A black sixth-grader in Florida was arrested after the student opted out of the Pledge of Allegiance.

And of noteworthy coincidence, on Feb. 28, the day Solange announced the surprise release of “When I Get Home,” the Washington Post outlined the way racism and government policy rollbacks have resulted in a “heartbreaking” decrease in black homeownership.

So there’s something special about how “When I Get Home” openly claims and celebrates the sonic blackness of her Houston hometown, an area increasingly vulnerable to gentrification and the displacement of black residents following Hurricane Harvey.

The influence of the historically black Third Ward, where Solange grew up, can be felt throughout the album. This is also the area Solange returned to in search of “exploration of origin,” as she shared in conversation on March 3 with artist and curator Antwaun Sargent. (The album film was screened live in multiple Third Ward locations.)

From black cowboys and rolls down the street in slab cars with booming bass stereos to lyrics about a kickback lubricated by brown liquor and unapologetic blackness, “When I Get Home” gathers together many distinct feelings, experiences and sounds of blackness. It reclaims a sense of place among many elements that may seem fragmented and scattered, yet can still be reunited and made whole both individually and collectively.

“[B]lackness will never go away. It’s who I am. It's what I know. I’ll always be a black woman, I’ll always create work from this black woman's body,” Solange said during the conversation with Antwaun Sargent. “I’ll always be from Third Ward, where we had one of the first black banks in the country… where I spent summer camp learning about all of the incredible things that you see in this place, where I got to go to a black woman’s hair salon every day and hear the stories of women. This is just who I am.”

The concept of reunification — returning to the people, places and things that recall a sense of home — is one that historically resonates with black people.

The concept of reunification — returning to the people, places and things that recall a sense of home — is one that historically resonates with black people. Black family reunions are rooted in tragedy; slavery ripped families apart and the Great Migration spread family members across the country in hopes of a better life. Oftentimes, the reunions take place in the south, and family members come from all over the country to meet, some for the first time, and break bread together. There’s a reason Negro spirituals often reference “going home” to heaven as an escape from the troubles of the world.

In 2019, home spaces for black people aren’t limited to physical spaces, however — they also extend online, including communities like Black Twitter and its social media forebears like Black Planet. (Solange tellingly chose to promote “When I Get Home” on Black Planet.) Before Facebook and other platforms shot up in popularity, Black Planet rivaled the likes of MySpace, gathering millions of black people in an online community. Solange’s return to that space — that home — thus functioned as an online family reunion.

Amber Heard says her parents struggled to accept her sexuality when she first came out to them.

The 32-year-old actress has openly spoke about being bisexual – publicly coming out in 2010 – and has had relationships with both men and women play out in the public eye.

Speaking at the Making Change On and Off the Screen panel at SXSW, Amber revealed her parents were in ‘tears’ when she first opened up to them about her sexuality.

She said: ‘I was raised in a religious home. Being an outspoken lesbian, atheist, vegetarian, I remember when I told them about my relationship – that I was in love with this woman – and at the beginning of that, it was just tears… tears.’

‘They didn’t know how to process it because, for them, it was being thrown into a binary system of processing it,’ she said. ‘[It was either] negative or positive.’

Heard explained that five years later her parents’ ‘attitude and heart’ towards her sexuality changed.

‘Five years later, I was getting an award. I asked my parents to drive out to Dallas and I see them sitting front and centre and here I am getting this “gay” award.

‘Look at the journey. Attitudes and hearts can change.’

Amber was previously in a relationship with ex-girlfriend Tasya van Ree for four years. They split in 2012 and three years later, she married ex-husband Johnny Depp.

Heard filed for divorce in 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp five days after, alleging that the Hollywood star had been verbally and physically abusive towards her.

Amber and Johnny came to a settlement and the restraining order was dismissed.

But the Pirates of the Caribbean star has now filed a $50million (£37.8m) defamation lawsuit against Heard over an op ed piece she had written for the Washington Post about domestic abuse in December 2018.

Depp wasn’t specifically mentioned in the Washington Post piece, but the actor’s legal team claimed the article’s implication was that Depp ‘perpetrated domestic violence against her’ – allegations he ‘categorically’ denies.

Heard’s lawyer responded to Depp’s legal action with a statement that read: ‘This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. She will not be silenced.

‘Mr. Depp’s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behaviour.

‘But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self-destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.’

(Chicago Police Department/TNS)

The lawyer for the brothers connected with the Jussie Smollett case says her clients were “taken advantage” of by the “Empire” actor — and that there’s evidence to prove they’re telling the truth.

Gloria Schmidt, who represents Ola and Abel Osundairo, contended that the two men were betrayed by Smollett, who police say paid the brothers to carry out a staged attack on him in January.

“I really look at the dynamic between loyalty and someone who was in a position of trust with my clients who really just took advantage of them,” Schmidt said Monday on “Good Morning America.”

“They worked with Jussie,” she continued. “They’ve known him. They were friends with him. This was someone who the brothers thought could help their career. Obviously, Mr. Smollett had connections. He had a good position with Fox, so this was someone that they had trusted to consider their best interests.”

Smollett was arrested last month for allegedly orchestrating the attack. He was indicted on 16 counts by a grand jury last week.

Schmidt said Monday that Smollett gave the brothers $3,500 for a personal training program, but said it would be an “easy narrative” to say the actor only paid for the training.

“It’s unfortunately a very complicated relationship for them, because if you’re friends, and I’m saying, ‘Hey, I’m going to pay you for training, I’m also asking you to do me a favor,’ “ she told host George Stephanopoulos.

She went on to say that the “favor” was to stage the attack.

Smollett’s legal team has maintained his innocence.

Smollett, 36, claimed to police in January that he had been attacked in Chicago by two people who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and placed a rope around his neck.

Following his arrest last month, the Chicago Police Department’s superintendent, Eddie Johnson, asserted the actor staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.”

Fox removed him from the final two episodes of Season 5 of “Empire” following his arrest."

In most cases, Fox has renewed “Empire” in January for the following season.

The cast and crew of Empire are reportedly concerned over the future of the show, as it still hasn’t been renewed by Fox.

Empire has been making headlines in recent months, thanks to the ongoing investigation into Jussie Smollett – who plays Jamal Lyon in the series – being attacked in Chicago at the end of January.

Jussie was attacked by two masked men and the incident was initially treated as a hate crime by authorities, as he claimed he suffered racial and homophobic abuse during the ordeal.

Two men were questioned and released over the attack and Jussie was later charged and arrested for filing a false police report. He has been accused of ‘orchestrating’ the attack – allegations he has continuously denied.

He was released after posting bail, but is now facing 16 charges, including one Class 4 felony charge for disorderly conduct.

TMZ reports that Empire cast and crew are now growing concerned over the show’s future amid the ongoing case involving in Jussie – especially as the show is yet to be picked up for a sixth season.

A source claims to the publication that ‘anxiety is high’ among the cast and crew, as they expected to hear news of the show being renewed by now.

The insider added that cast and crew feel Jussie’s case will be ‘a big factor’ in whether or not the show gets picked up again and there are ‘serious reservations’ about having the actor return.

Metro.co.uk have reached out to a rep for Jussie.

Show bosses have already confirmed that Jussie’s character Jamal has been pulled from the final two episodes of season five.

In previous years, Fox has renewed Empire in January – usually five months ahead of the current season airing’s finale.

Last year had been an exception, though, with confirmation Empire had been renewed not coming until season four ended in May.

Jussie is potentially facing a maximum of three years in prison, a $25,000 fine and 60 years probation, following the new charges made against him.

Jussie’s attorney, Mark Geragos, issued a statement to People magazine that claimed the new charges are a ‘prosecutorial overkill’.

He stressed that Jussie is still ‘maintaining his innocence’ and continues to deny the charges against him, after he was indicted by a grand jury on Friday.

The statement read: ‘The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination.

‘What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie.’

It continued: ‘This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records.

‘Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.’

An attorney for Ola and Abel Osundairo said they feel “betrayed” by the actor and are trying “to pick up the pieces of what this has done to their lives.”

“This entire thing started because they put their trust in the wrong person,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said in an interview on CBSN.

Chicago police claim Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to stage a hate crime against him in late January because he was upset with his salary on Empire. But according to a new TMZ report, the brothers insist the $3500 check was payment for training and diet regimen designed to get Smollett in shape for a music video shoot.

On Friday, a Chicago grand jury hit the singer with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for fabricating the alleged Jan. 29 attack during which he claims two masked white males beat him up and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him and doused him with bleach.

After a three week investigation, police concluded that Smollett actually conspired with the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack.

“They feel tremendously regretful for their role in this, and their involvement in the situation,” Schmidt said. “The impact that this has had – not only on them, but on minority populations – that weighs very heavily on them.”

According to Schmidt, the brothers are hoping to “make this something positive for them and have a positive impact on the community.”

Schmidt insists her clients did not commit a hate crime but they certainly feel betrayed by the entertainer.

“They felt that their friend, someone who had helped them get some connections, would not put them in a situation where they’re now being labeled as someone who would commit a hate crime,” she said. “I can tell you, with confidence, they did not commit a hate crime. They also did not know that their loyalty to him would be betrayed.”

The brothers are not expecting special treatment from prosecutors in exchange for their grand jury testimony against Smollett.

“They fully cooperated with the police. They’re still cooperating with the police. They have not sought out any kind of immunity or any kind of plea deals. That is not on the table. They are not interested in that. They just wanted to come out and cooperate and tell the truth,” she said.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, wonders why the Osundairo brothers were not indicted right along with his client.

“I haven’t seen one piece of evidence, and they don’t have one piece of evidence that they’ve turned over that links Jussie to this. What they do have is a whale of a case. If you believe what the police chief is saying, they’ve got a great case against the two brothers,” Geragos said. “What do they have that corroborates this story? These are the two people Juthat did it. What do they have besides their word that says he was in on this?”"
