The attack was caught on video.

UC Berkeley campus police arrested Greenberg on Friday. He bonded out of jail and his arraignment is set for Wednesday. CNN has reached out to Greenberg's representatives for comment.

The attack occurred at Sproul Plaza on February 19, officials said. Turning Point USA identified the alleged victim to CNN as Hayden Williams, who had been invited to UC Berkeley to help recruit students for a yet-to-be-formed chapter on campus.

Deputy District Attorney Rebecca Warren filed the charges against Greenberg. They include felony assault, felony battery, felony criminal threats and a misdemeanor vandalism charge. The criminal threats charge says it is a ""serious felony"" and further alleges ""that the threatened crime, on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made, was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey to Hayden Williams a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution.""

Before the charges were filed, a media representative for Williams said he is a field representative for the Leadership Institute, an organization that helps train conservative leaders. Williams is not a UC Berkeley student, the representative said.

The noted journalist said the sit-down with the Empire actor who alleged he suffered from a homophobic and racist hate crime weeks prior “was one of the most challenging interviews” she’s ever had to do, reports Page Six.

“I’m a Black gay woman, he’s a Black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother.’ If I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.’ It was a no-win situation for me.”

Roberts said she was initially hesitant to interview Smollett.

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,'” she said. “And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.’”

She added: “They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.’”

The interview took place on Feb. 12 and aired two days later. By then, however, then-unconfirmed leaks from the Chicago police department had introduced the idea that the brothers who who’d been detained said the actor paid them to stage the attack.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?'” Roberts said. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,” she said.

Smollett turned himself in to police after he was charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He posted bond, and his next court date is March 14. He has maintained his innocence though hasn’t released a statement.

Strokes are marked by a burst blood vessel in the brain that cuts off its oxygen supply, often with devastating results. Tragically, they’re also common: The American Heart Association reports there are about 795,000 cases per year, some 140,000 of them fatal. While most strokes afflict those aged 60 and above, nearly 10 percent occur in people under 45.

“Young people should realize that stroke is not only a disease of the elderly — it can affect anyone of any age,” says Dr. Jose Torres, neurologist at NYU Langone’s Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases.

Strokes among adults between 18 and 45 have increased by more than 50 percent since Perry’s mid-1990s heyday. Unfortunately, it’s this same age group that most often ignores the warning signs.

While there’s no reliable way to predict their onset, risk factors for strokes in younger adults are often associated with a genetic predisposition, such as a congenital heart condition, where clot formation is a risk.

High blood pressure is one of the “biggest risk factor[s],” so keeping those levels under control is crucial, Torres says. “Diseases that can lead to heart attack” — high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol — “are all intertwined with stroke risk.”

Unhealthy habits such as smoking can exacerbate these conditions, while cocaine can cause blood vessels in the brain to spasm, leading to an elevated blood pressure that can cause a hemorrhage.

Early detection can mean the difference between life and death.

“Timing is key,” says Torres, adding that “about two million neurons are damaged every minute that a part of the brain is undergoing a stroke.”

He and other physicians tell patients to remember the acronym B.E.F.A.S.T.: Balance loss, eye (vision) issues, face drooping, arm weakness and speech difficulty. “T” means “time to call 9-1-1.”

“There’s a lot we can do for patients if they get to us quickly,” says Torres. “The sooner they come in, the better they do overall.”"

Williams is a LI field organizer and he was trying to get more recruits for Turning Points USA. Apparently, this was very triggering for some because he was punched in the face for it. Students and some faculty of the school voiced their support for this act of violence because that’s the Left; words almost always fail them. It’s typical Berkeley. It’s how progressives deal with people who have a differing opinion. An investigation was launched, but for days he eluded capture. On February 25, Williams appeared on Fox News’ Hannity to detail his assault (via Free Beacon):

[WARNING: Graphic language]





Still sporting a black eye, Williams told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday that some people walking by took offense to the table's sign, ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" a reference to the Jussie Smollett case. According to him, two men approached him in what he described as an erratic fashion, accusing him of promoting racism and violence, and one of them ""took his aggression out on us."" He said he started recording the men out of fear for his safety. At one point, his phone was slapped out of his hand. […] A man in a black shirt swore, flipped over his table, and then repeatedly cursed at him, threatening to shoot him at one point and calling him a ""c—t,"" ""motherf—er,"" and ""racist, little inbred bitch."" A bystander's video showed him tussling with Williams and finally sucker-punching him in the eye, walking away yelling, ""f—ing c–t!"" Police do not believe the suspect is a student at the university.

On March 1, authorities identified the punk and booked him into jail (via CBS San Francisco):

A man being sought for the assault of a conservative activist on the University of California, Berkeley campus last month has been arrested. A statement from UC Berkeley Public Affairs said a warrant was issued for suspect Zachary Greenberg and UC police arrested him Friday, booking him into jail at 1 p.m. […] The incident was recorded by two Cal students with cellphones and video of the encounter has since gone viral. Police will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges, the university said.

Since then, there have been many twists in the actor’s case, including his felony disorderly conduct arrest for allegedly filing a false police report. Two Nigerian-American brothers have come forward to say they were paid to stage the attack, but the money they were paid was reportedly for training. To9 confuse matters even more, the FBI has said the Chicago Police Department “overstated” their case against Smollett.

Now, Robin Roberts is speaking out about her interview with the “Empire” star, according to Page Six.

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” Roberts said Monday during an interview. “I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up.’ And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

She continued, “They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview.’ I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say.”

Roberts said she was trying to be neutral, but “I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man. He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass. It was a no-win situation for me.”

She ended by saying, “It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do.”

Two days after Roberts interviewed Smollett, the Nigerian brothers came forward, changing the trajectory of the investigation.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

The 36-year-old actor and singer made it clear that he was not lying, telling Roberts, “For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing. I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

Smollett also said he was optimistic when he was told there was a camera where the alleged attack took place. However, the camera was in the opposite direction. Smollett also had another theory on why people were doubting him.

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he said. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more.. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.” Watch below:

Now anger has turned on her husband and stepdaughter whom police accused of being the actual killers.

Texas authorities charged Keith Smith, 52, and his 28-year-old daughter Valeria Smith on Monday with the first-degree murder of Smith’s wife, Jacquelyn Smith, WBAL-TV reported. Baltimore police investigators were expected to interview the father and daughter suspects on Tuesday when an extradition hearing was also scheduled.

Jacquelyn Smith, 54, an electrical engineer at Aberdeen Proving Ground, was stabbed to death at about 12:30 a.m. on Dec. 1, the Baltimore Sun reported. Smith’s husband blamed the stabbing on a man who approached their car to beg for money.

“The information and evidence points to it wasn’t a panhandler,” Acting Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said Sunday at a press conference, pointing the finger of guilt to Keith Smith.

Arrest warrants for Keith Smith and Valeria Smith listed murder, conspiracy, assault and weapons charges. The arrest warrant for Valeria Smith named her as an accessory after the fact in the killing of Jacquelyn Smith by husband Keith Smith.

“To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy,” Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said in a tweet Sunday.

The developments came against the backdrop of the Chicago Police Department accusing actor Jussie Smollett of staging a racist and homophobic attack in December. News of the alleged assault in Chicago elicited outrage against two presumed white men, as well as an outpouring of sympathy for the “Empire” star. Chicago’s notoriously corrupt police were also accused of exaggerating the evidence against Smollett.

The Baltimore police stated that Keith Smith called 911 on Dec. 1 to report that his wife had stopped her car to hand money to a needy woman with a baby when a man approached, according to CNN. Smith said the man tried to grab his wife’s wallet, fatally stabbed her in a struggle and fled with the woman and baby. Investigators searched without success for the alleged killer, described as a man in his 30s with a goatee.

But residents of the neighborhood where the alleged killing happened expressed immediate doubts about the story, according to the Sun. None of the people interviewed ever recalled seeing a woman with a baby or a man panhandling in the neighborhood.

Adding to the reported doubt, Keith Smith has a criminal past. He was arrested in 2000 for bank robberies, WBAL-TV reporter Jayne Miller tweeted.

“I already know it’s Keith,” Jacquelyn Smith’s brother Marcel Trisvan told the Sun about who committed the killing. “All the questioning has been specific to Keith. That kind of sums it right there. It never made sense. I told [detectives] from the very beginning there are no suspects out there.”

Texas troopers caught Smith and his daughter while they were reportedly trying to escape to Mexico. About 10 a.m. Sunday, a trooper spotted their rental car leaving the parking lot of a small grocery store near the border. They were taken into custody without incident.

“Media Matters still arguing that the Smollett attack was not a hoax, and they of course are ‘Newsguard certified’ green check mark,” Trump Jr. declared. “That’s the problem with leftists policing ‘the news’. Newsguard Certified means nothing… if anything it probably means inivetable [sic] bias.”

As noted by Trump, NewsGuard does give the story its green seal of approval as “real news.”

NewsGuard, which purports to separate real news from fake news and which, unlike most plug-ins, is included in Microsoft’s mobile Edge browser by default only requiring user activation, rated many articles which took actor Jussie Smollett’s hate crime hoax at face value, and blamed Trump supporters, as credible news.

A story published by GQ, titled, “The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America’s Endgame,” was given the all-clear by NewsGuard, which claimed GQ “generally maintains basic standards of credibility and transparency.”

NewsGuard also claimed GQ, “Does not repeatedly publish false content,” “Gathers and presents information responsibly,” “Handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly,” and most ironically, “Avoids deceptive headlines.”

GQ has since changed the title of the article to “The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is America’s Endgame,” and included a small disclaimer noting that the “hate crime” was a hoax.

Left-wing website Salon was given a green rating from NewsGuard on one of its stories which claimed that questioning whether Smollett’s now-debunked “hate crime” attack actually happened was “hate-crime denial,” despite the red flags, and a Vanity Fair article which claimed without skepticism that Smollett had been “the victim of a racist, homophobic attack,” was also given a green rating from NewsGuard.

An article on AlterNet which called out conservatives for claiming the alleged “hate crime” was a hoax was also rated as credible by NewsGuard.

AlterNet has a green rating from NewsGuard, despite the plugin admitting that the website fails to handle “the difference between news and opinion responsibly.”

It is not the first time that NewsGuard has deemed articles about hoaxes to be credible.

As reported by Breitbart News’ John Nolte, NewsGuard gave its “seal of approval” for “Rolling Stone’s 2014 hoax about a gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA).”

“Rolling Stone (which NewsGuard gave a passing grade) was eventually forced to retract the story and settle some lawsuits, but the far-left HuffPost’s aggregation of Rolling Stone’s proven lie is still live, and that green checkmark is NewsGuard’s way of telling readers they are reading something credible,” Nolte explained.

Breitbart News, WikiLeaks, the Drudge Report, and many other websites and news outlets are currently on NewsGuard’s media blacklist, while BuzzFeed, CNN, the New York Times, NPR, and Reuters are all rated as trustworthy by NewsGuard, despite them having a history of publishing fake, or misleading news.

As previously reported, “NewsGuard’s advisory board is mostly made up of alumni from the presidential administrations of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, and many of the members have previously spread inaccurate information, promoted conspiracy theories, and engaged in unethical journalism.”"

Like a Jewish edition of the murder mystery game Clue, John Mulaney was on Saturday Night Live, playing Alan Dershowitz, giving legal advice to Robert Kraft.

In a sketch patterned on the ABC reality investment show “Shark Tank,” comedian Mulaney (Jewish in our hearts) played lawyer Alan Dershowitz, offering his possible services as a legal counsel to billionaire New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was recently and charged for soliciting prostitution.

The sketch also featured Jew-ish SNL comedian Pete Davidson (as Michael Avenatti,) and SNL’s Chris Redd as the disgraced Jew-ish actor Jussie Smollett. Let this be a friendly reminder from the Schmooze that it is always, always a good time to invest in Jewish pop culture figures.

The mostly painful sketch features Dershowitz and Avenatti on a panel alongside Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon). The ever-endearing Mulaney took on Dershowitz’s claim of social ostracism by the denizens of Martha’s Vineyard, and skewered the former Harvard professor’s ubiquity in high-profile cases. Mulaney, as Dershowitz, said, “Jussie, you’ve got everything I love in a client — you’re famous, you’re probably guilty — end of list.”

The sketch danced around the fact that Kraft, who was arrested for soliciting a prostitution, was brought down in a sex trafficking sting. “I’m also the only person ever to take a private jet straight to a $59 hand job,” said Beck Bennett, as Kraft — police say “services” at the spa where Kraft was apparently a “regular” cost as little as $59 for half an hour.

“Let the man have his fun,” the Dershowitz character responded. “Also, $59 in Palm Beach! I respect a man for getting a great deal.”

Dershowitz’s career is long, and he’s known for many things — pinching pennies is not one of them. It’s hard to see this line as anything other than anti-Semitic stereotyping, not to mention lazy joke writing.

Cecily Strong rescued the sketch with her hyper-realistic spoof of Judge Jeanine Pirro, shouting, of Jussie Smollett, “A gay, black man lying about an attack! I wrote Fox News fanfiction about this, but I never thought it would come true.”

Washington Post

On January 19, 2019 the Washington Post published an on-line account of what was purported to be a straight forward news feature about a public disturbance that occurred at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, on January 18 involving High School students waiting on a bus to take them back to their Catholic High School in Covington Kentucky. It was not a news story! It was an intentional public political assassination of innocents by a newspaper with world wide reach! It was known deceptive propaganda, just like Jussie Smollet’s drama in Chicago! With the revered Lincoln Memorial as a back drop the Washington Post proceeded to fabricate their report! It was particularly directed at a white eleventh grader, Nicholas Sandman, wearing a red MAGA hat!

What attracted the Washington Post at all? It was red MAGA hats! The scent of blood permeated the anti-American socialist newsroom like mammal blood in the water attracts sharks! The incident became a swarming blind feeding frenzy of made up fake “news” reporting! Millions could read about it worldwide and hate those arrogant anti-abortion, Trump supporting, white mocking Christian Catholic teenagers from the South! It was perfect for the Washington Post in their blind hatred of President Donald Trump and any who support him! Like Jussie Smollett the Washington Post carefully choreographed the whole thing even film editing and splicing to present their intentionally deceiving narrative! Like Jussie it was a self created fake news media firestorm! The Washington Post had in this one incident all they hate: (a) Conservatives (b) White People and Trump supporters (c) independent thinking teenagers (c) many MAGA hats. (d) Christians via a Catholic High School (e) arrogant white teenagers from the bigoted South; and, (f) Disgusting supporters of the right of pre born babies to live! It was perfect!

They also had all they revered and loved: (a) Like Elizabeth Warren there were marginalized Native American Indians-the leader was a Vietnam War Combatant being disrespected just like Elizabeth, Nathan Phillips! Whatever claimed injustices from 100 years ago, and now, were to be suffered by these white students and Trump supporters! The arrogant white teenagers did not bow as they should have in the presence of adults and a Native American Indian Vietnam War combatant hero! (b) There were revered blacks, Black Hebrew Israelites, who precipitated the encounter and actually shouting insulting taunts at the students. Whatever injustices were claimed by them from 100 years ago, and now, were to be paid for by these Trump supporting white Christian students! The students did not bow and yield to those adults as the Washington Post would have them do!

Tapes show the Native American Indian group actually initially instigated the face-off by advancing into the students-not the other way around (tapes show they advanced on the students) but were given a pass by the Washington Post along with the guilty Black Hebrew Israelite group (they initially instigated the taunts); but, the innocent white group defending themselves from these attacks were found guilty by the Washington Post!

You can always expect this political agenda from fake news! Hardly a week passed before the fake news story was blown out of the water! But the Washington Post did little to correct its errors until an editorial note on March 1, 2019 listing some of its errors in initial reporting! That was about 40 days after the original publication and probably would not have been mentioned again it all except they got sued! They would have left the lie to stand. It was, after all, an excellent political hacking for all to read in the future and be filled with hate!

The Washington Post now admits-after being sued-(a) that it was the student group being taunted after initially reporting the student group was the initial taunting group (b) that Nathan Phillips, the American Indian, was not barred in any way after initially reporting the students had caused him fear by blocking his retreat (c) That Nathan Phillips, the Native American Indian, was not a war combat Vietnam veteran after initially reporting he was (d) that the students did not initiate the conflict after initially reporting they did.

It also turns out Nathan Phillips has a long history of agitation as do the Black Hebrew Israelite group. Also the “wall” taunts, and other supposed taunts reported by Phillips and CNN from the student group are on not on the tapes but the taunts of the black group are!

The whole narrative presented by the Washington Post originally was a lie!! But for millions who may never read about corrections it will always be the lie created by the Washington Post and other fake news outlets most people will hold in their memory! That is what fake news does best-lie to present their political agenda as news! They learn nothing from their deceiving firestorms except to do it again with Jussie Smollett! If you see anything from ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post or the New York Times, the Democratic Party, Hollywood or the Entertainment and Sports Industry about politics, Conservatives or Christians you can be assured it contains little truth and is primarily motivated by hatred of Christians and Conservatives, especially white Christian Conservatives or anyone who supports Donald Trump! It is also a direct attack on Christian social views about abortion or homo sexuality! There are other issues but these are presently in the lime light! This particular Christian Conservative supports Donald Trump for his presently revealed secular earthly conservative policies. I may disagree with future policies! I may otherwise disagree with him about Jesus Christ as I do not know his views on Jesus Christ! Society needs Donald Trump’s earthly policies to exist in this world with order. All humanity needs Jesus Christ, and Him alone, to exist in God’s heavenly world."

“I’ll be completely honest, I was like I don’t know if I want to do the interview or not,” she said during The Cut’s “How I Get It Done” event at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge on Monday.

“I said, ‘I don’t want to sit down with him if he’s going to lawyer up,'” the “Good Morning America” host, 58, recalled. “And then I was told, ‘He wants to speak with you,’ [because] he was outraged by people making assumptions about whether it had happened or not.”

Roberts said she was promised she could challenge him on the “red flags” over the alleged racist and homophobic attack and that she’d get new information out of him.

“They said, ‘He wants to say things that he has not said’ and I’m like, ‘As a journalist, as a newsperson, this is newsworthy, he’s going to go on record for the first time, yes I’ll do the interview,'” she explained.

Following the interview, ABC staffers have said they were skeptical of Smollett’s story.

Scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 12, the interview started two-and-a-half hours later than expected.

“I sit down with him, and I don’t know what he’s going to say,” she said. “Following up [about how] he couldn’t believe people didn’t believe him, well I go, ‘You’re out 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re getting a sandwich, [and] you won’t give up your phone.'”

But trying to be as “neutral” as possible, Roberts acknowledged the inherent pressure she felt to represent the LGBT community.

“I’m a black gay woman, he’s a black gay man,” she said. “He’s saying that there’s a hate crime, so if I’m too hard, then my LGBT community is going to say, ‘You don’t believe a brother,’ if I’m too light on him, it’s like, ‘Oh, because you are in the community, you’re giving him a pass.'”

“It was a no-win situation for me,” she explained.

Two days later, when the interview aired, the discussion was overshadowed by news that two Nigerian brothers alleged they were paid by the actor to stage the attack.

“People are looking at the interview through the eyes of ‘How did you not know?'” she recalled. “I did the interview 48 hours before then. Had I had that information or [knew] what the brothers were alleging, heck yeah, I would have asked him about that.”

“I pride myself in being fair, I know how much work went into being balanced about what had happened and to challenge him on certain things,” she said.

She concluded by saying that since Smollett was considered a victim at the time of their interview, she carefully selected her questions.

“There’s so many people who do not come forward because others are not believed. I don’t know how this is all going to end,” she said. “We still talk to the [Chicago] police superintendent [Eddie T. Johnson].”

“It was one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever had to do,” she said.

Smollett turned himself in to police just a week after the brothers came forward saying that the attack was orchestrated. He is facing disorderly conduct charges for filing a false police report. He is now out on bond, and his next court date is March 14."

Gladnick', 'Contributing Writer']",https://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/cohen1.jpg,"['steele', 'cohen', 'times', 'dossier', 'cohens', 'douthat', 'columnist', 'testimony', 'intelligence', 'trump', 'ross', 'york', 'russian', 'turn', 'discredits', 'claims', 'trumps']","""Conservative"" columnist Ross Douthat of the New York Times sounded like he was committing editorial-page heresy on Saturday for claiming that Michael Cohen's testimony before Congress last week cast doubt upon the validity of the Christopher Steele dossier which has been the main pillar of the quickly dissipating Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory.

It seems that Douthat is all alone at the Times for daring to explore the notion that Team Trump might not be evil geniuses in league with Putin just how weak the Steele dossier is based on Cohen's testimony in ""The State of Russiagate."" They may have been hapless bumblers.

In the window of calm between Michael Cohen’s testimony and the allegedly almost-at-hand delivery of Robert Mueller’s report, it’s worth returning for a moment to the document that established the darkest interpretation of all the Russian weirdness swirling around Donald Trump: the intelligence dossier created by Christopher Steele, late of MI6, on behalf of Trump’s political opponents, which brought together the reports and rumors that Steele deemed credible about the then-candidate, now-president’s Russia ties. ...While retaining an official agnosticism, my sense after Cohen’s testimony is that the odds are as low as they’ve been since this whole affair started, and the increasing likelihood is that the Steele dossier was, in fact, as Trump’s defenders have long described it — a narrative primarily grounded in Russian disinformation. That’s because Cohen’s testimony dovetailed with the always-more-plausible narrative in which Trump and his circle weren’t collaborators but fools and wannabes, who might have been willing to play games with spies and hackers, but who mostly just bumbled around haplessly on the sidelines.

Hmmm......siding with Trump's defenders? Could that paragraph be incorporated into Douthat's auto da fé termination ceremony at the Times?

Meanwhile on every other Russia-related front, Cohen — with every reason to knife his former boss — offered dossier-discrediting denials. He never went to Prague to meet with Russian intelligence, as the dossier alleged, never heard anything about kompromat, and never had any direct evidence of Trumpian collusion with the Russians. Is it possible that a real conspiracy was run without the knowledge of the president’s trusted and then-proudly shady fixer? In theory, yes; it could have all happened through figures like Paul Manafort, who we know shared campaign polling data, at least, with a Russian-intelligence-linked figure. But if the dossier’s claim of a years-long Trump-Kremlin entanglement and its claim of Cohen’s direct involvement are both looking implausible or false, then its claims about a sustained Manafort-managed collaboration should be treated extremely skeptically as well. In which case the most likely l’affaire Russe endgame may be a special prosecutor’s report that doesn’t make Trump look good or decent or moral, but which implicitly exonerates him of conspiring with the Russians, and makes a lot of Mueller watchers extremely unhappy in the process.

Ironically, Douthat's support for one of the Steele dossier's claims has not actually been corroborated by the facts:

The Steele dossier made four big claims — or, since all those claims took the form of rumors and raw intelligence, let’s say that it raised four big possibilities. One of them, soon well corroborated, was that Russian intelligence was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the release of stolen emails through WikiLeaks.

Um, Ross, in case you aren't aware of it, let's remind you that the DNC refused to turn their server over to the FBI for inspection. You might also remember that Jussie Smollett refused to turn his cell phone over to the police so draw your own conclusion."

The TV personality returned to hosting her eponymous show after over two months of absence. Wearing a blonde bob, with a wad of gum in her mouth, the show host shared a vague story about the health reason behind her hiatus.

“I’m doin’ better now, let’s get started,” she told her excited audience as they cheered for her. “Thank you, I missed you too. I didn’t know what to expect when I hit the block today. I didn’t know if you would wait for me, whether you would understand. I had no idea what to expect. Thank you so much for waiting for us.”

“You know, I’m not exactly a hypochondriac, but I might be a hypa,” she began, adding that she had felt “thyroidish” around the end of her holiday recess. “If I cough I’m thinking I’m dying.”

“I’m 54, and not for nothing, even though you feel 25, honey, you know, you’re still your age on the inside,” she said.

She continued, “I just wanted to take some time for myself,” and went off a tangent talking about how she was accompanied by her husband and son (both named Kevin Hunter), the healthcare system in the U.S., that she was at home, taking thyroid meds, meditating, and that she had been going to the gym for two hours a day, seven days a week.

“I don’t know how this outfit is reading on TV but Mother has not gained a pound,” she told the crowd.

She concluded by apologizing that it took “40 or 50” days to return to air. “It’s not gonna happen anymore and I feel good,” said Williams.

And then she launched into a discussion of Jussie Smollett, whose case she had clearly been dying to talk about in front of a national audience as it unraveled last month.

On Monday, the 54-year-old gossip queen appeared in good spirits as she received a rousing standing ovation from her studio audience, dressed in a $2,200 Valentino dress, and sporting a sleek new bob.

If you were on your grind through the day and missed the broadcast, no worries! Below is a list of the top three things we learned from Williams’ triumphant return.

She has a clean bill of health

“I’m doing better now. Let’s get started, because apparently, I’m a Hot Topic.”

Williams wasted no time giving concerned fans an update on her battle against Graves’ disease, which despite what the gossip blogs have alleged, has always been cited as the official reason for her hiatus.

“We were supposed to only be off for two weeks for Christmas vacation … I started to feel thyroid issues. They’re still adjusting my meds,” she said. “I’m the kind of patient, if I cough, I’m thinking, I’m dying … I can’t even tell you how many doctors I have. They pushed me in there, I get the MRIs and then I get the catscans. … You know, I’m 54, and not for nothing even though you feel 25, honey you know. …

“I have a plethora of doctors,” she added. “And I’m happy to tell you that I am doing swell. And then you know it’s not a big thing for (husband and son) Kevin and Kevin to come with me for doctor’s appointments. … So we were spending time as a family, the Hunters … and I just wanted to take some time for myself … you know I am my own best friend.”

She’s still happily married

For over a year headlines have alleged that the daytime host’s husband and business partner Kevin Hunter has been abusive towards her and her staff while also having a longterm affair with a younger women.

These rumors led many to speculate that the fallout from Hunter’s destructive behavior was the true cause for Williams’ absence. But not only did she dispute those claims she also shared that both her husband and her son were by her side while she healed.

“I want to shout-out to my husband. I’m still wearing my ring,” she said as the audience applauded. “Believe me you, when you’ve been with somebody for 28 years, married for 25 years … we know each other. He’s my best friend, he’s my lover. … I know what you’ve been seeing .. but hunty, let me show you who I fell in love with and who he fell in love with.”

Williams then showed a picture from 20 years ago showing the couple during less glamorous days, before her talk show or any of her plastic surgery.

“I’m still very much in love with my husband and anyone who’s been married … you know.”

“Marriages have ebbs and flows, marriage isn’t easy. And don’t ask me about mine until you see this gone,” she continued, pointing to her wedding ring. “And it ain’t going anywhere, not in this lifetime.”

She thinks Jussie is guilty, but Micheal Jackson is innocent

Part of what makes the Wendy Williams Show destination viewing for so many of her loyal fans is her penchant for sharing unapologetic opinions about current events, which she refers to as, “Hot Topics.”

During Monday’s live taping she didn’t disappoint, covering everything from the alleged Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax to the controversial new Leaving Neverland documentary about child sexual abuse allegations against Michael Jackson.

“I think Jussie is guilty,” Williams stated bluntly to her studio audience.

She said Smollett was a sweet person who she enjoyed having on as a guest but admitted she was suspicious of his story from day one and never wavered. She also believes the attack was staged as a publicity stunt because the actor was not only seeking more money, but also attempting to come out of the shadow of his more successful sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell.

#WendyWilliams is just in denial of everything….her life…Michael Jackson's. So done — Gaia (@Gaiacentric) March 4, 2019

While Jussie may have been proven guilty until innocent in the host’s eyes, Jackson very decidedly got a pass from such scrutiny.

When guest correspondent Chris Witherspoon came on the show to discuss HBO’s explosive new documentary about the pop icon, Williams refused to take it seriously. Instead she repeated the familiar explanation that Jackson, “didn’t have a childhood,” and that a lot of the behaviors people called inappropriate were just his eccentric attempts to reclaim his lost innocence.

The mother of one also slammed the filmmakers and accusers Wade Robson and James Safechuck for for enacting what she calls, “a money grab.”"

Op-ed: The perils of faking a hate crime

In 1939 the legendary female jazz vocalist, Billie Holiday, recorded the classic song “Strange Fruit.” The poignant lyrics recount the suffering of black men who were brutally lynched in the Deep South during the Jim Crow Era. When Holiday sang the line “southern trees bear strange fruit,” she evoked the image of a black man with a noose tied around his neck as he was hanging from a tree limb.

Sadly, there was plenty of strange fruit hanging from Southern trees during most of the 20th Century. At that time, the Klux Ku Klan and other white supremacist groups used lynching to terrorize blacks and keep them in their place as second-class citizens. Thus, the noose became a symbolic reminder to blacks that the law could not protect them from being murdered if they failed to comply with the racial orthodoxy of the day.

In light of this shameful history of racial violence, it is ironic that Jussie Smollett, a gay black actor who stars in the television show “Empire,” may have recently perpetrated a faux attempted lynching in Chicago. He told police that two white men assaulted him while wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) caps and taunting him with racial slurs. He also claimed the assailants put a noose around his neck, doused him with bleach, and yelled “this is MAGA Country” during the beating. The hate crime purportedly occurred at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in subzero temperatures when Smollett was walking home from a local sandwich shop.

The police investigated Smollett’s story, but concluded it was a publicity stunt he orchestrated because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire” salary. Prior to the alleged attack, the police say Smollett sent himself a threatening letter which included a homophobic insult and a drawing of a stick figure wearing a noose around its neck. When the hate mail did not get the reaction Smollett wanted, the police say he upped the ante by staging the beating he allegedly received from a pair of Trump-supporting thugs. Police claim, however, these MAGA assailants were two Nigerian brothers who were paid $3,500 by Smollett to “attack” him. The area where the incident allegedly occurred was near his home and heavily surveilled by security cameras. The police, following an exhaustive probe, determined the attempted lynching was a fraud and arrested Smollett on charges related to filing a false police report.

Smollett is presumed innocent until proven guilty, just like any other criminal suspect. If, however, it is proven he fabricated an attempted lynching, he must be punished to the fullest extent of the law. There simply is no valid reason for anyone to lie about such a horrible crime. If Smollett is being untruthful, he has made it much more difficult for real victims of racial violence to get the justice they deserve. His conduct may also have aggravated racial tension in this country. Going forward, the criminal justice system will have to be careful to require more solid corroboration before crediting the word of anyone who claims to be the victim of a violent bias crime. Unfortunately, Smollett may have duped members of the public who were too willing to anoint him as the patron saint of bias crime victims. Everyone should now be forewarned that a mere accusation of racial violence without strong supporting evidence does not mean a bias crime actually occurred.

The economist Adam Smith once said “mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.” If Smollett is truly guilty, then a merciful sentence not involving incarceration would be a cruel rebuke to the memory of real victims of racial violence like the 14 year-old black Chicagoan named Emmet Till. In the summer of 1955 Till was lynched for allegedly making inappropriate remarks to a white woman while he was visiting his uncle in Mississippi. If Smollett feigned the attempted lynching for personal gain or for political reasons, he is unworthy to be mentioned in the same breath as Till or any other bona fide victim of hate-inspired lynching.

How many times is too many for someone to tell you their boyfriend would love it if you had sex with them? Dopetown 3000’s consistently delightful interviews-turned-freestyles get blessed up this episode by comedian and actor Dhruv Uday Singh (Good Trouble, I’m Too Effing High) and his tale of cuck. Singh went six and a half months without a first date until he hooked up with wholesome glass of milk Jennifer. Her name isn’t Jennifer, of course, and she definitely has a boyfriend. His witty descriptions of sex almost sound like choreography, and his rapport with hosts Zora Bikangaga, Shaun Fisher, and Greg Smith makes this one of the most sexually thrilling freestyles of the series, earning it a parental warning. This episode will bring you pleasure, whatever you’re into. [Morgan McNaught]

From fiction-podcast producers extraordinaire Night Vale Presents, Dreamboy has quickly cemented itself as one of the most interesting new shows around. It’s a strange series that always keeps listeners on their toes with its weird and wonderful writing, and this episode, “The Rally,” is no exception. The story, which follows spun-out musician Dane as he receives mysterious cakes meant for the boy next door and meets neighbors who all have their own stories to tell, is set against the backdrop of the eerie Pepper Heights Zoo and the campaign to save Zoe the zebra, led by three surreal girl scouts that Dane can’t seem to escape. This storyline comes to a head this week in an ethereal nighttime adventure where symbols unravel, secrets are revealed, and only a couple laws are broken. [Alma Roda-Gil]

Food 4 Thot focuses on relationships, race, sex, and identity hosted by Fran Tirado (Deputy Editor, Out magazine), Tommy Pico (poet), Dennis Norris II (former figure skater, former violinist, current writer), and Joseph Osmundson (scientist and non-fiction writer). This episode they’re joined by guest Steven Canals, creator of FX’s ’80s dance musical Pose. Having such a diverse group of hosts is beautifully refreshing when it comes to queer, male conversations, and the entire series is a necessary addition to investigations of queer identity, adding nuance with valuably specific voices. From Tirado’s childhood surrounded by the art of Diego Rivera, to Steven Canals’ experience getting into screenwriting, their shared journeys are inspiring for queer POC to hear. The hosts (who are PhD-holding, successful, intellectual, and queer men of color) manage what few podcasts can: the artful turn from fun, frothy, pop-culture commentary to touching, hard, inspiring anecdotes on the work that goes into elevating and amplifying the narratives of often marginalized individuals.

It’s fitting that most of the conversations in the first episode of the BBC Sounds podcast NB take place in liminal spaces. Faced with the prospect of coming out as nonbinary to their family in Australia, host Caitlin Benedict discusses the process of realizing their gender while on trains, at thresholds, and walking down stairwells. Co-host Amrou Al-Kadhi, Museum of Transology curator E.J. Scott, and drag performer Victoria Sin discuss their own experiences outside the gender binary, illustrating gender’s entanglement with cultural, religious, and generational experience. This episode is a perfect introduction to nonbinary identity for listeners who might not be familiar with it, while still being interesting and informative for those who are. Although the premise of the show might sound disconcertingly raw at first, gender self-discovery is, as Bennett says, often internal to the point of being isolating. Amplifying that process through other voices destroys that isolation. Bennett’s anxiety about their gender audibly evolves into excitement throughout the episode: They begin their journey already not alone, with the sound of wherever they’re going all around them.

For most people around the country, corruption and Illinois politics are practically synonymous. So when Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was accused in 2008 of attempting to sell off President-elect Barack Obama’s vacated senate seat exchange for political gain, no one was all that surprised. But this blatantly illegal backroom deal is really just one part of Blagojevich’s lengthy political career, one that, prior to being plagued by scandal, was filled with so much promise. Over the past six weeks, WBEZ in Chicago has been detailing Blagojevich’s rise and fall from working-class Democratic representative to convicted felon. This episode covers the bizarre PR campaign the ex-governor embarked on in the weeks after his initial arrest and removal from office. Against better judgement, Blagojevich appeared on numerous talk shows and news programs, framing himself as a “good guy” caught in a bad situation. Unfortunately for him, the hours of taped phone recordings secured by the FBI tell a different story. It was also during this time that Blagojevich appeared on The Celebrity Apprentice and formed his initial relationship with Donald Trump. In a bizarre twist of fate, that relationship could provide the disgraced governor with his best shot at a pardon. [Dan Neilan]

Nearly everyone has gotten scammed at least once, and that’s what fascinates ScamWow hosts Caitlin Brodnick and Sue Smith, who sit down each week and discuss the many different large- and small-scale cons that catch their attention. They recently sat down with comedian Abby Holland as she recounted a Halloween night that started with a voicemail and soon involved a stolen car on the border of Texas and Mexico, as well as a drug cartel and the CIA. The entire hour-long episode will keep listeners captivated, anxious, and questioning what they would do if they were in Abby’s shoes. Throughout Abby’s story, Caitlin and Sue provide the validation, emotional support, and comic relief that anyone who has ever been scammed would appreciate. [Nichole Williams]

It’s always fascinating to hear science writer Brian Dunning weigh in on the latest wellness trends; diet fads, in particular, are a deep well he continues to return to ever since taking down wheatgrass juice way back in 2006. Dunning bristles at being labeled a mere debunker, but the reality is that his show knocks down far more ideas than it props up. That’s what makes the few topics that pass muster so enthralling. Newly installed among that group is the keto diet, albeit with several qualifications, chief among them being that any diet works so long as fewer calories are consumed than burned. Dunning even hesitates to throw cold water on theories that ketosis—a metabolic state where fat is converted into ketone bodies to fuel cells—could help treat neurological diseases, saying it’s an idea with merit, if little in the way of actual evidence at this point. But unless you’re a diabetic or epileptic, he recommends considering other diets that come without common keto side effects like “keto flu,” halitosis, constipation, and diminished athletic performance.

Small Doses With Amanda Seales

Side Effects Of Fame

When it’s awards season, fame flu sweeps the country, and it’s easy to see why it’s so contagious. Celebrities pose in stunning custom gowns, give red carpet interviews, and deliver tearful acceptance speeches that can make even the most hardened critic smile at all the glamour. On this episode of Small Doses, host Amanda Seales explores the hidden side effects of fame, the ones ladened with personal responsibility instead of social media buzz. With her signature enthusiasm, Amanda highlights the differences between being known for a namesake and being known for producing quality work. To her, there’s a hefty distinction between fame and prestige. It takes more than having the masses knowing who you are to be legendary; it takes being busy like you’ve never been busy before and stepping out of your celebrity status to maintain your integrity and self-awareness. The “gem drop” pinging sound you’ll hear is your indicator to take notes and remember that eventually the ball gowns go back on the hanger and the trophies collect dust. So if you’re going to pursue fame, make sure you pack your principles in your suitcase. [Nekala Alexander]

No topics are off-limits when it comes to Charlamagne Tha God and Andrew Schulz’s witty discussions about race, politics, pop culture, and life. The friends and constant collaborators sit down to go over the recent controversies that have plagued the fashion industry, and they have a spirited debate on whether Colin Kaepernick is actually a martyr, breaking down his current standing with the NFL and what this means for his cause going forward. From there, the hosts offer their insight on the Tristan Thompson and Khloé Kardashian scandal and asked the question on everyone’s mind: Why does Thompson keep getting caught in “public displays of infidelity”? Even though the news cycle has been relentless, both Charlamagne and Schulz agree that they had their suspicions about the Jussie Smollett controversy from the beginning, but Charlamagne was more interested in exploring why the current generation feels the need to have an instant opinion on everything. Is it possible this country has an unhealthy obsession with celebrity? The answer is yes, but the pair also believes there was and is way more to this story than meets the eye. [Vannessa Jackson]

The End Of Time And Other Bothers

Point Of Contact

The world of “actual play” podcasts (as in, people actually playing tabletop RPGs together) has exploded since the advent of the massively popular The Adventure Zone in 2014. One of the standouts in this genre is The End Of Time And Other Bothers, the story of a human, a half-demon, and a fairy from a bureaucratic future who are pulled into the past to stop the end of time (and, you know, other bothers). What makes The End Of Time And Other Bothers especially delightful is the hosts’ commitment to their story: Before recording, they took improv classes to make sure they were all on their A-game. They don’t just commit to the comedy, though; that training comes through in the drama, especially with “Point Of Contact.” In this episode, everything the team’s been working to comes to a head as one of the player characters, Darcy, faces The Shattering—the ominous force threatening the timelines. The episode’s sound design heightens the conflict in the episode, slowing the action down so much it becomes more like a musical arrangement as the stakes get higher and higher. [Wil Williams]

Heartbreak is an intrinsic part of being a sports fan, and Rhea Butcher’s Three Swings continues to highlight the specific heartbreaks of being a LGBTQ sports fan. Butcher is joined by writer and Cubs fan Parker Molloy to discuss their history with the team, which includes using day games as an excuse to get drunk at noon, and their complex feelings about the current owners who have political and financial ties with the GOP and President Trump. Three Swings has always been about weightier topics than just stats and game predictions, though Butcher can reel off the former and ponder the latter with the best of them. Issues touched upon in the interview include homophobia, domestic abuse, and racism in baseball. Covering these subjects opens the podcast’s appeal to a wider audience: Even if you don’t like baseball, these same problems haunt every form of sports and other mass entertainment today. There is a general optimism to the episode, with acknowledgments from Molloy that some change is happening for the better. At one point, however, Butcher does admit, “I don’t have hope for anything because hope is false.” [Anthony D. Herrera]

The production studio of HartLife NFP, known for the long-running and critically acclaimed fiction podcast Our Fair City, has returned this week with the first three episodes of Unwell: A Midwestern Gothic Mystery. Protagonist Lily Harper moves back to the small, desolate, and weird town of Mt. Absalom, Ohio, to take care of her ill mother and her mother’s boarding house. “The Pageant” forefronts character relationships while not leaving aside the conspiratorial mystery of the town. Lily and Dot Harper enact the estranged and bitter dance of their cringeworthy dysfunction, while Abby Douglas critiques the erasure of Native Americans in white colonizer mythology through a fiery and confrontational speech. Unwell’s strongest element is how gothic it remains while subverting the worst tropes of the genre. Unwell doesn’t shy away from lingering in its superb sound and musical design to highlight how creepy Mt. Absalom is, as heard in a town anthem about the celery crop, in the echoing squeal of a microphone as it fades into a brief, awkward silence, and in the Southern gothic stomp and folksy strum of the theme music.

Op-ed: The perils of faking a hate crime

Smollett has been accused with arranging a homophobic, racist attack against himself in an attempt to raise his profile because he was dissatisfied with his salary. less “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett leaves Cook County jail after posting bond on Feb. 21, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1939 the legendary female jazz vocalist, Billie Holiday, recorded the classic song “Strange Fruit.” The poignant lyrics recount the suffering of black men who were brutally lynched in the Deep South during the Jim Crow Era. When Holiday sang the line “southern trees bear strange fruit,” she evoked the image of a black man with a noose tied around his neck as he was hanging from a tree limb.

Sadly, there was plenty of strange fruit hanging from Southern trees during most of the 20th Century. At that time, the Klux Ku Klan and other white supremacist groups used lynching to terrorize blacks and keep them in their place as second-class citizens. Thus, the noose became a symbolic reminder to blacks that the law could not protect them from being murdered if they failed to comply with the racial orthodoxy of the day.

In light of this shameful history of racial violence, it is ironic that Jussie Smollett, a gay black actor who stars in the television show “Empire,” may have recently perpetrated a faux attempted lynching in Chicago. He told police that two white men assaulted him while wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) caps and taunting him with racial slurs. He also claimed the assailants put a noose around his neck, doused him with bleach, and yelled “this is MAGA Country” during the beating. The hate crime purportedly occurred at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in subzero temperatures when Smollett was walking home from a local sandwich shop.

The police investigated Smollett’s story, but concluded it was a publicity stunt he orchestrated because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire” salary. Prior to the alleged attack, the police say Smollett sent himself a threatening letter which included a homophobic insult and a drawing of a stick figure wearing a noose around its neck. When the hate mail did not get the reaction Smollett wanted, the police say he upped the ante by staging the beating he allegedly received from a pair of Trump-supporting thugs. Police claim, however, these MAGA assailants were two Nigerian brothers who were paid $3,500 by Smollett to “attack” him. The area where the incident allegedly occurred was near his home and heavily surveilled by security cameras. The police, following an exhaustive probe, determined the attempted lynching was a fraud and arrested Smollett on charges related to filing a false police report.

Smollett is presumed innocent until proven guilty, just like any other criminal suspect. If, however, it is proven he fabricated an attempted lynching, he must be punished to the fullest extent of the law. There simply is no valid reason for anyone to lie about such a horrible crime. If Smollett is being untruthful, he has made it much more difficult for real victims of racial violence to get the justice they deserve. His conduct may also have aggravated racial tension in this country. Going forward, the criminal justice system will have to be careful to require more solid corroboration before crediting the word of anyone who claims to be the victim of a violent bias crime. Unfortunately, Smollett may have duped members of the public who were too willing to anoint him as the patron saint of bias crime victims. Everyone should now be forewarned that a mere accusation of racial violence without strong supporting evidence does not mean a bias crime actually occurred.

The economist Adam Smith once said “mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.” If Smollett is truly guilty, then a merciful sentence not involving incarceration would be a cruel rebuke to the memory of real victims of racial violence like the 14 year-old black Chicagoan named Emmet Till. In the summer of 1955 Till was lynched for allegedly making inappropriate remarks to a white woman while he was visiting his uncle in Mississippi. If Smollett feigned the attempted lynching for personal gain or for political reasons, he is unworthy to be mentioned in the same breath as Till or any other bona fide victim of hate-inspired lynching.

Williams, 54, walked onto her studio stage Monday to a rousing standing ovation from the audience, looking emotional as she offered her familiar greeting: “How you doin’?’”

“I’m doing better now,” she said. “Let’s get started, because apparently, I’m a Hot Topic.”

She explained that she’d been off the air since the holidays due to her medical problems, including thyroid issues, and took more time to heal with her family: husband Kevin Hunter Sr. and son Kevin Jr.

“We were supposed to only be off for two weeks for Christmas vacation … I started to feel thyroid issues. They’re still adjusting my meds,” she said. “I’m the kind of patient, if I cough, I’m thinking, I’m dying … I can’t even tell you how many doctors I have. They pushed me in there, I get the MRIs and then I get the catscans. … You know, I’m 54, and not for nothing even though you feel 25, honey you know. …

“I have a plethora of doctors,” she added. “And I’m happy to tell you that I am doing swell. And then you know it’s not a big thing for Kevin and Kevin to come with me for doctor’s appointments. … So we were spending time as a family, the Hunters … and I just wanted to take some time for myself … you know I am my own best friend.”

Williams said she’s been exercising during her absence, too: “I’m at home and I’m taking my thyroid meds and I’m meditating. … I’m going to the gym seven days a week for two hours a day. Believe me you. I don’t know how this outfit is reading on TV, but mother has not gained a pound.”

She then launched into a critique of the health care system: “But you have to take care of yourself and one of the things that really does suck about our country is we don’t have proper medical care.”

Williams joke about her son, adding, “Young Kevin, he really doesn’t care about much of anything … you know, jerks at 18. So i was doing that, just taking care — take care of yourselves. I’m sorry it took me 40, almost 50 days. I’m sorry … but I have to say it’s not going to happen anymore, and I feel good.”

During her Hot Topics discussion of the Jussie Smollett scandal, she teared up while discussing he son again.

“I just really gotta focus on being mom,” she said. “When you see us doing stuff walking down the street or stuff … just leave me alone if I’m with my kid or my husband or my mom or my dad or my sister or my brother.”

“I’m all cried out, I swear, I can’t cry anymore,” she added, overwhelmed by her studio audience’s cheers.

Then, she turned to rumors that have been swirling about her marriage.

“I want to shout-out to my husband. I’m still wearing my ring,” she said. “Believe me you, when you’ve been with somebody for 28 years, married for 25 years … we know each other. He’s my best friend, he’s my lover. … I know what you’ve been seeing .. but hunty, let me show you who I fell in love with and who he fell in love with.”

A decades-old photo of the couple popped onto the screen, and the crowd went wild.

“I’m still very much in love with my husband and anyone who’s been married … you know.”

“Marriages have ebbs and flows, marriage isn’t easy. And don’t ask me about mine until you see this gone,” she added, gesturing to her wedding ring. “And it ain’t going anywhere, not in this lifetime.”

The host first took a leave of absence from The Wendy Williams Show on Dec. 6. The talk show host, who said she fractured her shoulder in December, was supposed to resume taping on Jan. 14. Her return was then pushed back to Jan. 21 before the show announced that she would be taking a “necessary, extended break from her show to focus on her personal and physical well-being.” (Williams has Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid.)

Before her return, Nick Cannon, who helped host the show during her absence, also shot down split rumors.

“We was tearing up and everything because she said something to me that was actually really powerful,” he said. “Because you know me and Wendy had a love-hate relationship over the years. But it’s nothing but love because I love my queen and when she said this — she said there can be negativity out there and she hears the things about people talking about her family unit and what’s going on and she was like, ‘You know what, we don’t want to bring that negative energy when you’re trying to heal.’ “

During Williams’ absence, the show continued to produce original episodes with a variety of hosts serving in her absence, such as Cannon, Michael Rappaport, and Jerry O’Connell.

The university said in a lengthy statement from its public affairs office that the reporting on the Feb. 19 assault of Leadership Institute field representative Hayden Williams and the subsequent arrest of 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg had been ""willfully distorted and inaccurately reported.""

It recounted how the university police department sent a message to campus following the reporting of the assault and how the school released a statement condemning violence. It balked at people ""around the country"" assuming the assailant was a student and ""armchair experts"" expressing disbelief and anger over the suspect not being arrested more quickly:

In certain quarters of the media world theatrical outrage was expressed regarding the university’s supposed failure to prevent the criminal act in question. We readily admit that this university—like every single town, city, county, and state in this country—is unable to prevent a lone bad actor who was neither employee or student from engaging in reprehensible behavior on a campus spanning 1,200 acres and a population of 50,000 people. We don’t see a way to do that, but that doesn’t mean our police force and the administration don’t awaken every morning trying their best to deter criminal behavior and keep our campus safe. That objective is supported by imposing appropriate consequences when rules and laws are violated, and we have done everything in our power to make sure that happens in this instance, as in all others. We have an excellent police force, dedicated to one thing: the safety and well-being of the campus community. In the days that followed, armchair experts with seemingly little understanding of how a police department and the office of the local district attorney operate, or of the investigative norms that are applied to all cases, not to mention the details of this particular case, immediately expressed disbelief and anger that the suspect had not been arrested. These critics stated without substantiation that the delay was somehow due to the imputed political beliefs of the campus administration. In so doing, they willfully impugned the integrity and independence of the excellent officers of the UCPD who seek to uphold the law regardless of who the perpetrators are, or what they happen to believe in.

The university initially stated last Tuesday the investigation had been completed, but the Alameda County District Attorney's office told the Washington Free Beacon the following day the probe was ongoing. The university then confirmed the police were conducting additional investigative work to assess what charges should be filed. Greenberg was arrested and booked on Friday after what the university said was a ""complex investigation.""

Berkeley also blasted the ""absurd allegations"" questioning the university's commitment to free speech, pointing to the ""incontestable fact"" that it had hosted numerous conservative speakers without incident:

Finally, the absurd allegations regarding UC Berkeley’s support for free speech and all of its students, regardless of their perspectives, have no basis in fact. In the last year alone, this University spent more than $4 million to ensure that our conservative students could safely and successfully hold events on campus and invite speakers of their choice to these events. Although we made every effort to inform the media, not a single outlet reported on the incontestable fact that these conservative student groups hosted a large number of conservative speakers, including Charlie Kirk (founder of Turning Point USA), Rick Santorum, Dennis Prager, Heather MacDonald, Candace Owens, Dave Rubin, Steve Simpson, Antonia Okafor and Allie Stuckey. Not a single disruption. No opposition. No protest. No coverage. Our commitment to freedom of speech and belief is unwavering and no amount of incomplete, distorted news coverage is going to change that.

Berkeley couldn't comment on what made the investigation ""complex"" for fear of jeopardizing the case against Greenberg, but Vice Chancellor Dan Mogulof told the Free Beacon any outlets that claimed bias by the school against conservatives without noting the money it spent to feature conservative speakers weren't telling ""the whole truth.""

""Any outlet that claimed the campus administration has shown some sort of bias towards conservative students and or conservative thought without noting the amount of money the university has spent to ensure that events featuring a large number of conservative speakers could be held safely and successfully, was not telling the whole truth. Journalism demands balance, context, and a foundation built on facts,"" he said.

The school is well-known for its left-wing politics and incidents of radical ""Antifa"" violence in and around campus over the past, such as riots over the planned appearance of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Both the site of the attack on Williams and the fact it was largely captured on camera led to the story gaining the attention of the national media and even the White House.

Tabling on behalf of the right-wing student group Turning Point on the campus's main plaza, Williams was accosted by two men who were angry about a sign referencing the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax. One of them flipped over his table, shouted curses at him and punched him in the face, leaving him with a black left eye.

He told Fox News, before the arrest, that he hoped for due process for the suspect, and he also praised the university's police department. He criticized the school itself, though, for the culture of intolerance he said was prevalent there.

President Donald Trump invited Williams up to speak during his lengthy speech at CPAC on Saturday, praising the young activist for taking the punch well and encouraging him to sue his attacker, the university, and even the state of California. Williams thanked Trump and said he would continue to fight discrimination against conservatives on college campuses.

Berkeley College Republicans president Matt Ronnau, a junior, told the Free Beacon last week the school didn't do enough to keep conservatives safe when expressing their views. He said he's felt threatened while tabling in the plaza and even been spit on.

""It's the same thing every time when something like this happens. ‘We affirm our right to free speech and this is bad,' but they don't really do anything about it,"" he said after the assault. ""They haven't done anything really to address the problem and try to keep conservatives and Berkeley College Republicans from getting attacked when we express our viewpoint."""

BALTIMORE — What police now say was a false story of a Good Samaritan from Harford County being killed after giving money to a panhandler in East Baltimore played on the worst stereotypes of the city and created widespread — and unwarranted — hysteria about the threats posed by the homeless, officials said Sunday.

The killing of Jacquelyn Smith in December was not, in fact, committed by a robber pretending to thank her for handing a few dollars out the car window to a panhandling woman with a baby in her arms, as her husband and stepdaughter tearfully claimed, police said in a news conference.

Instead, Keith Smith, 52, and Valeria Smith, 28, were arrested Sunday by Texas State Police in Harlingen, near the Mexican border, and charged with first-degree murder while trying to flee the country, acting Baltimore police Commissioner Michael Harrison said.

The initial story, coming at the end of Baltimore’s fourth straight year of more than 300 homicides, made national headlines and prompted feelings of outrage and hopelessness about the city. Baltimore’s long-standing reputation for violence played into the case, said the acting police commissioner, mayor and state’s attorney.

“People take advantage of Baltimore,” Harrison said. “What we want to make sure is that the truth comes out and justice is done.”

Mayor Catherine Pugh said the suspects used the issues of homelessness, crime and poverty that have long plagued the city to stage her death as a Good Samaritan killing.

“These individuals took advantage of a situation, a city that is already dealing with its own problems,” Pugh said. “We’re looking forward to this cruel act being brought to justice.”

State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who accompanied Harrison and Pugh at the news conference, noted that the city’s negative image played into the ruse.

“Oftentimes we have these negative depictions about our city, and it’s rather unfortunate when people take advantage of these negative perceptions,” Mosby said. “This is an example where collaborative efforts of the Baltimore Police Department and my office were able to get to the truth of the matter.”

The lie affected more than just the city’s public relations efforts. Panhandlers in Baltimore told The Sun they heard the click of door locks and saw a large drop in donations in the days after the killing.

Blaming a murder on an already vulnerable and often stereotyped group of people is “reprehensible,” said Kevin Lindamood, president and CEO of Health Care for the Homeless.

“This claim was made and then suddenly there was outright fear of vulnerable people on the street,” Lindamood said. “You turned on any news station and you heard people talking about this news story in a very sensational way.”

Because of their poverty, homeless people are often assumed to be violent, when they are far more likely to be victims of violence than the perpetrators, he said.

“It’s never been uncommon for the larger public to stereotype populations living in poverty,” Lindamood said. “We find that particularly when it comes to the association between violence and homelessness, it’s just absolutely overblown.”

Oprah Winfrey tweeted in the days after the killing that Smith’s death “struck my heart” and that while she had given to homeless people 1,000 times, she would reconsider doing so again.

After police said the story was a hoax, Annie Milli, executive director of Live Baltimore, was among those asking the billionaire media mogul for an apology.

“Please issue an apology to Baltimore,” Milli tweeted. “This deserves outrage beyond the negative attention it put on our city. Please use your platform to unpack the real reason so many were so quick to jump on Baltimore City.”

Kirby Fowler, president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, called the case “unfortunate on so many levels.”

It reminded Fowler of the case of Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” actor who Chicago police allege staged and paid for a racist attack on himself to promote his career.

“When it comes to Baltimore, don’t believe everything you hear,” Fowler said. “I’ve lived here 28 years, raised kids here — it’s wonderful city. Sometimes people take advantage of our reputation to cover up crimes. It’s heinous.”

The story was always too far-fetched for Johnston Square resident Brandon Cottman to believe.

“I knew it was bogus from the start,” Cottman, 34, said Monday afternoon. “It seemed orchestrated from the beginning.”

Cottman said he has lived in the neighborhood for three years and had never heard of panhandling on the block of Valley Street where police initially said the stabbing happened after midnight.

“When I heard of the details … it didn’t sit right,” he said. “For someone to be panhandling in this neighborhood at that time, it is unheard of — especially on that block, which is desolate, even during the daytime.”

Johnston Square residents feel a “sense of betrayal” toward the suspects for allegedly framing their neighborhood as the site of a random killing, Cottman said.

“You had people walking around, getting pulled over, and harassed” after the killing, he said. “They probably felt like it wouldn’t be investigated because it was a minority, low-income area.”

(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)

By many measures, Johnston Square is one of Baltimore’s most impoverished neighborhoods, according to the “Vital Signs” report compiled by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance — Jacob France Institute at the University of Baltimore. The Greenmount East area, of which Johnston Square is part, has an unemployment rate of 25.8 percent, and 24.2 percent of family households there are living below the poverty line, the report found.

The killing was a blow to the neighborhood’s morale, and the news of the alleged lie has further upset those who live there, said Terence Alexel, 59, who lives there.

“I thought someone else did it,” Alexel said. “It was inconceivable.”

Lindamood, of Health Care for the Homeless, said destigmatizing homelessness and poverty, as well as avoiding the inclination to jump to assumptions, are key to ensuring scenarios like these don’t become sensationalized.

“Things like this are rooted in fear — fear of people who are different than we are,” he said. “We need to really work to break down these stereotypes that aren’t often based in reality, and this is a very powerful example of that phenomenon.”

She arrived onstage Monday with a blonde bob, a wad of gum in her mouth, and a vague story about the health reason(s) behind her hiatus.

She teared up as the crowd, during a 40-second ovation, chanted her name. She invoked her signature catchphrase—“How you doin’?”—and after the crowd parroted back, Williams said, “I’m doin’ better now, let’s get started.”

As Wiliams settled into the purple armchair from which she delivers the “Hot Topics” segment of her show, the studio audience gave her another extended ovation. “Thank you, I missed you too,” said Williams. “I didn’t know what to expect when I hit the block today. I didn’t know if you would wait for me, whether you would understand. I had no idea what to expect. Thank you so much for waiting for us.”

“You know, I’m not exactly a hypochondriac, but I might be a hypa,” is how her almost five-minute, halting story about her hiatus began. She was only supposed to be off the air for about two weeks around Christmas and New Years Day, but that extended through the months of January and February. Williams said she felt “thyroidish” around the end of her holiday recess (the host has discussed thyroid issues in the past, including her Graves disease), but allowed, “If I cough I’m thinking I’m dying.” She seemed to mostly blame herself for her absence. She did not mention the shoulder fracture that was reported on her Instagram in January.

“I’m 54, and not for nothing, even though you feel 25, honey, you know, you’re still your age on the inside,” she said.

“I just wanted to take some time for myself,” said Wendy, who also rode a tangent into a complaint about visiting doctors accompanied by her husband and son (both named Kevin Hunter), as well as the healthcare system in the U.S. She said during her time off, she was at home, taking thyroid meds, meditating, and that she had been going to the gym for two hours a day, seven days a week.

“I don’t know how this outfit is reading on TV but Mother has not gained a pound,” she told the crowd.

She concluded by apologizing that it took “40 or 50” days to return to air. “It’s not gonna happen anymore and I feel good,” said Williams. And then she launched into a discussion of Jussie Smollett, whose extraordinary case she had clearly been dying to talk about in front of a national audience as it unraveled last month. Welcome home, Wendy."

Maher began by blaming Jeff Bezos for courting wealthy cities like New York for his next Amazon headquarters while ignoring states he said would benefit most from thousands of new jobs. “That’s why red state voters are so pissed off,” he said. “They don’t hate us; they want to be us. They want to go the party. It’s like we’re the British royal family and they’re Meghan Markle’s dad.” You might argue that is Maher being Maher and as an entertainer he’s just throwing red meat to satisfy his audience. But two things are worth noting: The live audience applauded wildly at every insult he lobbed, and plenty of Americans think his jabs truly reflect how the blue-state cultural elite views people from red states.

It's not just Mahar, of course. Hollywood routinely and viciously insults and degrades ordinary people - especially southerners. The Covington Catholic incident at the Lincoln Memorial is a case in point:

When the students from Covington Catholic got into an altercation with a progressive Native American activist, they were immediately judged guilty of heinous behavior before anyone had found out the facts. Why? Well, they were from Kentucky and had MAGA hats on. Jussie Smollett’s allegations of an attack by racist whites wearing MAGA hats was also immediately reported as true by the national press and celebrities, because they assumed that, of course, a Trump supporter would do that. Like Maher’s rant, they see Middle America as white, stupid, racist and filled with envy.

What's truly astonishing about this attitude is that it knows no class or income bracket. Rich midwesterners and southerners are just as discerning as rich New Yorkers, but are insulted and degraded anyway.

Ken Garner, a 56-year-old semi-retired attorney who lives in the very red state of Texas, says he enjoys the finer things in life: good food, museums, books, tasteful clothing, nice cars, high technology and classical music, “all the things that Maher claims only blue state people like.” He says there is “not a shred of resentment as far as I can observe” from the people he meets across the Lone Star State towards those who live in blue states. Garner doesn’t care much for the president, so much so that his Republican voting streak, which began in 1980, ended in the last presidential election when he decided not to cast a vote. But he’s also weary of the red-state bashing and says he gets why people who voted for Trump are also tired of it. “I won’t vote for any Democrats,” he said.

In fact, the red state hate has gotten worse since Trump was elected. The hysterical denunciations of Trump are also targeting his supporters. The way the media covers a Trump rally is incredible. Attendees are described as almost sub-human - ignorant yahoos; violent, racist, and slavishly in love with Trump.

No one likes to be insulted - especially when they are told they are inferior to other people when they know they're not. It may be that the 2020 election will be Trump's to lose no matter how unpopular he may be. And Democrats will only have themselves to blame."

Williams, 54, walked onto her studio stage Monday to a rousing standing ovation from the audience, looking emotional as she offered her familiar greeting: “How you doin’?'”

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“I’m doing better now,” she said. “Let’s get started, because apparently, I’m a Hot Topic.”

She explained that she’d been off the air since the holidays due to her medical problems, including thyroid issues, and took more time to heal with her family: husband Kevin Hunter Sr. and son Kevin Jr.

“We were supposed to only be off for two weeks for Christmas vacation … I started to feel thyroid issues. They’re still adjusting my meds,” she said. “I’m the kind of patient, if I cough, I’m thinking, I’m dying … I can’t even tell you how many doctors I have. They pushed me in there, I get the MRIs and then I get the catscans. … You know, I’m 54, and not for nothing even though you feel 25, honey you know. …

“I have a plethora of doctors,” she added. “And I’m happy to tell you that I am doing swell. And then you know it’s not a big thing for Kevin and Kevin to come with me for doctor’s appointments. … So we were spending time as a family, the Hunters … and I just wanted to take some time for myself … you know I am my own best friend.”

Williams said she’s been exercising during her absence, too: “I’m at home and I’m taking my thyroid meds and I’m meditating. … I’m going to the gym seven days a week for two hours a day. Believe me you. I don’t know how this outfit is reading on TV, but mother has not gained a pound.”

She then launched into a critique of the health care system: “But you have to take care of yourself and one of the things that really does suck about our country is we don’t have proper medical care.”

Williams joke about her son, adding, “Young Kevin, he really doesn’t care about much of anything … you know, jerks at 18. So i was doing that, just taking care — take care of yourselves. I’m sorry it took me 40, almost 50 days. I’m sorry … but I have to say it’s not going to happen anymore, and I feel good.”

During her Hot Topics discussion of the Jussie Smollett scandal, she teared up while discussing he son again.

“I just really gotta focus on being mom,” she said. “When you see us doing stuff walking down the street or stuff … just leave me alone if I’m with my kid or my husband or my mom or my dad or my sister or my brother.”

“I’m all cried out, I swear, I can’t cry anymore,” she added, overwhelmed by her studio audience’s cheers.

Then, she turned to rumors that have been swirling about her marriage.

“I want to shout-out to my husband. I’m still wearing my ring,” she said. “Believe me you, when you’ve been with somebody for 28 years, married for 25 years … we know each other. He’s my best friend, he’s my lover. … I know what you’ve been seeing .. but hunty, let me show you who I fell in love with and who he fell in love with.”

A decades-old photo of the couple popped onto the screen, and the crowd went wild.

“I’m still very much in love with my husband and anyone who’s been married … you know.”

“Marriages have ebbs and flows, marriage isn’t easy. And don’t ask me about mine until you see this gone,” she added, gesturing to her wedding ring. “And it ain’t going anywhere, not in this lifetime.”

The host first took a leave of absence from The Wendy Williams Show on Dec. 6. The talk show host, who said she fractured her shoulder in December, was supposed to resume taping on Jan. 14. Her return was then pushed back to Jan. 21 before the show announced that she would be taking a “necessary, extended break from her show to focus on her personal and physical well-being.” (Williams has Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid.)

Before her return, Nick Cannon, who helped host the show during her absence, also shot down split rumors.

“We was tearing up and everything because she said something to me that was actually really powerful,” he said. “Because you know me and Wendy had a love-hate relationship over the years. But it’s nothing but love because I love my queen and when she said this — she said there can be negativity out there and she hears the things about people talking about her family unit and what’s going on and she was like, ‘You know what, we don’t want to bring that negative energy when you’re trying to heal.’ “

During Williams’ absence, the show continued to produce original episodes with a variety of hosts serving in her absence, such as Cannon, Michael Rappaport, and Jerry O’Connell."

People reports that the Osundairo brothers note that they feel “tremendous regret” for their involvement.

“My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation. And they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves,” their statement to CBS Chicago read.

That’s it?! For our involvement and defending them, we are quite disappointed, that no apology was issued with respect to ruining the Black History Month for us all.

Radio Show Host Howie Carr has compiled a list of differences between the way the mainstream media covers Democrats vs. Republicans. It would be amusing if it weren’t so sad.

1. Republicans have “fixers” while Democrats have lawyers.

2. To prevent the release of embarrassing information, Democrats’ lawyers negotiate NDA’s — nondisclosure agreements. Republican fixers’ NDAs are “hush money,” or “bribes.”

3. Hillary Clinton’s dossier, the basis for the FBI’s application to the FISA Court for a warrant to spy on an American citizen was “opposition research.” When Republicans engage in opposition research, it is called “collusion.”

4. Republicans “lie,” while Democrats “misspeak.”

5. Democrats plan, Republicans scheme.

6. Republicans hire lobbyists, Democrats use advocates. Republicans employ operatives or hired guns, Democrats prefer community activists.

7. If a Democrat changes his or her position on an issue, they have evolved … grown. Republicans “flip-flop.”

8. Any Republican involved in wrongdoing is immediately identified as such. If the perpetrator is a Democrat, however, that information comes after the third paragraph.

9. All Democrats believed Christine Blasey Ford’s uncorroborated accusations against now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Vanessa Tyson, who has a far more credible story about being sexually assaulted by Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Virginia, not so much.

10. Was Jussie Smollett’s fake hate crime ever referred to as “alleged?” Of course not. But all the real, documented, videotaped attacks on conservatives — invariably they are alleged, or “according to police reports.”

11. A Republican tax cut is a “corporate giveaway” for the rich, a boon to “one percenters” that the government “can’t afford.” A Democrat-proposed tax increase, though, is an “investment in the future.” It’s for the children.

12. When there’s bad news about Republicans, Democrats “react.” But Republicans “pounce” or “seize.”

13. Let’s talk about legislation. When a Democrat solon finds a way to stop some GOP initiative, it’s because the brilliant parliamentarian (Nancy Pelosi?) has come up with a master stroke.

But when a Republican, say Mitch McConnell, does exactly the same thing, he is invariably called an obstructionist, relying on “arcane” tricks to produce “gridlock” and overturn centuries of “Congressional tradition.”

14. When Democrats in Congress hold oversight hearings, they are never less than “historic” “explosive,” full of “bombshells.” The Cohen hearings were so explosive, in fact, that I was expecting to see footage Wednesday night of the Capitol in smoking ruins. Republican-run Congressional hearings are always described as grandstanding, sideshows, overreach and a total waste of taxpayer money.

15. Finally, the word of the day is “smirk.” Remember January’s first big fake-news hoax — the Covington Catholic high school students at the Lincoln Memorial. The kid in the Make America Great Again hat that day was Nicholas Sandmann, and he’s now suing the Washington Post for $250 million. Every Social Justice Warrior on Twitter said the 16-year-old had it coming because of the “smirk” on his face. That was the smart word of the day — smirk.

So last week the illegal immigrant from Brazil who assaulted — allegedly — the 23-year-old MAGA-hat- wearing American in the bar in Falmouth was grabbed by ICE for being in the country illegally for 25 years. She got a big-time lawyer and he said, basically, that after getting boozed up, the illegal immigrant went all Third World on the American taxpayer because of his “smirk.”

So now apparently it’s OK to assault anyone wearing a MAGA hat … if they’re “smirking.”

The Wall Street Journal’s Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., a Never-Trumper, wrote an excellent article entitled “The Media Will Reelect Trump.” In the article, he discusses how historians might characterize the mainstream media’s “fatuous” coverage of Trump.

They will wonder:

“How did so rich and complex a society as ours survive a pundit class so devoid of judgment, so incapable even of identifying what was interesting about the times they live in?”"

Hyman, a class action and mass tort attorney and advocate for consumers, is comparable to a modern-day Erin Brockovich. Besides being a fighter for justice, she also had a less than traditional upbringing when compared to most attorneys. The native Floridian was raised in New York City and Southern California, and has a number of acting credits under her belt, some of them dating back to her childhood. Kelly Hyman is probably best known for her role of Loretta on “The Young and the Restless,” and she also played Norman Fell’s daughter on the television show “Gettin’ There.” Over the years, Hyman has also worked on numerous commercials, including the now infamous Kit Kat “Gimme a break” ad.

Hyman does attribute some of her success as an attorney to skills she learned as an actress, but she also has an extensive education; she first earned a Bachelor’s degree in communications from UCLA and a Master’s degree in communications from Barry University before going on to law school. In 2003, she was awarded a J.D., with honors from the University of Florida College of Law.

Hyman’s devotion to her work and clients was recently recognized by the National Trial Lawyers; as KTVN.com noted, she was named as one of the Top 25 Class Action Trial Lawyers in the state of Colorado.

“The announcement came just after Kelly Hyman received the AV Preeminent Rating from Martindale-Hubbell, the highest rating possible, for her third consecutive year,” KTVN noted, adding that the National Trial Lawyers is an organization consisting of professional, premier trial lawyers from across the U.S.

Kelly Hyman is also a frequent contributor in the media, regularly contributing her expertise to journalists. Her skills in front of the camera are also being put to good use, as she continues to appear on various news outlets as well. Most recently, in the case surrounding Jussie Smollett, the up and coming actor who was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself, Kelly Hyman was able to use her background in acting and her knowledge of legal matters to lend a unique perspective on this case that has fascinated the nation. Hyman continues to appear in the media and speak at live events in her quest for justice. Tickets for the event will be available for sale.

In a dogpile of a mayoral race, 14 candidates fought it out to connect to voters who had long ago given into a nasty case of learned helplessness. The two top winners — both black women — beat out a rich scion of a Chicago political dynasty, a Latina state official, the city’s former top cop and a bevy of other local luminaries.

The two finalists are former assistant U.S. attorney Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. And no matter which one of them wins the April 2 runoff Chicago’s inauguration of a female African-American mayor will make a kind of history that none of the other top cities in America can claim.

It’s a stunning turn of events in a town known for never wanting “nobody nobody sent.”

And it’s a relief, indicating that there are still strides people of color can hope for after a long, miserable Black History Month, which featured allegations that top government officials in Virginia wore blackface in college.

Closer to home, there was collective fear and then outrage (of many different kinds) when it appeared that “Empire” star Jussie Smollett had staged a hate crime in which he claimed he was attacked by assailants who yelled racist and homophobic slurs.

Oh, and then there’s the cop-on-minority-resident issue. This inspired a federal consent decree requiring the Chicago Police Department to undergo reforms to ensure people of color are treated humanely by the law enforcement officers who are sworn to protect them.

And I’m also sick of the perceptions that Chicago’s murder rate is the highest in the nation — it’s not, and by some measures doesn’t even crack the top 20.

So, yeah, the city could use good news in the form of a historic change of leadership from Rahm Emanuel, a big-interests-focused political operator. Either one of these two women could, in theory, address the neglect of the African-American community, which has caused what some experts consider to be a mass migration of black people out of the city and into the suburbs, neighboring Indiana or the Southern states where the original Great Migration began.

Though we’ve earned a high-five, at this specific moment in politics, it may be a toss-up whether the Preckwinkle-Lightfoot battle is more interesting because of the race angle or the gender one.

For decades Chicago’s South Side communities had been a major economic engine for black communities and the city, but the city starved the neighborhoods of resources so much that its residents have, no doubt, come to believe that their votes don’t count.

That perception wasn’t helped by initial precinct returns showing the two front-runners were elected not by the grassroots of the city’s African-American base, but by predominantly white wards on the North Side of the heavily segregated city.

So what’s left to watch?

How these two women — both very strong candidates who are in a struggle to differentiate themselves as more progressive than the other — will demonstrate executive competence and leadership without falling off the tightrope of being “likable” vs. “shrill” or “bossy.”

These are exemplars that the female Democrats who have declared their candidacy for president would do well to keep an eye on.

At least it won’t be a boring race. As evidenced by her campaign thus far, Lightfoot — a self-proclaimed out and proud black lesbian — has seemingly never even heard of the “be nice” political playbook that’s expected of women politicians — perhaps a winning formula for other, future female high-office candidates?

Lightfoot came out a-brawlin’ the day after the election, accusing Preckwinkle of squandering the opportunity to take a leadership role in preventing the violence in the city. Lightfoot also accused Preckwinkle of refusing to address poverty, spreading false rumors, and threatening to “take her out” of the mayor’s race.

Preckwinkle, a consummate Chicago machine-politics player, will certainly land her own well-funded punches in the next five weeks leading up to the run-off.

Whoever emerges as the winner however, will require time to set up shop and expand her powers.

Her story will, for at least a while, inevitably be more about how she convinced voters of all stripes to trust in her, rather than about what she does once in office.

That glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton said was left with a million cracks in it after her loss in 2016? The 2020 presidential candidates who want to finally break through it will do well to follow this race closely.

Brianne Howey has mastered a variety of roles on screen, including a vampiric “Viral” in the latest Fox drama, The Passage. From comedy to horror to sci-fi, this actress has done it all and is not slowing down anytime soon. Our Brianne Howey wiki will certainly give you reason to keep an eye on this rising starlet.

She’s from California

Brianne Howey was born on May 24, 1989 and is 29 years old. She and her sister, Cailan Howey, grew up in La Cañada Flintridge, California.

Brianne attended the all-girl Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy and later moved to the east coast for college. She graduated from New York University’s Tisch School of Arts in 2011 with a BFA in theater.

While at Tisch, she built her resume with a number of roles in TV and film. After graduating, she returned to Los Angeles and pursued her acting career.

She Started with Guest Roles on TV

As a child, Howey dreamed of becoming a flight attendant and traveling the world. However, her old inclination towards theater and improv classes turned into a career that took her places.

While still a student at Tisch, she starred in short films before bagging her first TV role in 90210, the Beverly Hills 90210 reboot. She later had an appearance on NCIS.

Howey’s first role as a recurring character was in The Middle. That was followed by a three-episode role in Revenge and a four-episode arc in Twisted.

Over the years, Howey has appeared in guest roles in shows like Criminal Minds, Baby Daddy, Hart of Dixie, Hawaii Five-0, and many other TV shows.

She also had a role in the Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman movie Horrible Bosses 2.

Her acting credits steadily grew and soon, she found herself in London filming the Comedy Central UK series I Live with Models. She had sold her apartment in L.A. to move to the U.K. for the role. Although it’s filmed in London, the show is set in Miami, Florida and is essentially an American sitcom.

A constant stream of guest roles allowed Howey to try a variety of characters. “You have to be a sponge and take it all in, and you get to meet so many people in this short period of time,” she said. “It helps you learn.”

Her career is only soaring. She recently worked on the movie Plus One, which is currently in post-production and expected to be released in 2019.

She Is a Regular in Fox Shows

After a two-part appearance in Fox’s Scream Queens, Howey got her big break in the Fox horror series The Exorcist. She portrayed Kat Rance, the odd daughter in the Rance family who is dealing with a demonic presence in their home.

Howey returned from London after wrapping up I Live with Models, found a new apartment in L.A., and began working in Hollywood. The folks at Fox were probably impressed by her talent since she was one of the first in the lineup of actors cast for their new post-apocalyptic series, The Passage.

The same casting directors that cast Howey in The Exorcist were there at her audition for The Passage. “[I] did the scene, and he kind of gave me a smile, and I was like, ‘I don’t really know how to read this,’ but then I got a callback. And then another one. And then you make it to the testing level, and everybody’s in the room with you, and you kind of bust it out, and that’s how I landed there,” said Brianne about the casting process.

Based on Justin Cronin’s bestselling book trilogy and a screenplay by Ridley Scott, The Passage is set in the future where a botched government experiment on death-row inmates has turned them into voiceless, veiny beings with vampire-like abilities called the Virals.

Howey plays one of the Virals, Shauna Babcock. Incidentally, she also worked in a movie titled Viral. She and her fellow Virals spend more than two hours in makeup getting the veins and prosthetics on.

In the books, Babcock was a man, so the original author, Cronin appeared to have his reservations about Howey’s Shauna. However, after watching the series, Cronin reached out to Howey and supported her work.

She’s in a Relationship

Much to some broken hearts, Brianne Howey is off the market. Judging from her Instagram, she’s dating one Matt Ziering.

He’s not a celebrity and appears to be an attorney based in California. He acquired his Juris Doctor in 2015 from Loyola Law School at Loyola Marymount University in California.

During this time, Americans are surrounded by echoes of the past, and these words of affirmation and ethnic pride are to whisper the secrets of a better future for black Americans today.

But a series of events occurring this February has me questioning the direction that we as a society — a “black” society — are taking. It has me wondering if we are ready to move forward — especially those of “us” on the Left.

Hardly a way to start a month-long observance of blackness, news surfaced surrounding the Jussie Smollett controversy in Chicago. But it only took a few days to unveil the true face of his claims — a race-baiting hoax attempt perpetrated by two Nigerian brothers. As rapper Cardi B so bluntly put it, Smollett “F-ed Up” Black History Month. I tend to agree with her sentiments, calling into question whether this is (perhaps coincidentally) the time to stage a fake hate crime when so much evil is already being afflicted on black Americans, especially those in Democrat-run towns.

While everyone was reeling over Smollett’s fictional crisis, 30 people were shot — in the very same city — in only a short three-hour timeframe. Eleven of the victims were teenagers. One was just 11 years old. Still, Democrats and leftists who run that town have done little if anything to resolve the out-of-control crime plaguing black families. The Windy City has become our nation’s epicenter of the black-on-black crime for decades. How many more Februarys need to pass before our black Chicagoans can partake in the prosperity promised by their forefathers?

Meanwhile, Democrats voted against legislation to prevent newborns and full-term babies from being aborted, knowing good and well that the black population is disproportionately affected by this. All of this occurring in the same month that is said to celebrate being black. Can we look in the mirror and ask ourselves if more aborted black babies is a celebration of blackness?

These incidents are vivid examples of what happens when a Democrat drives a bus full of people forward while teaching them to look back through the rear window. Democrats refuse to look ahead at the lives and potential right in front of them. They only want black people to see the death and destruction behind them and not the cliff straight ahead.

As I reflect on Black History Month, I ask whether this what black history is all about — a diversion to keep black people focusing on the past while letting the present and future slip from their grasp.

Fortunately, the month rounded out with beacons of hope — not surprisingly from the Right. President Donald Trump greeted hundreds of black attendees during a Black History Month reception at the White House. During the event, he announced that black unemployment is down to its lowest ever and that he plans to create more opportunities for people of all races.

These gestures from the Right are why so many black people are leaving the Democrat plantation. They see with clearer eyes who truly has their best interests at heart.

As Candace Owens so brilliantly stated, a virus has spread throughout black America. That virus is victimhood, as people are infected by an ideology that only programs them to embrace entitlement while the world crumbles around them. The antidote? A hearty dose of conservative American values and the true knowledge about those who have historically had our best interests at heart — the Right.

With February behind us, concerned black Americans across the political spectrum are facing a fork in the road. And it’s up to us to choose the best direction for ourselves and decide who truly is in our corner — not just during one month or holiday, but every single day, all year round."

With a simple whiff of impropriety in the throes of the #MeToo movement, seven men, both Republican and Democrat, resigned or did not seek reelection in the 2018 midterms.

Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), however, decided to run for president – the woman who cannot get her own house in order wants to reside in the big white manse at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

An investigative report by the Los Angeles Times has uncovered that Harris, through her Department of Justice, paid at least $1.1 million in cover-up money while serving six-years as California’s attorney general. And that tidy sum includes a hefty payout for a complaint against one of her closest advisors.

Harris, like Sergeant Schultz on the 70s sitcom Hogan’s Heroes, insists “I know nothing!”

But how can that be?

Allegations and Reparations

The presidential hopeful and obnoxiously vocal #MeToo proponent, when faced with the LA Times report, claimed she heard it from them first. She has since bravely attempted to shoulder the burden, though placed the blame on her sheer volume of staff: “As the chief executive of a department of nearly 5,000 employees, the buck stopped with me.”

Harris’ state Department of Justice was found to have paid settlements for an assortment of violations including demands for gay sexual acts, unwanted touching, sex chatter, and the normal claims of wage-related inequality and denied advancement.

A few of the claims would be handled by middle managers and would not reach the desk of the top cop, officials claim. But did Harris not even once take a peek at the budgets, specifically line item expenditures, for sexual harassment claims in her own department? Seems unlikely for a woman with great ambition.

One incident involved a female assistant who was asked to change the paper in the copy machine on regular occasions – part of her administrative duties. But when the boss watched her from behind as she was on hands and knees, in a skirt, performing those duties under his desk, that crossed the line. And that boss man was Harris’ longtime and very close top aide, Larry Wallace. The price tag for his indiscretions was a scant $400K.

Oh, she must have known.

Jill Telfer, an attorney who represented some of the complainants, insisted Harris should have known about the harassment issues but had a policy of looking the other way:

“The Division of Law Enforcement for the AG’s office always felt they were above the law and may have kept a lid on things. There has been a culture of retaliation against employees who raise concerns of discrimination or harassment.”

Fibbing and Feinting

Harris wants to be queen. She is aggressive in seeking the optics that suit her agenda of climbing to the top spot in political America.

Recently, she giggled that in college she smoked marijuana, and inhaled, while zoning out to “Definitely Snoop, Tupac for sure,” not realizing that neither artist had produced music while she was an undergrad at Howard University, leaving in 1986. Or when she finished her degree at Hastings College of the Law in 1989. You can bet she now has full-time researchers in all things “cool” working overtime on her staff.

If she was getting her stone on and grooving to rap in 1991, when the debut 2Pacalypse Now was released by Tupac, or in 1993 when Snoop Dogg released his first album, Doggystyle, then Harris was Deputy District Attorney in Alameda County at the time – perhaps even in the throes of her May/December romance with Willie Brown. In other words, breaking the law, moving up in state politics, and getting paid by the taxpayers of California.

Harris also took the stage recently to demand a federal anti-lynching law be enacted – which coincided with actor Jussie Smollett’s false claim of a hate crime. Smollett’s claim that white supremacists had put a noose around his neck was later debunked by Chicago Police as a hoax.

She is, if anything, an opportunist.

Harris accepted Larry Wallace’s resignation in December 2018, ending a 14-year close relationship with her top aide, and has reinforced the “no exceptions” rule in her Senate office by stating, “No office is immune to misconduct, and there is much more work to do to ensure all are protected.”

Yes, Harris wants to be the queen of the Swamp. But for now, she’ll have to reign as the princess of doublespeak, or the magistrate of not “knowing nothing,” as she attempts to reinvent her past as a progressive, tough on crime, presidential contender.

Good luck with that."

From the Kealohas, to the ongoing federal investigation of Keith Kaneshiro, to a third subpoena of the troubled Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, there is a growing sense that something is rotten in the state of Hawaii.

Common sense implores us to remember “if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging,” but the Honolulu City Council took the credibility crisis to new depths last week when it deferred Heidi Tsuneyoshi’s resolution calling for a forensic audit of HART.

Whatever the true intentions of Honolulu leadership may be, city officials appear unmoved, disinterested and sluggish in their public response to mounting accusations of wrongdoing. Yet transparent government has nothing to hide, and democratically elected leaders by definition are supposed to be responsive public servants, not stonewalls.

Cory Lum/CIvil Beat

Public perception and trust means everything in a free society such as ours. “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving just powers from the consent of the governed,” the Declaration of Independence reminds us.

Stoicism by Honolulu leadership is a bad look, and instead of coming across as authoritative or in-control, city officials look like a guilty junta covering their tracks.

Elected officials often think in terms of what will hurt or harm their re-election chances, or even their future pursuits of higher office. But there is a greater cost that society pays for non-responsive government, and it comes in the form of an erosion of trust and order. Psychologist Philip Zimbardo’s infamous Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrates that when authority figures act without restraint, those subject to authority will likewise cast off restraint.

A citizenry that perceives its government as corrupt cannot be expected to respect their fellow citizens, their government or the law. It’s time to put a stop to the cancer on our city; the buck stops at Honolulu Hale.

Face The People, Take Responsibility

Mayor Kirk Caldwell and the Honolulu City Council need to stop thinking of recent scandals as isolated and compartmentalized incidents. They may concern different matters, but they are all blemishes on the same face of our city’s competence and credibility. Before any new developments emerge, before any further questions of integrity arise, before the situation can get any more complicated, city leaders need to face the people.

Honolulu leaders need to take a leadership cue from NASA’s Eugene Kranz, who in the wake of the disastrous Apollo fire, immediately went to his staff and said, “Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up … Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, ‘Dammit, stop!'”

The city is going to need a massive jolt of peer pressure if any of us are to see credibility restored in Honolulu.

Honolulu should never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect in our government. This is not a blame that any of our elected officials can deflect to others; they alone must take responsibility for themselves and our city.

For years, the public has been shouting “Dammit, stop!” to Honolulu Hale, only to be dismissed, but now our city is embroiled in scandal. To me, that looks like Honolulu government is on the wrong side of an “I told you so.”

So how do we move forward?

To begin, Mayor Caldwell needs to arrange a joint press conference with the City Council in front of Honolulu Hale. In no uncertain terms, the mayor must declare he and his colleagues value the trust of Honolulu residents; that they are concerned about perceptions of fraud, waste, and abuse; and that all means will be taken to demonstrate the City and County of Honolulu is moving forward in the right direction.

Each council member needs to affirm the same, and commit to holding a “mother of all town halls” — type meeting where citizens can put each and every single one of them together on the spot to answer any questions or concerns about our city. The people of Honolulu need a catharsis to empty out their doubts, fears and in some cases, rage against the perceived dysfunction of our city.

Honolulu needs to see and hear that its elected officials are not crooks. Confession is good for the soul. If mistakes were made, let’s admit them and fix them. If people in positions of trust or authority failed, we need to commit to removing them. If laws were broken, justice needs to be served.

How To Get The Leadership We Deserve

The city is going to need a massive jolt of peer pressure if any of us are to see credibility restored in Honolulu. This will require every single Honolulu voter contacting their council member to demand a public statement and town hall. If we can’t make them see the light, Honolulu leadership needs to feel the fire.

Cory Lum/CIvil Beat

Hawaii’s congressional delegation also needs to play an active role in preserving the rule of law and accountable government back home. Our delegation has been quick to use the bully pulpit to engage esoteric matters ranging from Jussie Smollett to Michael Cohen, yet they are strangely mum over Honolulu’s wave of subpoenas and federal investigations.

If Attorney General Clare Connors has the sense to ask the Hawaii Supreme Court to suspend Honolulu Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro because he is the target of a federal investigation, surely our four congressional members can at the minimum co-sign a letter to Mayor Caldwell and Council Chair Ann Kobayashi expressing concern over the credibility crisis in Honolulu.

If presidential candidate Gabbard wants to drain the swamp in Washington, perhaps she should get some practice first draining the swamp in Oahu.

Honolulu residents deserve a credible, transparent government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Let’s do this."

— TOP STORY —

A day out from the Legislation Session, there are too many takes to count.

Fear not, we have the highlights. First, if it’s on John Kennedy’s radar, it should be on yours too. The revered GateHouse Capital reporter has a clean table-setter here.

Water quality and the environment will no doubt dominate the Legislative Session. Red tide, blue-green algae — you name it.

Two reporters in the areas impacted by these problems provide insight into the colorful concerns. Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports of a need for a “comprehensive approach” to the environment here. Ali Schmitz of Treasure Coast Newspapers zeros in on water quality in this piece.

Power dynamics: Here’s a look from Ana Ceballos of The News Service of Florida at how Gov. DeSantis’ administration — which boasts plenty of former lawmakers — could hold more influence than is typical over the Legislature. James Call of the Tallahassee Democrat highlights DeSantis’ political moonshot and its implications here.

Politics — it’s local: With a forthcoming House Speaker and potential Senate President behind them, Atlantic Coast regions stand to make strides, writes Mark Harper for the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Here’s a look from Carlos Medina and Joe Callahan of the Ocala Star-Banner at what lawmakers from Marion County are eyeing.

Skeptics rejoice: Tuesday will be padded with pomp and circumstance, here’s a healthy dose of cynicism to match from Sun-Sentinel columnist and veteran scribe Steve Bousquet. The Orlando Sentinel’s Gray Rohrer writes of money and its inextricable link to Session in this story. Jim Turner of The News Service of Florida points to purse string objectives and pork chasing — think ‘turkeys’ — in this project roundup.

— THE ADMINISTRATION —

“Ron DeSantis and GOP poised to redefine Florida public education” via Emily Mahoney and Jeffrey Solochek of the Tampa Bay Times — “For me, if the taxpayer is paying for the education, it’s public education,” the new Governor aid. It doesn’t matter if the money goes to a public or private school — or even to home schooling, he added. “What he proposes is a major departure from the way the state has funded public schools for generations. DeSantis wants to greatly expand state-sponsored “scholarship” programs that he says would give Florida families a wider array of schooling options. To accomplish that, hundreds of millions of dollars that now go to public schools would be diverted to private schools.

“DeSantis administration files motion to oppose exploratory drilling in Everglades” via James Varney of the Washington Times — The DeSantis administration filed a court motion opposing a state appeals court’s ruling that granted a license for exploratory drilling in Miramar, a spot in the Everglades of western Broward County. His move embarrassed the state’s Democratic Party, whose chair hours earlier had complained that DeSantis “destroyed any credibility he has on environmental issues” and continues a tradition of GOP governors afraid to embrace the green label. While DeSantis does not appear to accept the argument that global warming will soon mark the end of days, he has taken steps to protect the Sunshine State’s water supply and wild spaces, while standing up to the powerful sugar lobby.

“DeSantis meets with NYC businesses amid Amazon fallout” via Bernadette Hogan and Carl Campanile of the New York Post — After Amazon announced it was abandoning its deal to come to Queens because of vocal opposition, DeSantis swooped into the city to tell major financial firms that they won’t have such problems in his state. “Florida is a place where businesses can do well without having to face some of the political hostility that they deal with in other parts of the country. Our posture here is one of welcoming, not one of demagoguery and prejudice.” Government watchdog E.J. McMahon warned that the Amazon ordeal would be noticed by other firms: “DeSantis couldn’t have picked a better time to work on poaching New York businesses, especially high earners in finance. More than a few will no doubt find it tempting to at least listen to Florida’s pitch.”

“Attorney General rejects ‘energy choice’ petition, calls it misleading” via Samantha Gross and Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times — The proposal, put forward by the Citizens for Energy Choices political committee, calls for the customers’ “right to choose” and would loosen the grip of private utility monopolies like Florida Power & Light, Gulf Power, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric Co. It would allow customers to pick their electricity providers from a competitive market or give them more options to produce solar energy themselves. The language aims to protect customers against deceptive or unfair practices and establish an independent market to make energy sales competitive, the Alachua-based committee says. Moody described the amendment as a veiled attempt to “eliminate” the state’s investor-owned utilities, such as Florida Power & Light.

First on #FlaPol — “Nikki Fried appoints Steven Hall as general counsel” via Florida Politics — Agriculture Commissioner Fried has named attorney Hall as General Counsel for the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, according to a news release. Hall first began with the Department as a law clerk in 2005 and became Deputy General Counsel in 2017. He will serve as Chief of Staff and Chief Legal Counselor to Fried and other senior Department staff, and will lead the Office of General Counsel, including more than “20 attorneys and staff which provide legal counsel to all the Department’s 19 divisions and offices.”

— 2019 SESSION —

“José Oliva apologizes after ‘host body’ quip sparks national outrage” via Jacob Ogles at Florida Politics — House Speaker Oliva turned heads nationwide when he called pregnant women “body hosts.” The Miami Republican used the term five times in an interview with CBS Miami. “There’s a host body and that host body has to have a certain amount of rights,” Oliva said, “because at the end of the day it is that body that carries this entire other body to term.” He apologized after the term was universally panned. “I used the term ‘host’ to describe a pregnant woman,” he said. “The reaction undoubtedly shows it had the exact opposite effect.”

“Bill Galvano transportation plan teed up” via the News Service of Florida — The Senate Infrastructure and Security Committee will consider a bill (SPB 7068) that would take the initial steps toward building three major highway projects. The projects would extend the Suncoast Parkway from the Tampa Bay area to the Georgia border, extend the Florida Turnpike west to connect with the Suncoast Parkway and build a new toll road from Polk County to Collier County. Galvano argues, in part, that the projects would help boost rural economic development. The committee, chaired by former Senate President Tom Lee, will take up the measure on the first day of the Legislative Session.

“Expect a ‘very tight’ state budget, Rob Bradley says” via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics — While Florida’s reserves can weather the fiscal storm, Bradley notes that Michael (and Irma before it) “created a major cash flow issue for our state.” “We’ve spent a lot of our reserves on basic recovery efforts, and it’s taking the federal government a long time to reimburse us for their share of those costs,” Bradley said. “It’s going to be a very tight budget year.” In addition to balance sheet pressures, Bradley and other Tallahassee power players are working with a different administration than the previous budget process. Senate President Bill Galvano credited the incumbent’s team with more “collaboration” than the previous. Bradley’s take: The difference is rooted in the difference in the chief executives themselves.

“In post-Parkland Florida, lawmakers file dozens of gun bills” via Brendan Farrington of The Associated Press — About 50 gun-related bills were filed: from a Republican-sponsored repeal of gun restrictions enacted after the Parkland massacre to a Democrat-sponsored bill to ban assault rifles. Changes to the state’s gun laws will likely be somewhere in between. Republican Rep. Mike Hill understands the atmosphere, which is why he pulled his bill to repeal provisions of the last year’s school safety act that raised the minimum age to buy a rifle to 21 and created a waiting period to purchase the weapons. “It became obvious to me that the tragedy of that shooting was a wound that is still too raw to try to pull that Band-Aid off at this time. The bill wasn’t getting traction,” Hill said.

“Parkland victims compensation legislation now splitting into separate bills” via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics — A proposed victims compensation fund originally put forward in the House by Rep. Kristin Jacobs now appears to be branching into separate measures — one for family members of the deceased and another for victims who were injured. Sen. Lauren Book filed two new bills laying out the process for victims to access the funds (SB 1680, SB 1682). “It has been quite a bit to wrangle all of the different parts and components of it, but I think that we’re in a really good place with all of the different families that we’ve been working with,” Book said.

“Lawmakers load wish list for health care money” via the News Service of Florida — Speaker Oliva is pushing an ambitious goal of scaling back state health spending. But Oliva’s promises to lower health care costs have not prevented House and Senate members from requesting money for everything from hospital construction projects to increased access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction to providing care to survivors of human trafficking. Lawmakers have submitted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding requests for health care related projects. The proposals are filed for communities across the state and target programs for poor, elderly and disabled Floridians and people with substance-abuse disorders and mental-health needs. As of Monday, more than $223 million had been requested by Senators for 178 different proposals, according to a tally maintained by Senate budget staff.

“Lawmakers file bill pushing statewide election reform” via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics — Legislation (SB 1386) was filed by Sen. Jose Javier Rodriguez. Sens. Oscar Braynon II and Bobby Powell are co-sponsoring the bill. The measure would require standardized ballot design, create guidelines on notification procedures for rejected ballots and set up rules on the cure process for ballots with missing or mismatched signatures. That proposal comes after a series of complaints were lobbed at elections officials in both Broward and Palm Beach counties. “There is nothing more important to the future of our democracy than our commitment to ensuring that every vote is counted at the ballot box,” Rodríguez said.

“Republicans propose ‘fetal heartbeat’ bill to restrict abortion” via Stephen Lemongello of the Orlando Sentinel — In February, state Sen. Dennis Baxley filed a bill that would ban abortion “once a fetal heartbeat can be detected,” which doctors say usually happens six weeks after conception. “It’s the Holy Grail of the pro-life movement to overturn Roe v. Wade,” said Aubrey Jewett, a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida. “And this is starting to do that, to chip away at that ruling. A fetal heartbeat bill wouldn’t completely rule out abortion. But it would rule it out about as much as possible.” Rep. Mike Hill has sponsored a House version of the bill, and DeSantis said during the campaign he would sign a fetal heartbeat bill if it passed.

“Lawmakers are taking aim at trial lawyers. It could affect who you could sue, and how much you could win.” via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times — Lawmakers and the insurance industry are pushing an array of bills that would cap damages for reimbursements for pain and suffering in lawsuits, impose restrictions on product lawsuits in which the product was “unreasonably misused,” and force homeowners into lengthy appraisal processes before suing insurance companies. Lawmakers and tort reform advocates say that cracking down on frivolous lawsuits will lower insurance rates for homeowners, doctors and businesses, an oft-used defense for their annual push to limit damages. “Being the ‘judicial hellhole’ that we are has caused every person’s rates go up,” state Rep. Tom Leek referring to the annual state rankings.

“Ready to rumble? Alimony reform bill filed for 2019” via Florida Politics — Lawmakers could again wrestle with alimony reform this year as the issue’s first bill — including a provision to end “permanent alimony” — was filed Friday. First-term Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Stuart Republican, is sponsoring the 28-page measure (SB 1596) … Efforts to overhaul alimony law, mostly by toughening the standards by which alimony is granted and changed, have failed in the last few years. But, if alimony bills move this Session, it could again spark one of the most contentious policy battles the Capitol has seen in recent memory.

“Lawmaker takes aim at constitutional challenges” via the News Service of Florida — Sen. Kelli Stargel filed a bill (SB 1630) that would lead to the Florida Supreme Court using a “blind, random selection process” to assign constitutional challenges to circuit courts across the state. Currently, the cases are filed in Leon County, which is home to the Capitol. But under the proposal, Leon County circuit judges would only hear the cases if assigned through the random selection process. “It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that a single trial court does not effectively have a monopoly over cases raising issues of statewide, constitutional importance,” said the bill.

“Bill seeks out Dozier school abuse survivors” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — State Sen. Darryl Rouson believes it important to find every living survivor of abuse there. The Arthur G. Dozier School and Okeechobee School Abuse Victim Certification Act (SB 1374) demands the state seek out living victims. That list includes anyone subjected to physical, mental or sexual abuse while at Florida Reform schools from the 1940s through ’70s. “The identification process is a crucial part of helping those affected by the atrocities that occurred at Florida’s Dozier School for Boys,” Rouson said. “It will allow us to ensure that those who endured the mental and physical anguish of attending Dozier are duly compensated for the harm inflicted upon them by the state of Florida.”

“Lori Berman, Tina Polsky want more trust behind Sadowski dollars” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — State Rep. Polsky, a Boca Raton Democrat, filed legislation (HB 353) requiring repayment of trust dollars not spent on affordable housing. “I believe the funds should be reimbursed if swept so that desperately-needed affordable housing in all of Florida, and specifically in areas of urgent need, remain a priority in the budget,” Polsky said. State Sen. Berman, who filed companion legislation (SB 1504) in the Senate, said working families need this spending properly used. “The creation of affordable housing in our state is imperative for the success of Florida’s working families,” she said.

What Dean Ridings is reading — “Legislation could end newspapers’ monopoly on running legal notices” via Florida Politics — A proposed bill for the 2019 Session would shut out the state’s newspapers from the lucrative public legal notices market. The 41-page bill would repeal requirements now in state law essentially giving newspapers a monopoly by requiring meeting notices and other legal notices, for example, to be advertised in print. “When the public notice law was established, print newspapers were the dominant communications vehicle for our citizens,” Fine said in a statement. “With the advent of the internet and smartphones and the dramatic declines in print circulation, that is no longer the case.”

Ed Hooper, Jennifer Webb file swimming pool safety legislation — Sen. Hooper, a Clearwater Republican, and Rep. Webb, a St. Petersburg Democrat, filed companion bills on residential swimming pool safety, to be known as the “Kacen’s Cause Act.” SB 724 and HB 805 are in honor of a two-year-old who fatally drowned in his family’s swimming pool. Currently, to pass a residential swimming pool inspection, a swimming pool must possess at least one of five specified pool safety features. This legislation will require that two of the five specified safety features are met to pass a residential swimming pool inspection and receive a certificate of completion.

What Ryan Wiggins is reading — “Will Blue Angels emblazon Florida license plates?” via Jacob ogles of Florida Politics — State Sen. Doug Broxson filed legislation (SB 1686) to make a specialty license plate for the beloved flyers. The U.S. Navy flight demonstration team operates in Pensacola but performs air shows across the country. Staff at the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles will design the license plate. The only requirements are for the words “Florida” at the top and “Home of the Blue Angels” on the bottom.

First in Sunburn — “New AFP-FL campaign seeks education scholarship accounts for all” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — A new television and digital ad from the group cuts together quotes from political leaders. The first featured are former Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Democratic President Barack Obama, both minority voices. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has continued involvement in the school reform movement, also appears. The video spot closes with an ask for viewers to contact lawmakers and support creating more scholarships. “We’re committed to working with anyone who believes that the status quo in education can be improved and that your ZIP code and income shouldn’t determine your educational outcomes,” said AFP-FL State Director Skylar Zander. The campaign comes as school choice advocates celebrate the arrival of an administration voicing support for such vouchers.

“Florida teachers to school lawmakers on need to ‘fund our future’” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — As the Florida Education Association holds its Day of Action, expect calls to fund neighborhood public schools. “We are united in delivering one message,” said FEA President Fedrick Ingram. “State leaders must fund our future. They must invest in neighborhood public schools, invest in the success of our students, and invest in the teachers and staff who work in our schools.” The messaging comes as Florida’s state teachers’ union launches its Fund Our Future campaign. New advertisements stress the need to fund arts education, keep classrooms small and provide for school safety. The group also notes a teacher shortage. The Florida Department of Education released a report verifying a lack of certified science, English and math instructors.

— MORE SESSION —

Senate to consider massive education bill Wednesday — The Senate Committee on Education will consider a significant education bill (SPB 7070) when it meets Wednesday. As reported by Andrew Atterbury of POLITICO Florida, the bill contains provisions to expand state-funded scholarships for students to attend private schools, a program that would award the 45,000 “most effective” public school teachers up to $9,000 in bonuses, and a “Family Empowerment Scholarship” for 15,000 students. That provision mirrors Gov. DeSantis’ pitch for an “Equal Opportunity Scholarship” that would use up to $100 million in FEFP funding to clear the 14,000-student waitlist for current scholarship programs. A recent poll from ExcelinEd, a group founded by former Gov. Bush, recently found three-quarters of Florida voters were in favor of expanding the state’s tax credit scholarship programs.

“Crystal Ball: Florida a swing state no more” via Jacob Ogles at Florida Politics — Is Florida’s reputation as America’s biggest swing state over? Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a lead election prognosticator, believes so. The University of Virginia political forecasting team on Thursday released its first electoral projections for the 2020 presidential election. The biggest shock may be Florida’s debut in the “Leans Republican” column. Managing Editor Kyle Kondik acknowledges the move will prove controversial. But ultimately, Republicans win most of the close elections here. U.S. Sen Rick Scott’s victory in November, however narrow, caught the Crystal Ball team’s attention.

Hurricane Michael proving costly to state’s budget writers — The state has dipped into its reserves to the tune of nearly $292 million — largely to pay for Hurricane Michael recovery — so legislators writing the budget for the next fiscal year will start that deep in the hole. The Legislature typically rolls over unspent reserves into a subsequent year’s budget. Economists for the Legislature and Governor’s Office have yet to nail down a forecast for tax receipts for the 2018-19 fiscal year. “You know, reserves are for emergencies,” chief legislative forecaster Amy Baker said. “Hurricane Michael was an emergency.” Find the data here.

Great read — “As regulators and feds closed in, an insurer’s lobbyist helped rewrite state law” via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida — An insurance lobbyist last year persuaded Florida legislators to pass a law to help a deep-pocketed Republican donor under scrutiny from regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice. The measure was approved by the Legislature and signed into law by former Gov. Scott in April 2018, as Greg Lindberg, a wealthy insurance entrepreneur, was under federal investigation and facing regulatory scrutiny in several states. Lindberg had been on the radar of Florida regulators since at least 2016, when the state Office of Insurance declared one of his businesses, Southland National Insurance Corp., “financially impaired.” The company had overstated its assets by $165 million in part by improperly valuing subsidiary investments beyond what a state accounting statute allowed.

DBPR ordered to pay ‘blunt wrap’ maker’s legal fees — An administrative law judge ordered the state to pay a Broward County “blunt wrap” manufacturer $150,000 for its attorneys’ fees and costs. The decision came after an appellate court last year found the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) failed to properly go through rule-making before deciding certain types of tobacco wraps can be taxed as tobacco products. Grabba-Leaf LLC challenged the department over a memorandum that said “whole leaf” tobacco wraps would be taxed as tobacco products. That came after another court said a different type of wrap was not taxable. The 1st District Court of Appeal later agreed with Grabba-Leaf that DBPR should have gone through a rule-making process instead of simply issuing a memorandum.

“MCM, the contractor behind FIU bridge that collapsed, files for bankruptcy protection” via Douglas Hanks of the Miami Herald — Munilla Construction Management, the Miami-based contractor, said in a news release it would ask a federal judge for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, which allows companies to negotiate with creditors while reorganizing with hopes of resuming normal business operations. The process should take about four months, an MCM spokesman said. The family-owned company won the bid from FIU to build a pedestrian bridge over Southwest Eighth Street, and the partially finished structure collapsed on March 15, killing six people. In the release, MCM suggested it plans to negotiate all claims against the company — including those stemming from the bridge collapse — during the bankruptcy proceedings.

“Bonds for Virgin Trains inch closer to reality” via Florida Politics — Virgin Trains USA, formerly known as Brightline, held a public hearing Friday in Tallahassee in its quest to bond nearly $1 billion to build its high-speed rail service, eventually to run all the way from West Palm Beach through Orlando to Tampa. The proposal was met with near universal approval from elected officials, interest groups and others in attendance … The entity had planned to expand its high-speed rail service, already operating in South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Orlando by late 2021 and then eventually from Orlando to Tampa.

“FSU, Maura’s Voice launch research exploring the ‘intersection of hate and violence’” via Byron Dobson of the Tallahassee Democrat — On Monday, a newly established research initiative housed at Florida State University will be announced by President John Thrasher and Jeff Binkley, whose daughter, Maura, a student at FSU, was killed at Hot Yoga, along with faculty member, Dr. Nancy Van Vessem. Binkley and his wife, Margaret Binkley, are the driving forces behind Maura’s Voice, a think tank focusing on research designed to break down barriers and address violence in our culture. Among the areas to be examined include violence against women, the relationship between hate speech and violent behavior, the role of gun safety policy with violence, stalking behavior and the role of social media and the internet tied to gun violence.

“The men fighting Florida’s python epidemic” via John-Paul Flintoff of The Economist — Dusty “Wildman” Crum and Mike “Cowboy” Kimmel are participants in the Python Elimination Program of the South Florida Water Management District. They work as bounty hunters in the Everglades, a sultry wilderness that covers the southernmost reaches of the Sunshine State and are paid to catch and kill as many Burmese pythons as they can find. But laying their hands on fast-moving, highly dangerous, camouflaged reptiles in a swamp that extends for thousands of square miles is about as easy as it sounds. No one knows precisely how many pythons inhabit the Everglades. The authorities estimate that there are around 100,000, but there could be more. And no one can offer a clear explanation of how they got there.

Spotted — Democratic former CFO Alex Sink in “‘Mobituaries’: Chang and Eng Bunker, the original Siamese twins” via CBS Sunday Morning — If the names Chang and Eng Bunker don’t ring a bell, they are the famous conjoined brothers who were the original Siamese twins. You might have heard of them, or seen their picture, but their story is much more than a medical case study … “I think it’s an incredible, inspiring American immigration story,” Sink said of her forebear, Chang Bunker. “America was always the beacon of the place where somebody could come and build a successful life, and they came here with nothing.”

— THE SHADOW PRESIDENT —

As the Florida House pursues its investigation of misspent money at the University of Central Florida, that school’s legendary, longtime leader — President Emeritus John C. Hitt — has become little more than a shadow.

Scott Powers, our Orlando correspondent, says of his story, “I got obsessed reading the depositions into the scandal … it occurred to me there was a big story no one had yet tried to tell.”

The backstory: The 78-year-old Hitt retired as UCF president last June after leading the school for 26 years, building it “from a sleepy commuter college to one of the nation’s largest and foremost metropolitan research universities.”

The revelation: But his legacy may be at risk now that investigations are ongoing into university officials’ financial decisions in his last five years in office.

The blowback: “In the eyes of state officials, those actions involved illegally moving money around for otherwise unfunded projects, starting with the replacement of an aging, mold-sick Trevor Colbourn Hall on campus,” Powers writes.

The aftermath: It’s a story, then, of a momentous failing at UCF, and what role Hitt played.

“After Amendment 4, thousands registered in Duval County. Now, will they vote?” via Andrew Pantazi of the Florida Times-Union — In the 43 days since the change, the rate of new registrations doubled, with nearly 3,700 Duval County residents registering. The new voters were older, more likely to be non-white, to be men and to be Democrats. The March 19 elections for mayor, sheriff and city council will present one of the first opportunities any of the state’s recently enfranchised voters have to exercise their new rights. Already some local elections were held last month in Miami-Dade County. What impact Amendment 4, which voters approved with 64.5 percent of the vote, will have on Jacksonville’s election remains a mystery, especially since so many of the new voters are Democrats and no Democrat filed to run against Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry.

Ousted superintendent takes case to Supreme Court via MyPanhandle.com — Okaloosa Superintendent Mary Beth Jackson is asking the Florida Supreme Court to reinstate her after DeSantis suspended her from office. Her argument in an emergency petition rests on the language of the law which treats her current term separate from her previous term in office. Since the allegations against her all happened before she was re-elected Jackson is arguing that DeSantis overstepped his authority by removing her from office. Jackson was re-elected in November of 2016. But, in one of his first acts as the newly elected governor, DeSantis removed her from office. “Gov. DeSantis is without authority to suspend Superintendent Jackson for actions preceding the current term of office,” wrote George Levesque, Jackson’s attorney.

“Racial rift emerges over Parkland shooting and Superintendent Robert Runcie” via Megan O’Matz and Scott Travis of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — The movement for accountability after the 2018 Parkland massacre has focused on ousting the highly educated, hardworking, Jamaican-born schools chief, many in Broward County’s African-American community are saying no. Stop. Enough. Word spread in black churches, across neighborhoods, and through social media: Come to a town hall meeting on security issues and make your support known for Runcie. An email from a school district department head went out urging attendance and accusing Runcie’s detractors of using “vile language” not seen “since desegregation orders were

“6 positions on St. Johns water board could change” via Dinah Voyles Pulver of the Daytona Beach News-Journal — However the board changes, it ought to include a greater diversity of viewpoints and greater advocacy for environmental issues, several officials and others said. Barring any decision by the governor to ask for the resignations of all board members, as he did with the South Florida district’s board, DeSantis could appoint as many as six new members to the nine-member board over the next few weeks. Last week, the governor rescinded the appointments of three board members who had not yet been confirmed by the Florida Senate, including controversial chairman John Miklos. The other two were Allan Roberts and Janet Price. The terms of three other board members expire this month: Ron Howse, Fred Roberts and Chuck Drake.

“FEMA gives Naples millions for Irma, but ‘hoops’ remain” via Lisa Conley of the Naples Daily News — The City of Naples is set to receive its first reimbursement for the millions of dollars it spent recovering from Hurricane Irma. The city submitted 27 Irma-related projects totaling $9.2 million to FEMA for reimbursement. Of that $9.2 million FEMA has obligated — meaning it is already given the funds to the state — $2.3 million, approved an additional $4.1 million and $700,000 is in the FEMA final review stage. However, just because FEMA has obligated or approve the money doesn’t mean Naples will receive the money anytime soon; FEMA doesn’t cut reimbursement checks directly to local governments. Instead, he gives the money to the state emergency response team which serves as a pass-through.

“Collier Enterprises plans 1,000-acre development in eastern Collier” via Patrick Riley of the Naples Daily News — The company filed a proposal to the county to create a 1,000-acre village, called Rivergrass Village, north and south of Oil Well Road, just east of Desoto Boulevard. Rivergrass would allow for up to 2,500 homes, a minimum of 62,500 square feet and a maximum of 80,000 square feet of “neighborhood-scaled retail and office uses,” and a minimum of 25,000 square feet of civic, government, and institutional uses, according to a project narrative. The community would also feature an 18-hole golf course on 150 acres and a 20-acre mixed-use village center on the south side of Oil Well Road.

“Marco Rubio wants info declassified on China’s 5G capabilities” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — Specifically, the Senators want the report to explain China’s participation in international standard-setting bodies regarding telecommunications. Both Senators serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and said anecdotal evidence suggests China exerts undue political influence on ISSBs. That’s especially important as concerns circulate about Chinese companies allowing the government to spy on parties around the world. The Florida Republican and Virginia Democrat wrote a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats urging he publish information.

“Dems try to turn up heat on Alex Acosta over sex abuse plea deal” via Kathryn Lucey of The Associated Press — A group of House Democrats sent a letter to the attorney general asking the Justice Department to reopen the deal with Jeffrey Epstein to allow further investigation. They also want the department to make public the results of a department review into federal prosecutors’ management of the case, which happened when Acosta served as U.S. Attorney in Miami. “It is at this critical juncture that the agency has an opportunity to foster greater transparency and accountability with the American public,” says the letter, led by Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Lois Frankel and signed by other Democrats.

“Judge orders Roger Stone to explain imminent release of book that may violate gag order” via Spencer Hsu and Manuel Roig-Franzia via The Washington Post — The order by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson came barely eight days after Jackson barred Stone from speaking publicly about his case. Jackson said in imposing the gag order that it would be “foolhardy” to wait for him to transgress again, that she had “serious doubts whether you’ve learned any lesson at all,” and warned she would order him to jail for future violations. Jackson also ordered Stone’s attorneys to explain by Monday why they waited until now in making that request to disclose the “imminent general release” of a book, which Jackson said he “was known to the defendant.”

“Francis Rooney leads delegation in warding off oil rigs” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — U.S. Rep. Rooney wrote a letter to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt demanding oil rigs stay away from Florida waters. And all 27 House members in the Florida Congressional delegation signed onto the message. “Our beaches drive Florida’s more than $100 billion in tourism revenue,” Rooney wrote. Bernhardt previously worked for lobbying firm Brownstein, Hyatt and Farber, where he lobbied on behalf of Delta Petroleum Corp. for an expansion in offshore oil drilling.

“Vern Buchanan calls his vote for gun background checks ‘a no-brainer’” via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune — During the 2018 election, Buchanan said he supported expanding background checks to include more gun buyers. He followed through on that pledge last week, voting for H.R. 8, which requires background checks on buyers who purchases weapons over the internet or at gun shows. Conservative former Sarasota County School Board member Frank Kovach wrote on Facebook that he “didn’t see that coming from Vern. Extremely disappointing.” Meanwhile, Democratic state Rep. Margaret Good wrote on Facebook that she is “thrilled Congressman Buchanan agrees with me and over 90% of Floridians that background checks should be a requirement for gun purchasers.” Good filed a similar background check bill for the upcoming Legislative Session.

“Secure borders or process — Democrats, Congress need to decide what really matters” via Rick Scott for Fox News — First, Washington is completely dysfunctional; nothing works properly here. Second, the Democrat Party is against border security. They say they’re for it, but they don’t do it. So, all Senators and Congressmen have to decide — which is more important? Their long-held views regarding the proper processes by which decisions are made in Washington? Or, their desire for America to have secure borders? I can’t see how this is a hard decision to make. What is more important? The process? Or the policy? I believe that securing our border is far more important than process arguments in Washington. I’ve noticed in my short time here, there is actually more time spent fussing about process than about actual policies that will affect Americans. It’s bizarre.

“DeSantis sends strong message on environment” via the Tampa Bay Times editorial board — The $91 billion state budget proposed by DeSantis includes nearly $1.9 billion for environmental protection, some $90 million more over the current year. These are big, strategic investments in protecting water quality, public health and business and property values. The new Governor has laid out compelling priorities, put a dollar figure to them and set a spending bar that he hopes to meet by the end of his first four-year term. In that sense, DeSantis has signaled he intends to bring a new level of certainty to environmental funding. These commitments would help Florida leverage matching federal dollars and help put Everglades restoration on a more timely track. It’s up to the Florida Legislature to follow through.

“Susana Martinez to join board of Jeb Bush’s ed reform group” via The Associated Press — Bush, the founder and chairman for the Foundation for Excellence in Education, said that former New Mexico Gov. Martinez will become a member of the group’s board of directors and help push reforms in other states. Bush called Martinez a “visionary leader” who adopted strong education reforms as governor from 2011 to 2018. But her appointment comes as the Democratic-controlled New Mexico Legislature is set to vote on far-reaching reforms to the state’s public education system, reversing many of the policies under Martinez.

“Former DEM director opens disaster consulting shop” via Arek Sarkissian of POLITICO Florida — Wes Maul resigned as Division of Emergency Management director on Jan. 9 with the inauguration of Gov. DeSantis. Two weeks later, he sent an email offering his services to Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, advertising his expertise with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The former emergency director drew fire after Hurricanes Hermine, Matthew, Irma and Michael tore across the state over the past two years. Cash-strapped localities found themselves desperate for resources in part because of a DEM audit policy instituted by Maul that had drastically slowed the flow of aid. More than two months after Irma, the state agency had distributed less than 17 percent of the $303 million in Irma funds approved by FEMA.

""If they want our dollars and we give them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people to speak,"" said Trump in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

He did not describe how the executive order would work, or who would judge whether a college or university was not protecting free speech.

During his speech, President Trump brought on stage and praised Hayden Williams, who was punched last week when he was at the University of California, Berkeley, seeking support for the president and conservative causes and criticizing Jussie Smollett, the actor who is facing charges of false reporting to the police in a hate crime he claimed to have experienced.

Of Williams, President Trump said that he should sue Berkeley ""and maybe sue the state."" To loud applause, Trump said, ""He took a hard punch in the face for all of us. We can never allow that to happen."" And he added that after Williams sues Berkeley, ""he's going to be a very wealthy man."" The crowd at the meeting chanted ""USA"" as Trump made these statements.

Video has widely circulated showing Williams being punched.

Trump did not note that Berkeley arrested a man, Zachary Greenberg, for assaulting Williams. Neither Williams nor Greenberg are students at Berkeley. The university had permitted Williams to be on campus expressing his views.

Late Saturday, Berkeley released a new summary of what had happened, reiterating that the university had in this incident not wavered in its commitment to free speech or its willingness to take action in response to the attack on Williams. The statement said that events at the university have been ""willfully distorted and inaccurately reported.""

This is not the first time President Trump has used an incident at Berkeley to suggest that federal research dollars should be cut off over alleged denial of free speech rights.

In 2017, violent protesters (believed by university officials to be from off campus) set fires and damaged property at the university just before a scheduled appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos. President Trump tweeted:

If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

What he didn't note at that time was that Berkeley officials had allowed Yiannopoulos to speak, calling off the event only amid the violence. Berkeley had defended his right to appear on campus (and he has appeared since), citing principles of free speech even as some on campus said he should be kept away because of views many find offensive.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, in an interview shortly after President Trump's Saturday speech, called the proposed executive order ""a solution in search of a problem."" He said that is because ""free speech and academic freedom are core values of research universities.""

While ""controversies do arise,"" Hartle said that the norm is for universities to err on the side of promoting free speech. He asked how some federal agency in the future would try to enforce the executive order by determining whether a college had done enough to promote free speech. He predicted that an executive order would lead people to try to create free speech incidents just to stir up controversy.

And Hartle said that federal law gives religious institutions broad discretion about campus activities. ""Would religious institutions be required to have speakers whose views were antithetical to the college?"" Hartle asked. ""Would Yeshiva University be required to host a Holocaust denier?""

Hartle also noted the lack of consistency of the Trump administration about free speech.

""As always in the current environment, irony does come into play. This is an administration that stifles the views of its own research scientists if they are counter to the political views of the administration, such as on climate change. And the president vigorously attacks people like Colin Kaepernick who exercise their free speech rights.""

Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said via email, “Public research universities have a First Amendment constitutional obligation to protect free speech. It is an obligation they take very seriously and work hard to protect. Our campuses serve as important forums for the debate of diverse ideas. An executive order is unnecessary, as public research universities are already bound by the First Amendment, which they deeply respect and honor. It is core to their academic mission.”

The Trump Administration Record

Before he was president, Trump called for the National Endowment for the Arts to stop supporting, and for museums to stop displaying art he considers to be ""gross, degenerate stuff."" And while he has been president, his staff has taken actions -- such as blocking critics from the Trump Twitter feed -- that have led to the administration being sued over First Amendment concerns.

Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave several speeches denouncing the squelching of speech on college campuses. But Sessions was silent about (and declined to answer questions on) squelching that was done at the behest of Republican politicians, such as when the University of Kansas took down an artwork featuring the American flag after GOP leaders in the state demanded that it come down.

The Trump administration's officials talk regularly about Berkeley. The administration has been silent as Republican legislators in Tennessee have for years tried to kill a student-organized ""Sex Week"" at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville -- an event that does not use state funds.

Views of Groups That Focus on Free Expression

Among organizations that promote free expression on campus, the response to President Trump's Saturday speech was tepid.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released a statement that said in part, ""While we are glad that this important national issue has the president’s attention, we do not currently have any more information on the details of the executive order. We are looking forward to learning more about this initiative in the coming days.""

Jonathan Friedman, project director for campus free speech at PEN America, said via email, ""We need to see the text. On the surface the government reaffirming the importance of free speech on campus is appropriate and essential, particularly at a time of serious threats to open discourse. In practice, new and proposed measures ostensibly intended to protect speech can yield unintended negative consequences for speech, which we've documented in our work. While we at PEN America reserve judgment until a draft of the order is released, we believe that any government action on this issue should be approached in a thoughtful, nonpartisan manner, upholding the universal principles of free speech and academic freedom.""

Debra Mashek, executive director of Heterodox Academy, said via email that ""we need diversity and dialogue, not decrees.""

Added Mashek, “Heterodox Academy encourages individual colleges and universities to advance common-sense policies and practices that promote teaching, learning and discovery. Higher ed would not benefit from a blunt, top-down, partisan decree that politicizes the academy’s core values of open inquiry and academic freedom. Governments cannot legislate campus cultures. In order to create classrooms and campuses that welcome diverse people with diverse viewpoints and that equip learners with the habits of heart and mind to engage that diversity in open inquiry and constructive disagreement, colleges and universities must harness their own values, histories and capacities.”

Could Solomon Amendment Be a Model?

Many in higher education questioned how the executive order might work. Two proponents of the measure, however, say that the Solomon Amendment provides a model.

In an article in National Affairs last year, Frederick M. Hess and Grant Addison, both of the American Enterprise Institute, called for federal funds to be cut off to American colleges that do not support free expression on campus. They said that the precedent for this could be the Solomon Amendment, the 1996 law that barred federal funds from going to colleges and universities that did not permit military recruiting or Reserve Officer Training Corps programs on campus. The law came at a time when some colleges were barring the military from campus, citing its policies (since lifted) of discriminating against gay people. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 upheld the constitutionality of the amendment, which was challenged by law schools.

While there was no dispute that some colleges barred the military, in the case of free expression, some institutions (such as Berkeley) denounced by President Trump can point to evidence that they in fact support free expression.

""New federal guidance in this area has a chance to make free inquiry and free speech relevant to the broader scientific research community in a fashion that it has not been previously,"" says the article. ""The slumbering, silent middle on campus may awaken when accomplished researchers bringing in millions in 'indirect' costs suddenly recognize that the ideological crusades of their colleagues may imperil their laboratories and research projects. Campus leaders who have found it easy to virtue signal by indulging students and faculty demanding constraints on speech will now have a fairer fight on their hands, and they will need to be worried about their biochemistry and engineering faculty departing for institutions eligible for federal funds."""

Although, my late wife generally saw eye to eye with me when it came to politics, the one issue we could never agree on was term limits.

Apparently, judging by a lot of the email I receive, many among you agree with her that the limits would be at least a partial solution to the problems heaped on us by the political class.

One of the problems is that for the corruption, cowardice and incompetence of the many, the few would suffer. After all, even someone as cynical as I am when it comes to politicians have to acknowledge that there are some who appear to be doing a good job. Which is to say, I agree with them.

Another problem with term limits is that politicians are generally interchangeable, so kicking one out is generally just going to result in replacing him or her with someone equally obnoxious.

The Islamic enclaves in Michigan and Minnesota will continue to elect the likes of Keith Ellison, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, just as the folks in the Bronx will keep sending their own rock star A O-C back to the House for the next 50 years unless she decides to run for the Senate or the presidency.

The problem, as I kept trying to explain to Yvonne, is that the politicians aren’t really the problem; the voters are. They’re the ones who should have term limits.

It’s probably a good thing that our Founding Fathers aren’t around to see what a hash we’ve made of their remarkable experiment in self-government.

Thomas Jefferson, about whom our young people know precious little aside from the fact that he owned slaves and slept with one of them, opined that: “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

That was then, this is now. Considering the state of our government and the equally rancid state of our newspapers, I think even Jefferson would have thrown his arms up in disgust and said: “Skip it. I’m sorry I opened my mouth.”

One of my least favorite politicians when I was growing up was Earl Warren, who went from being California’s governor, where he oversaw the incarceration of American citizens of Japanese descent, to being the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, where he led his colleagues in evicting God and the reading of the Bible from our public school, by intentionally misinterpreting the First Amendment, so that instead of merely ensuring that the United States would never become a theocracy, the Court pretended that the words “separation of church and state” actually appear in the Constitution.

It’s like the Court’s pretending that the 14th Amendment, written to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves, extends to the babies of illegal aliens who have no right to be on American soil.

Somewhere along the way, the Courts went from deciding that certain minority groups are not merely entitled to equal rights, but to certain rights not granted to others.

I believe that most people think that every American is entitled to his say in how things are run, but balk at the notion that just because someone is a member of a designated victims group, he or she gets the final say.

In 1963, when the Warren Court, in the Abington School District v. Schempp case, banned Bible reading in school, only Justice Potter Stewart stood up for reason, stating in a dissenting opinion; “It led not to true neutrality with respect to religion, but to the establishment of a religion of secularism.”

And since then, things have only grown worse in our schools. Between teachers’ colleges churning out second-rate robots spouting leftist propaganda; a federal government curriculum, Common Core, that promotes the U.N. and globalism, while stiffing the kids when it comes to reading, writing, arithmetic and reasoning; and the feds extorting schools by withholding funds if they dare rebel against the restrictions; we have a public education system that has been carefully devised by the likes of the Rockefeller Foundation and George Soros to turn out sheep, 58% of whom are convinced that Socialism is the answer to their prayers. Their secular prayers, that is.

Along with all his other sins, Jimmy Carter created the U.S. Department of Education. As was the case in every evil regime of the 20th century, American liberals understood that gaining control of a nation is only part one; in order to retain control of a nation, one must control both the military and the schools. In the U.S., the military might still be up for grabs, but the Communists definitely have a stranglehold on the education system, and not just K through the 12th grade, but all the way through grad school.

One of the lies perpetrated by FDR and Governor Warren was that the internment camps were created to provide safety for Japanese-Americans. While it would be unfair to call them concentration camps inasmuch as the prisoners weren’t gassed in ovens, experimented upon by an American Dr. Mengele or worked to death in coal mines, it would also be unfair to pretend that the camps were intended to protect those locked behind the barbed wire and the guard towers.

As one of the prisoners later remarked, “If they were supposed to protect us, why is it that the guns were pointed at us and not in the opposite direction?”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may be too young to run for President of the United States, but she should consider running for the presidency of Mexico. After all, she is only the second person I ever heard compare a wall at our southern border to the Berlin Wall. The first dope I heard who seemed confused as to the difference between a wall built of keep citizens in and one built to keep non-citizens out was the ex-president of Mexico, Vicente Fox.

It’s not as if Chicago doesn’t already have more problems than it can handle, what with a nincompoop like Rahm Emanuel as its mayor, 3,000 shootings in 2018 and a murder solve rate of just 16%, now actor Jussie Smollett has come along to further embarrass the Windy City.

Although I had never heard of the guy or watched a show he’s on called “Empire,” he became famous overnight when he alleged he had been beaten up by two white guys, calling him names referencing his race (black) and his sexual identity (homosexual), and shouting “This is MAGA country!”

It smelled fishy from the start. Two white guys in a city that has a huge black population that went over 80% for Hillary Clinton announcing it to be MAGA country?!

But that didn’t stop the usual suspects — Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris — from racing to his defense. Sen, Harris, quite predictably, called it “a modern-day lynching.”

I’ve thought about it, and what I’ve concluded is that a modern-day lynching is one where not only is nobody hanged, but is, instead, one where a black gay actor gets two friends to rough him up while shouting their support for President Trump just so Mr. Smollett could garner himself sympathy and nation-wide publicity.

I know that most actors hanker to direct, but if this is an example of his work, Smollett would be well-advised not to give up his day job."

Looking ahead: Once the sensationalism of the raid on the Orchids of Asia Spa passes, and the list of ""johns"" is published, the real work of law enforcement begins. How to differentiate between prostitutes (defendants) and those who were tricked into participating (victims). Where does the money trail lead to and how can local law enforcement track it and claim it. How to enforce Florida law beyond our borders to bring to justice the real ""monsters"" of this modern-day slavery. Human trafficking is a crime that has morphed into a multi-national global business using high tech to further its aims. To protect, not just the brand of our beautiful state but especially our people from this scourge, our laws must keep pace. Our legislators must give us the tools to catch, prosecute and punish those who dare to come to Florida with these evil intentions.

Last week: There are some statistics that we, as Floridians should be proud of, for example, we now rank number 3 in population for the country. There is another statistic that is embarrassing, we also rank number 3 in the country for human trafficking. The raids on massage parlors in Martin and Palm Beach Counties were shocking, not just for Who were frequenting them, but for Where they were located. Hard to believe that the beautiful palm beaches could harbor such ""evil within"" an innocent strip mall. As the founder of a foundation dedicated to raising awareness about this modern day slavery, I urge everyone to be knowledgeable of the signs of human trafficking and to notify the authorities. This is our problem and we must be part of the solution."

As she was promoting The Umbrella Academy, a “fired up” Page appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and blamed Mike Pence‘s policies for contributing to the normalization of homophobia that leads to hate crimes like the one that Smollett’s been accused by law enforcement of staging.

Following the unraveling of Smollett’s story over the past month, Page is now breaking her silence by penning a Hollywood Reporter column. It’s a lengthy piece in which she doesn’t dwell long on the investigation at hand but speaks to the damaging effects if Smollett’s attack was in fact faked. “[I]t could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes,” Page writes. “Very real crimes.” She continues while imploring the public to never lose sight of the conversation about hate crimes:

While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day. I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.

Page points toward grim statistics to support her argument:

Hatred toward otherized people is institutionalized here and across the globe and reinforced by political rhetoric. FBI data released in 2018 shows reported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent the year prior, the third consecutive year of escalation. In fact, the most recent study from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ+ community. The statistics are plentiful and powerful and all point to a rising tide of hate violence.

The full column is well worth reading and can be found here. The Hollywood Reporter has also published an extensive profile of the now-suspended Empire actor that digs into his internal struggles, including depression, while exploring whether or not the pressures of fame contributed to his disintegrating situation. See the publication’s cover below.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s team maintains that they have evidence (including the $3,500 check that many consider to be a smoking gun) will actually disprove claims of a staged attack. His next Chicago court date will be on March 14.

41,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/opinion/violence-criminal-justice.html,2019-03-03 00:00:00,Opinion | Reckoning With Violence,['Michelle Alexander'],https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/opinion/03alexander/03alexander-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg,"['justice', 'opinion', 'person', 'victims', 'sered', 'violence', 'restorative', 'survivors', 'choose', 'reckoning', 'theyre', 'incarceration']","Survivors themselves know this. That’s why fully 90 percent of survivors in New York City, when given the chance to choose whether they want the person who harmed them incarcerated or in a restorative justice process — one that offers support to survivors while empowering them to help decide how perpetrators of violence can repair the damage they’ve done — choose the latter and opt to use the services of Ms. Sered’s nonprofit organization , Common Justice.

Ms. Sered launched Common Justice in an effort to give survivors of violence — like herself — a meaningful pathway to accountability without perpetuating the harms endemic to mass incarceration. As a restorative justice program, it offers a survivor-centered accountability process that “gives those directly impacted by acts of violence the opportunity to shape what repair will look like, and, in the case of the responsible party, to carry out that repair instead of going to prison.” The people who choose to participate are victims of serious violent felonies — people who have been shot, stabbed or robbed — and who decide that they would prefer to get answers from the person who harmed them, be heard in a restorative justice circle, help to devise an accountability plan, and receive comprehensive victim services, rather than send the person who harmed them to prison.

Ninety percent is a stunning figure considering everything we’ve been led to believe that survivors actually want. For years, we’ve been told that victims of violence want nothing more than for the people who hurt them to be locked up and treated harshly. It is true that some survivors do want revenge or retribution, especially in the immediate aftermath of the crime. Ms. Sered is emphatic that rage is not pathological and a desire for revenge is not blameworthy; both are normal and can be important to the healing process, much as denial and anger are normal stages of grief.

But she also stresses that the number of people who are interested only in revenge or punishment is greatly exaggerated. After all, survivors are almost never offered real choices. Usually when we ask victims “Do you want incarceration?” what we’re really asking is “Do you want something or nothing?” And when any of us are hurt, and when our families and communities are hurting, we want something rather than nothing. In many oppressed communities, drug treatment, good schools, economic investment, job training, trauma and grief support are not available options. Restorative justice is not an option. The only thing on offer is prisons, prosecutors and police.

But what happens, Ms. Sered wondered, if instead of asking, “Do you want something or nothing?” we started asking “Do you want this intervention or that prison?” It turns out, when given a real choice, very few survivors choose prison as their preferred response.

This is not because survivors, as a group, are especially merciful. To the contrary, they’re pragmatic. They know the criminal justice system will almost certainly fail to deliver what they want and need most to overcome their pain and trauma. More than 95 percent of cases end in plea bargains negotiated by lawyers behind the scenes. Given the system’s design, survivors know the system cannot be trusted to validate their suffering, give them answers or even a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Nor can it be trusted to keep them or others safe.

In fact, many victims find that incarceration actually makes them feel less safe. They worry that others will be angry with them for reporting the crime and retaliate, or fear what will happen when the person eventually returns home. Many believe, for good reason, that incarceration will likely make the person worse, not better — a frightening prospect when they’re likely to encounter the person again when they’re back in the neighborhood."
