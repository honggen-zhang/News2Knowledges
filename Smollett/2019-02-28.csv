She Resides In Indiana With Her Husband', 'Wnd Staff', 'Wnd News Services', 'Erin Coates', 'The Western Journal', 'Randy Desoto', 'Ryan Foley']",,"['company', 'smolletts', 'reporter', 'chicago', 'trump', 'crimes', 'crime', 'hollywood', 'smollett', 'hate', 'plenty', 'jussie']","The information that has been emerging about what really happened to Jussie Smollett on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m. in downtown Chicago has blown a hole in his original story wide enough to drive a tank through.

Chicago police were diligent in their investigation. Although, as noted by Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Smollett was originally believed and treated as a crime victim, the evidence that has subsequently emerged makes it appear that he first mailed himself a threatening letter with white powder (which turned out to be a simple over-the-counter painkiller – acetaminophen). Smollett then apparently paid two brothers, Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, to stage an attack against him that he could later claim was racist and homophobic, an attack that would give the threatening letter more credence and that Smollett would be able to blame on Trump supporters.

Even as the public was discovering the truth, Smollett continued to maintain his innocence. ""I swear to God,"" he reportedly said to his cast-mates on the set of ""Empire,"" ""I did not do this.""

But it appears that he did do it. Why?

One explanation that has been offered is that he felt he was not being paid enough. Another possibility is Smollett is suffering from an untreated drug problem, a claim he is said to have made to the Chicago police. This not only sounds like a possible defense to the crimes with which Smollett has been charged; it also smacks of Hollywood publicists and image massagers working furiously behind the scenes. We've all seen the template: a little bit of mea culpa (but only insofar as admitting to substance abuse is concerned), just enough time out of the public eye for the lights to shine on someone else, a few well-placed magazine and talk-show interviews after the perfunctory stint in rehab – and voila! Smollett emerges a new man, poised to generate the public forgiveness that usually follows celebrities' fall from grace. We're all only human, after all, there but for the grace of God, and so on ...

Additionally, social media is now abuzz with speculation about Smollett's mental and emotional health. He wouldn't come up with such a scheme, the argument goes, unless he's mentally ill or emotionally unstable. Indeed, the Hollywood Reporter published a sympathetic article Feb. 27 that looks back at Smollett's career since childhood. A combination of interviews with persons close to Smollett and recent quotes from Smollett himself raises the question of whether the pressures of fame may have prompted him to concoct such a scheme.

Whether or not Jussie Smollett was, in fact, driven by emotional instability to perpetuate a ""hoax crime,"" he certainly has plenty of company. Another Hollywood Reporter article published the same day explores Hollywood's history of faked ""hate crimes."" The author takes pains to note at the beginning of the piece, ""Very few hate crimes are fake."" But a significant number of the high-profile cases seem to be. (The Duke lacrosse rape case is a notable example.) Wilfred Reilly, author of the upcoming book ""Hate Crime Hoax,"" points to the same FBI data as the Hollywood Reporter: Approximately 7,000 hate crimes were reported in the United States in 2017, and only 8 to 10 percent are faked. But, Reilly notes, several hundred highly visible ""hate crimes"" have turned out to be fake over the years.

Reilly explains that in many cases, hate crime hoaxers are motivated to call attention to a cause they feel is important and insufficiently addressed. It doesn't appear that this was Smollett's motivation. But for whatever else one can say about Jussie Smollett, he must have known his story would be believed. He counted on it being believable, because it fits the worldview of so many in the entertainment industry and the media. He counted on the glaring, gaping holes in his story being overlooked (Chicago is no bastion of Trump support; no one says ""MAGA country""; nobody cares that he is black or gay; no one goes out looking for victims at 2 a.m. when it's minus 10 degrees outside; no one would have even known who he was, bundled up in that weather) because we have a class of self-important elites that overlooks inconvenient reality every single day to pitch its narrative that Trump voters are a class of sexist, racist, homophobic, deplorable bigots 63 million strong. And the elites preach this narrative from their perches with their six- and seven- (and eight-) figure incomes, their Ivy League sinecures and their walled estates.

Mental illness? Could be. Drug problem? Perhaps. Or maybe Jussie Smollett just thought he'd get away with doing his version of what our press, our entertainment industry, half of our politicians and a huge chunk of our educational establishment do every single day."

Pam Northam picked the wrong children to ask to hold cotton.

The wife of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam — who is currently recovering from his own racially-charged controversy — found herself in hot water after the mother of a local black student claimed she asked her daughter to hold raw cotton on a recent tour of the governor’s mansion.

According to The Washington Post, Leah Dozier Walker sent a letter to lawmakers that her eighth-grade daughter Alexandra was left “upset and deeply offended” after going on a Senate Page trip to the residence on February 21.

Walker, who oversees the Office of Equity and Community Engagement at the state’s Education Department, claimed Northam asked Alexandra and two other pages, the only black pages in the program, to hold cotton as they toured the Historic Kitchen of the Executive Mansion.

She then accused Northam of asking “these three pages if they could imagine what it must have been like to pick cotton all day,” adding:

“I can not for the life of me understand why the First Lady would single out the African American pages for this — or — why she would ask them such an insensitive question.”

Wow. If that’s true, it’s stupidly offensive.

Of course, a rep for the administration denied that the black students were singled out, telling the Richmond-Times Dispatch that the First Lady encouraged every student to touch the cotton. The spokeswoman said in a statement:

“The First Lady did not single anyone out; she invited all of the pages to touch agricultural products and artifacts displayed in the Historic Kitchen as part of an educational tour.”

Northam issued her own apology to the outlet, claiming that the cotton picking incident was added to the tour in attempt to shed light on the historically omitted stories of the enslaved people who used to live in the Historic Kitchen cottage.

She wrote:

“As First Lady, I have worked over the course of the last year to begin telling the full story of the Executive Mansion, which has mainly centered on Virginia’s governors. The Historic Kitchen should be a feature of Executive Mansion tours, and I believe it does a disservice to Virginians to omit the stories of the enslaved people who lived and worked there — that’s why I have been engaged in an effort to thoughtfully and honestly share this important story since I arrived in Richmond. I have provided the same educational tour to Executive Mansion visitors over the last few months and used a variety of artifacts and agricultural crops with the intention of illustrating a painful period of Virginia history. I regret that I have upset anyone. I am still committed to chronicling the important history of the Historic Kitchen, and will continue to engage historians and experts on the best way to do so in the future.”

Well, the First Lady did shed a light on racism… just maybe not the way she intended.

For what it’s worth, another parent of a student in the group backed the rep’s claim that Northam didn’t single out the black students.

Either way, this incident comes at a tense time for the First Couple of Virginia. Just weeks ago, Governor Northam’s page in Eastern Virginia Medical School’s 1984 yearbook resurfaced, showing a man in blackface and another man in a KKK robe.

The 59-year-old originally apologized for the photo, but has since claimed he was not either of the men pictured.

The governor has been adamant that he will remain at his post for the remainder of his term and hopes to gain back citizens’ trust. We don’t think this is helping in that department.

The Toronto rapper has partnered with Wynn Las Vegas for the venture, which will see him perform a number of gigs at the modestly-sized XS Nightclub, which has a capacity of just 4800.

The first dates of the residency will take place on May 4 and May 18 respectively, with at least five live dates planned so far.

“We’re going to completely remove the DJ booth,” Wynn’s VP Alex Cordova told Rolling Stone about the planned Vegas shows. “Our artists perform in the round, so essentially, where the exterior and the interior space meets in the centre, that’s where the stage is going to be.

“So Drake is going to be able to perform for the intimate crowd of 1,800 [on one side] and also to [a crowd of around 3,000] on the other side.”

Drake has become the latest major artist to land a residency in Vegas, following in the recent footsteps of the likes of Cardi B and Blink-182.

Drake will tour the UK and Ireland on the ‘Assassination Vacation’ tour next month – see the planned live dates below.

He insists he is innocent, and of course we should treat him as such until proven otherwise (though the Court of Public Opinion usually works the opposite way, unfortunately). However, the damage has already been done for Smollett, who has been dropped from the remainder of season five of Empire.

Predictably, he’s already become a pawn of partisan political rhetoric, an unwitting tool in the eternal, petty, public “gotcha” game played by modern media and pundits. I’ve been mulling over this situation, and found myself wondering (like many of us) why Smollett would resort to such alleged behavior, if he is indeed guilty as charged.

What follows is entirely speculation on my part. I have no idea what it’s like to be in Smollett’s situation. I’m not an actor. I’m not African American. I’m not gay. I don’t claim to know Smollett’s mind as a unique individual, and I don’t have encyclopedic knowledge of the biological and sociological roots of our habits as a species.

Still, at the same time, I am endlessly fascinated by the workings of the human mind. I’m keenly interested in the study of our behavior. I can’t help but consider Smollett’s case in the light of our current cultural context.

The Loneliness Factor

If he is guilty, could Smollett have been motivated by loneliness? Many would-be experts, including a US senator and a former Surgeon General, are alerting us to a veritable “epidemic” of isolation. It’s a strange irony to consider: in a “hyperconnected” age facilitated by the most advanced communication technology ever invented, why is loneliness still a problem?

Many culprits have been identified as sources of modern loneliness:

Transient Socioeconomic Structures

When the workforce trend shifted away from the “stay at one job until you retire” reality of the past, this also took with it a significant source of social connection. Think of how often modern workers change jobs, and the coworker relationships that are ended as a result. When you start a new position, you must not only learn new routines, processes, and skills. You must also navigate a company’s existing social environment to “find your place” and create new connections.

What about the descent of that former staple of the “American dream,” home ownership? With the decline of the widespread ability to own, the relative affordability of renting can go hand-in-hand with a more frequent change of address, as people are often forced by rising costs to seek cheaper roofs to dwell under.

All of this lends a disconcerting, stressful transience to modern life.

Ideological Divides

Political hacks have been blamed for ramping up ideological rhetoric over the last couple decades. What better way to solidify a party’s voting base than by whipping them into a zealous frenzy driven by fear? This can be accomplished by turning political opponents into existential threats. When an ideology becomes your very identity, anyone questioning your beliefs isn’t just someone who disagrees with you; they become “a danger to your way of life.”

This tactic has had the unfortunate side effect of creating a divisive sociopolitical gang mentality.

The Island Illusion

Today, we have access to such convenience and abundance, we have duped ourselves into thinking we don’t need the level of community and cooperation that was necessary throughout most of human history. This fallacy has caused us to lose connection with each other.

To some extent, we all suffer from an internal dissonance that is tearing us apart: our rational minds tell us we’re self-sufficient, but our instincts crave social interaction. Fortunately, the communal instinct tends to win out in times of tragedy. Unfortunately, it’s a sad state of affairs if we need disasters to bring us back together.

When infrastructure fails or man-made crises arise, we still fall back on the kindness of our fellow human beings. It’s just a shame it takes “bad things” to break the illusion we’re all islands unto ourselves.

Unsocial Media

Then there’s the irony of supposedly “social” media. Are we really keeping in touch with people if we throw likes on their vacation photos but never see them in person? Or are we waking up to the realization that human relationships do—and should—require more work for them to be genuine?

Combating Loneliness

All of the above are just a few factors that contribute to loneliness. This epidemic is strongly correlated with public health issues like suicide and drug abuse.

You’re probably wondering what all this has to do with Jussie Smollett’s case. Again, I don’t know the details of his life, but I’m wondering if some of the common social pressures mentioned above have impacted him. Fame doesn’t necessarily inoculate someone against loneliness.

Indeed, fame adds another set of potentially isolating pitfalls. Jussie might have struggled with the fickle “cult” of celebrity. Could concerns about his level of renown driven him to stage a crime in a bid to boost his name recognition? Fame comes with its own insidious variety of loneliness. Jussie could be another victim of celebrity’s paradoxical swirl of isolation and lack of privacy. What is it like to have the “surface adoration” of multitudes but realize they don’t know you on a real, deep level?

Again, this is all speculation, but I bring it up because we shouldn’t ignore the artificial and insidious pressures of modern society on the human mind.

So, what can we do to combat loneliness? I’d like to hear your ideas. For my part, I believe the first step is to acknowledge we all need to be mindful of the effect of social pressures on our well-being, and the well-being of others. It’s not enough to just worry about ourselves. This epidemic needs to be addressed in a way that is the antithesis of loneliness: cooperation between as many of us as possible.

Kelly hate train.

In a recent interview with Variety, Graham voices his support for the embattled singer and even refers to Kelly as a ""friend.""

""He’s a good friend of mine,"" Graham told the publication. ""I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him.""

Insinuating that Kelly's accusers are lying, Graham continued, ""There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.""

Graham's comments arrive on the heels of the 12 Play artist being charged with 10 counts of criminal sexual abuse, which could land him in jail for close to a decade.

In addition to siding with Kelly, Graham also offered up his thoughts on Jussie Smollett's alleged homophobic and racially-driven attack. According to Drizzy's dad, the Empire actor's story is being manipulated by the police.

""Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that,"" Graham explained. ""That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.""

Meanwhile, Mr. Graham is following in his son's footsteps by putting out a song of his own this week called ""That on That,"" which he originally recorded ten years ago.

Most notably, they attacked the idea of racial reparations for slavery, telling 2020 Democrat Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) that she can’t “buy” their “silence.”

“We have a message for Kamala Harris: You can keep your reparations. You don’t get to buy my silence,” Hardaway declared. “We will never let the Democratic Party forget that they are the party of Jim Crow. They are the party of slavery.”

Hardaway and Richardson emphasized their independence from identity politics, emphatically saying that they can think for themselves.

Turning to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Hardaway denounced socialism as a source of poverty. “What makes America great is through capitalism, how we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps” she declared. “So we can live the American dream and not have to live through an American nightmare.”

Hardaway addressed the issues of immigration and abortion in one powerful phrase. “When an illegal immigrant comes through the border illegally, the Left wants to help them. But when a baby comes through the birth canal legally, they want to kill them,” she said, to Richardson’s agreement.

The pair praised America as “the greatest country on earth,” and firmly defended the Constitution against Democrat efforts to change it. “We don’t need to rewrite the Constitution. They need to reread the Constitution,” Hardaway said to loud applause.

Turning to the hate hoax involving Empire star Jussie Smollett, Hardaway said, “When they try to use the race card, I want you to stand up and you play the Trump card!”

She mocked the people who believed Smollett, saying, “That’s what happens when you let a Democrat use you like a tool.”

Earlier this week, homophobic tweets surfaced, which were deleted but now it is being reported they used anti-gay slurs on the set of “Empire.” The brothers said in a public statement they are not homophobic.

The Daily Mail exclusively reported that Alex McDaniel was an actor on set with Abel Osundairo when they filmed at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center in Chicago in July of 2015.

“I was hired to be on the set to play a gang banger for season two of the show,” McDaniel said. “I remember meeting the brothers, the smallest one was quite well-mannered and well-tempered, very quiet and barely spoke. His brother who was taller was a little more agitated about what he was seeing that day.”

He continued: “I swapped a few words with the taller brother. I remember we were doing a prison scene and Lee Daniels (the director), who is openly gay, asked all the guys with muscles to take their shirts off. I just remember his attitude being very funky and very stank like.” They were on set for 12-13 hours and a conversation began with the group of actors about having a gay friend. “It became very uncomfortable for me, the taller Nigerian guy was very agitated about the fact of me being gay, Lee Daniels being gay, gay people period, he was not okay with that notion,” McDaniel said.

He claimed Abel said, “I would never have a gay friend, I don’t really like gay people.” Another actor, Ticarus Bunch, was there and told Daily Mail that Abel went further, calling gay people “f**gots.” Bunch said the conversation was also about the show “Empire” being groundbreaking for LGBT characters. Bunch claimed Abel said, “Then it came round to having homosexual friends and the Nigerian said, ‘hell no, I won’t have no gay people around me, no f*****ts around me, f**k that.’ He was real adamant about it.”

McDaniel reportedly “cursed him out” but everyone tried to remain calm because they didn’t want to ruin the opportunity on “Empire.” Both McDaniel and Bunch said Ola was much nicer and introverted. Another witness, Lawrence Johnson Jr., confirmed the incident happened.

The Chicago Police Department claimed the brothers told them the attack against Smollert was orchestra by the “Empire” actor and that they were paid $3,500. The brothers released the following statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

However, The Blast reported two tweets were deleted this past week. Ola Osundairo tweeted in 2013, “Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right.” Another message read, “YOU’RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.” Ola also once wrote, “I don’t follow any man. I follow woman.”

Earlier this week, TMZ reported the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent a hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reported, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reported, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

The brothers were also on video appearing to buy items allegedly used for the attack.

That the United States has a long history of racism and homophobia, and an equally long history of violence against members of these communities, is not new information. And while it is encouraging to see that more people are primed to believe victims of that violence, it’s telling that people are just as likely to doubt those beliefs at the first possible moment.

Seemingly overnight, actor Jussie Smollett was transformed from a central rallying point to an outright villain for allegedly lying about being the victim of a homophobic, racist hate crime on January 29. The details quickly unraveled from there; and over the past three weeks, the CPD’s view of events has contradicted Smollett’s original story almost entirely. On January 21, Smollett said he received hate mail from the Empire set; later reports suggested he may have sent it to himself, but an FBI source told TMZ the sender’s identity is still inconclusive. The CPD identified brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo as persons of interest — whom Smollet allegedly knew through their work together on Empire — but later let them go after questioning. Just as the smoke was clearing, new evidence was presented to prove that the Osundairo brothers were paid $3,500 to train Smollett for an upcoming music video, not to attack him.

The nonstop updates and inconsistent information means that, for many people, it’s hard to know what or who to trust. And because social media disseminates updates and opinions in equal measure and in real time, the curious case against Smollett has created factions: One vocal group of people have called to immediately cancel him, without more information, for allegedly untruthful behavior that police say is tied to his own personal gain. The other is to dismiss Smollett’s behaviors even if the police’s allegations hold true. I, however, am in another camp: the gray area of supporting someone while also holding them accountable for potential wrongdoing, particularly if the only person they’ve harmed is themselves.

But the past several days have illustrated an opposing belief that Smollett not only harmed himself, but the entire Black LGBTQ+ community as proxy. That kind of thinking is often a result of centering the thoughts and opinions of those who aren’t members of our community — namely, white people and straight Black people. Centering what other communities think runs the risk of reinforcing who is in “power” and who is given the opportunity to serve as judgment, which is rarely afforded to Black queer and transgender people.

To that end, concerns have been raised that, in the wake of Smollett’s alleged fabrications, victims of hate crimes and survivors of violence, namely Black LGBTQ people, now won’t be believed if they come forward with their trauma. But ours is a society that doesn’t inherently believe survivors anyway; the 2018 hashtag #WhyIDidntReport makes clear that many survivors of violence never reported out of fear of not being believed or feeling ashamed of the assault. But when survivors of violence are not believed in our society, dominant groups maintain power, and that is rarely shifted to marginalized communities. “The only harm done to survivors in [Smollett’s] case is that publicly casting suspicion on us, even without all the facts, has become widely accepted as amusing or seen as prudent journalism,” says Dana Vivian White, a non-binary DC-based speaker and trainer. “What’s most dangerous about Smollett’s case though has been the remarkable rush to make him a joke or the convenient scapegoat of media figures who have their on bias or agenda.”

Placing the blame on one individual — especially given the fact that communities in power seem all too ready to cancel minority groups for “acting up,” yet seem entirely willing to extend unlimited chances when one of their own fumbles — is harmful and disingenuous.

Charlene Carruthers, author of Unapologetic: A Black, Queer and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements, tells MTV News, “The truth is that Black LGBTQ+ folks are not safe from policing or violence at the hands of the people we know.”

She adds, “This story exists in a world where homophobic and transphobic policy and societal beliefs are pervasive. We can leverage the tragedy of this story to have critical conversations and the build systems for accountability and healing Black people need.”

To be clear, I make no apology for having believed Smollett when his story came out. I believe victims of violence generally when they come forward with their trauma. If there's an apology to be made, it is that I apologize that we have systems that constantly minimize actual violence happening to Black LGBTQ+ people. Our society does not value Black people or LGBTQ people, and certainly not people at those intersections.

Make no mistake: LGBTQ+ people of color still experience hate crimes at higher rates than white and heterosexual people. Last year, the FBI reported a 17 percent year-over-year increase in federal hate crimes across the United States, the third consecutive yearly rise. The annual report illustrated there were 7,175 bias crimes, which targeted 8,493 victims based on sexual orientation and race.

According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), hate crimes against members of Black LGBTQ communites have increased, often at rates far outpacing their white counterparts. Of the total number of homicides against LGBTQ people in 2017, 60 percent of victims were Black while 23 percent of victims were white, according to the NCAVP. 2016 was the deadliest year ever for LGBTQ people since the NCAVP began tracking hate crimes; out of the 28 reported hate violence homicides, apart from the tragedy at Pulse, 22 of victims were people of color. When they do come forward to report these crimes, it’s important that they feel like people believe them, and it’s crucial that safe spaces are made available to victims and survivors.

Yet despite increasing attacks directed at members of the LGBTQ community, many victims still hesitate to report. Researchers have found LGTBQ victims often fail to report hate crimes out of fear that law enforcement will not correctly categorize the incident as a hate crime. A 2018 report published by the U.S. Department of Justice noted that ""victims… may not trust law enforcement or other authorities to take them seriously."" The legal definition of a hate crime is also incredibly narrow.

In Smollett’s case, he is a celebrity, so people are primed to care about his actions and alleged misdeeds. Accordingly, the CPD decided to dedicate voluminous resources, including as many as a dozen detectives, to solve his case. Why they don’t have the resources to attend to other crimes with the same fervor is unclear.

74% of 5,534 tracked homicides in Chicago never resulted in arrest. What’s more, homicides in which the victim was white more likely resulted in arrest than homicides where the victim was Black. In 2017, after several complaints of excessive force and the violation of residents’ civil rights, the Department of Justice found that Chicago police “have violated the constitutional rights of residents for years, permitting racial bias against blacks, using excessive force and shooting people who did not pose immediate threats.” We should be questioning law enforcement agencies that are quick to prosecute Black people and slow to investigate Black deaths. It doesn’t escape me how swiftly the CPD moved to determine that Smollett invented a hoax for indeterminate gain.

I am also reminded of the history of minimal outrage of white lies on Black bodies, which are more common than many of us would like to believe. Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts, yet white police officers who kill Black people are rarely held accountable for their actions. Moreover, Black men often receive longer sentences than their white counterparts for the same crimes, and judges are less likely to revise sentences downward for Black men than they are for white men. In short, the legal system — and one’s credibility — can be bent toward whiteness.

I don’t believe that Smollett made life harder for Black LGBTQ+ people. Life is already hard for us. From increased homelessness, to rates of suicide, to discrimination from healthcare providers, the reality of Black LGBTQ+ life is no crystal star. One person, no matter how famous, won’t tip those scales. Presiding over the story of one man in either the court of public opinion, or in an actual court of law, will not undo the deaths of the Black trans women who were murdered in 2018. It will not undo the fact that the life expectancy of trans women of color is 31. But Smollett does serve as a litmus test, and a moment to take stock in who believes survivors, who believes the marginalized, and who is entirely too ready to blame an entire community for the alleged actions of one person.

People have often asked me, “Do you honestly believe Smollett?” That question isn’t important to me. What I care about is the way, intentionally or not, Smollett helped reveal just as much, if not more, about our society than his alleged aberration did about himself.

One of the things about family is that you definitely don’t choose them and you most certainly can’t control them.

Drake’s daddy is a rogue, pimpin’ soul from Memphis. But who knew he was pals with R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett?

According to an interview in Variety, Aubrey’s father is not only friends with two of Black America’s Most Wanted, but he’s also a staunch defender of both men who have pretty much been successfully tried in the court of public opinion and social media.

Drake’s Dad on R.Kelly:

“He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.”

Drake’s Dad on Jussie Smollett:

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Now here’s what I’m trying to figure out: When the hell did Drake’s daddy become friends with R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett?!?

R. Kelly, I can kind of see since they’re closer in age. But what events was Papa Dennis going to that he would run into Jussie, of all people? Drake never made a guest star appearance on Empire so it’s not like he met Jussie through his son.

And furthermore, when have either of them had the time to update Dennis on their criminal/legal situations for him to say that R. Kelly has his support 100% or that the police got Jussie’s story all wrong? Cause there’s no way I’m believing that Drake’s old pimp juice daddy is on speed dial for either Lying Ass Jussie or Pee-Pee Pedophile Robert.

Can Drake please help his daddy pick out better friends? And also, it might be a good idea to hook Dennis up with a real PR person because that Variety interview is a hot ghetto mess and that single of his, “That on That,” is some nonsensical trash that should’ve never seen the light of day."

But in the same way, to pretend that you were attacked by white men, there has to be a fair amount of hate and anger.”

For conservative critics, the Smollett hoax raised deeper questions about whether leftist partisans are too quick to believe anything negative about Trump supporters. But criminologists say a hoax should not be used to dismiss the atmosphere that prosecutors say Mr. Smollett sought to manipulate. Hate crimes increased for the third year in a row in 2017 – up 17 percent, according to an FBI report released in November.

The arrest of actor Jussie Smollett, who police say perpetrated a hoax that played on anti-Trump sentiments, came a day after the arrest of a US Coast Guard officer who prosecutors say was a white supremacist would-be assassin. Christopher Hasson, prosecutors say, amassed a stockpile of weapons, alongside a hit list of politicians – including the speaker of the House and several senators – and TV journalists verbally targeted by President Trump.

Wilfred Reilly is a political science professor at Kentucky State University, a historically black university in Frankfort.

But at heart, he is, as he says, “a regular dude from Chicago.”

As such, he can feel concern about a rise in right-wing extremism and warnings from hate trackers that unscripted angry presidential rhetoric could lead to violence against minorities. But to him, at least, hate has become far more egalitarian than that.

“When I go to the gun range, there’s a whole selection of targets you can buy: There’s Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman; there’s the redneck racist looking guy with a beer belly and the black urban thug in a ski mask,” says Professor Reilly, an African-American and author of the just-released book, “Hate Crime Hoax.”

The symbolism of those gun range targets really struck Reilly as he pondered last week’s events: the arrest of a gay black actor in Chicago who police say perpetrated a hoax that played on anti-Trump sentiments. The arrest of Jussie Smollett came a day after the arrest of a US Coast Guard officer who prosecutors say was a white supremacist would-be assassin. Christopher Hasson, prosecutors say, amassed a stockpile of weapons in Silver Spring, Md., alongside a hit list of politicians – including the speaker of the House and several senators – and TV journalists verbally targeted by President Trump.

“Both hate crimes and hate crime hoaxes come from the same well of anger and dissonance,” says Reilly. “To want to kill another person, there needs to be a lot of hate and anger. But in the same way, to pretend that you were attacked by white men, there has to be a fair amount of hate and anger.”

The hoax allegedly perpetrated by the “Empire” actor wasn't just shocking, for many it confirmed perceptions of how gullible the mainstream press can be. For conservative critics, the Smollett hoax raised deeper questions about whether leftist partisans are too quick to believe anything negative about Trump supporters.

But criminologists say a hoax should not be used to dismiss the atmosphere that prosecutors say Mr. Smollett sought to manipulate. Hate crimes increased for the third year in a row in 2017 – up 17 percent, according to an FBI report released in November. Some 60 percent of victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity, and the largest increase was in anti-Semitic crimes, which jumped 37 percent in one year.

Seen that way, the hoax and the plot each became “a cudgel that political pundits have used to sling anecdotes at each other [and] where actual national security and criminological findings are drowned out,” says Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San Bernardino, in an email. That comes, he adds, “at an inflection point where the risks [posed by] political violence have shifted.”

It is worth noting that law enforcement got their suspects in both cases. And as Reilly notes: “There is no epidemic of people just attacking their fellow Americans.”

But both the hoax and plot can be seen as sides of the same coin, minted in a country increasingly separated by ideas and values, bonded, it sometimes seems, only by a growing distrust.

How many hoaxes?

To many Americans, the Smollett case highlighted a different, but equally uncomfortable truth: that hate can inspire false reporting, which in turn can be deeply damaging to trust and law-enforcement resources. The Smollett case occupied the time of 11 detectives in a city with a low murder clearance rate.

Ashlee Rezin/Chicago Sun-Time/AP ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett (c.) leaves Cook County jail following his release, Feb. 21, in Chicago. Mr. Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct and filling a false police report when he said he was attacked by two men who hurled racist and antigay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, a police official said.

But Professor Levin says he counted just 49 fake reports between 2016 and 2018, making such reports less than 1 percent of an estimated 20,000 total hate crimes reported over the same period. “We also found an increase in hate homicides [in 2018] and an increase in far-right and white nationalist incidents, separate from hate crime data,” Levin adds. “What we found has been a collapse in violent jihadist plots and homicides and an increase in far-right and white nationalist plots and homicides.”

“What is so dreadful and fascinating is how the Smollett case has not become a springboard for understanding about the actual prevalence of the minuscule number of false reports and the rise of hate crimes and violent extremism, particularly by white nationalist and related extremists,” says Levin.

In his book, Reilly says he counted 409 confirmed race-based hoaxes over a five-year period – about 1.5 percent of reports – suggesting to him a more significant prevalence of false reporting, and a more nuanced story.

The White House has vehemently defended the president against accusations that he is tacitly encouraging attacks, saying he has been quick, if not the first, to condemn hateful acts. Mr. Trump called Smollett’s alleged hoax “dangerous” and “racist,” while noting Hasson’s plot was “a shame.”

At the same time, a Southern Poverty Law Center hate crime report released last week suggests that far-right extremist groups have grown by 50 percent just in the past year, in part out of frustration with the president’s failure to build the promised border wall. That campaign promise deals with border security, but has also been seen as a powerful symbol by groups determined to keep the US a white majority country.

‘How we perceive threats’

According to former FBI agent Michael German, who infiltrated white extremist groups after the Oklahoma City bombing, law enforcement has been slow to shift resources, concentrating only a fraction of the $2.8 trillion spent to counter terror from 2002 to 2017 on right-wing extremists. Meanwhile, the bulk of counterterrorism efforts are aimed at threats from overseas, such as Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Between 2008 and 2017, domestic extremists killed 387 people in the United States, according to a 2018 Anti-Defamation League report, while Islamist extremists killed 100. From 2007 to 2011, there were five or fewer attacks by right-wing extremists per year. In 2017, there were 31.

Take one week this past fall: In the span of seven days, Cesar Sayoc, a Florida man who lived in a van plastered with pro-Trump propaganda, is alleged to have sent a series of pipe bombs to Trump’s critics, none of which detonated. Two days after the first pipe bomb was reported, a Kentucky man tried to break into a black church and then killed two elderly black people outside a Kroger, telling an armed white man who confronted him that “whites don’t kill whites.” A few days later, a white nationalist in Pennsylvania killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood and injured many others, including police officers.

“A big part of this gets to our base human nature regarding how we perceive threats and how we identify the ‘other’ in a white-majority country where the political class doesn’t see white people as the enemy,” says Mr. German. “Part of the reason that the government doesn’t fear far-right extremism is that it’s reactionary and tends to reinforce existing political, social, and economic inequities that the establishment has created. That’s why the government tends to be more concerned about Black Lives Matter than it does neo-Nazi skinheads going out and engaging in hate crimes.”

For example, a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report that accurately predicted a rise in attacks by far-right extremists – including, like Hasson, military veterans – was withdrawn after Republicans like former House Speaker John Boehner called it offensive. Last year, the FBI issued a report warning of a rise in violent black extremism, even though African-Americans and Jews are far more likely to be targeted by violent extremists.

“I don’t think we are in a very good place at all,” says Daryl Johnson, the former lead domestic terrorism intelligence expert who authored that 2009 report. “Local and federal law enforcement do a good job when they can, but we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who subscribe to antigovernment and racist extremism, and any one of these people are on the path to radicalization. They exploit and hide behind our constitutional rights.”

For his part, Mr. Johnson, now the head of DT Analytics and author of “Rightwing Resurgence,” has spent decades trying to understand those wellsprings of hate.

While institutions like the FBI work to contain the threat, the most important thing Americans can do, says Johnson, is to spend more time listening to the other side – not just to understand their ideology, but to extend a sense of humanity.

“I have learned in my own life that we need to engage a lot of these people instead of ostracize them and shun them,” says Johnson. “When you do that, they are left to their own devices and become even more radicalized. When we reintegrate them back into our own families, we are at least giving them ... a sense of belonging. We can, in fact, combat the hate for government [and other people] with love and compassion.”"

Now the rest of his legal case awaits — and his career with it.

CNN spoke to several legal and public relations experts to better understand what lies ahead for the actor, who faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct for claiming he was attacked by two men on January 29 in Chicago.

The future of his case

Smollett, an actor on the show “Empire,” had told police that two attackers yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him.

But after an extensive investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack and take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Two weeks after the alleged incident, when doubts about his story began to surface, Smollett expressed frustration at not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” Smollett said on “Good Morning America.” “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Most immediately, Smollett is due back in court March 14. In court last week, the judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct under the section about filing a false police report, which is considered a Class 4 felony. Class 4 felonies are punishable by one to three years in prison, according to Illinois state law.

Disorderly conduct is generally not charged as a felony, Chicago defense attorney Steven Hunter told CNN in an email. But the national and international attention on the case likely made the charge more significant for the defendant, he said. And that could impact any future punishment if he is convicted, he said.

“In my experience, the more publicity a case has, the worse it is for the defendant,” Hunter said.

More than a decade ago, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case, according to Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.

The case stemmed from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police someone else’s name.

The future of his plea

As with any criminal case, it is possible that Smollett and prosecutors could agree to a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea.

For example, a felony false police report case from almost a decade ago suggests one possible path ahead.

In 2010, a doctor and University of Iowa professor named Gary Hunninghake told Chicago police that he had been mugged and stabbed while out for a run on Chicago’s Riverwalk. He later admitted the attack never happened and that he actually stabbed himself, CNN affiliate WLS reported at the time.

He was charged with a felony for the hoax, according to Cook County court records. In January 2011, he pleaded guilty to a lesser misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge, CNN affiliate WBBM reported.

Would Smollett and prosecutors consider a guilty plea? So far, Smollett has continued to maintain his innocence. A statement released last week on behalf of the actor said the bail hearing was an “organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.”

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” the statement said.

Steven Goldman, another defense attorney in Chicago, told CNN it will be difficult for police to agree to a plea deal with Smollett because of the intense publicity here.

“This is publicly known that it took so many resources away from Chicago’s police department that, how are you going to justify it with giving him a slap on the wrist?” he said. “So I think his case is going to be a little more difficult than just an regular ordinary defendant’s case because its profile is so (high) right now.”

The future of his career

One thing is certain: Smollett will not be on Fox’s show “Empire” anytime soon.

The producers behind “Empire” have decided to remove his character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of the current season following his arrest this week. The decision was made to “avoid further disruption on set,” producers said.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” the statement said. “Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

The statement was signed by seven “Empire” producers, including Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, and showrunner Brett Mahoney. “Empire” is in the midst of filming its fifth season finale in Chicago.

No matter how his legal case turns out, Smollett’s career prospects beyond “Empire” will be limited in the immediate future.

However, Jill Stanley, a defense attorney and celebrity legal analyst, said he has a chance to come back to Hollywood if he shows “extreme accountability” and apologizes to the communities his alleged hoax hurt.

“I do not think Jussie Smollett’s career is totally over in Hollywood. We live in a forgiving society and I think in today’s world people can understand the pressures a little bit more than they used to,” she said.

Howard Breuer, CEO of Newsroom PR, similarly said it was possible for Smollett to come back to show business if he admits fault and apologizes.

“Two years from now, if he plays it right, I can see him getting new roles and even sort of treating it as an embarrassing thing,” Breuer said. “I’m not guaranteeing that he can be rehabilitated in the eyes of Hollywood, but I’m saying we see, for some people, that they are able to pull it off.”

But Ronn Torossian, the CEO of public relations firm 5WPR, was less optimistic.

“I don’t believe that Jussie Smollett, regardless of if he takes a plea or not, has a career in Hollywood,” he said."

Graham said in an exclusive interview with Variety Magazine that both disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly and fibbing Empire actor Jussie Smollett have his support. Kelly, who has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse and Smollett, who is charged with a filing a false police report have been getting slayed in the court of public opinion but the elder Graham says that he stands behind both men 100%.

Now, Santos — who is living in the United States without legal documentation — also faces possible deportation.

AD

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers from the agency’s fugitive-operations team detained Santos on Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. The woman was released from ICE custody and entered into removal proceedings in federal immigration court, the official said. She is expected to appear in court at a future date.

It is not clear how ICE learned of Santos’s case. The Falmouth Police Department told The Washington Post it did not know of her immigration status at the time of her arrest and did not notify ICE. It is possible, a police spokesperson said, that a notification to ICE was triggered when Santos’s name was entered into the department’s systems.

John Mohan, an ICE spokesman for the New England region, told The Post that “ICE does not publicly discuss intelligence and research tools and methods that our agents and officers may use in their work.”

Santos’s attorney, Katarina Kozakova, told Boston.com that Santos is married to a U.S. citizen and is waiting for her green card to be approved. ICE’s involvement in her case means her green-card application now will be reviewed by an immigration judge, rather than Citizenship and Immigration Services, Kozakova said.

“That is the only change this arrest has cost Rosiane in terms of her immigration,” Kozakova said.

Kozakova did not immediately respond to an interview request from The Post.

Bryton Turner identified himself as the victim of the assault in an statement to NBC News. He is also listed on the police report. Turner told NBC that Santos began “harassing me verbally” as soon as he walked into the restaurant.

“All I said was: ‘I can wear this hat wherever I want. This is America,’ ” Turner said.

AD

He said he began taking video of the incident “so she would stop,” NBC reported. “I didn’t think it would blow up like this,” Turner said.

The video, which was posted to Facebook but later taken down, shows Turner sitting at what looks like a bar and filming his face as Santos walks behind him.

“See this right here? This is the problem,” Turner says in the video. “Ignorant people like this. I’m just trying to sit here and eat a nice meal, and look at this.""

AD

""You see this?” Turner says as Santos approaches him from behind, pushes his MAGA hat over his eyes and utters expletives.

“People like that, that’s the problem,” Turner says. “That’s the problem with our America these days. People are just ignorant. They want to lash out on people that are educated.”

In the police report, officers said that Santos used an expletive to characterize how she felt about the man’s support of Trump. The officers wrote that her speech was slurred and she was clearly intoxicated. As one officer tried to escort her from the restaurant, the police report said, Santos “began walking but stopped behind the male wearing the red hat, grabbed his hat and moved it around in a circular motion while violently pushing his head down toward the bar.”

Turner did not respond to an interview request from The Post.

The Massachusetts incident is one example of how Trump’s signature phrase — Make America Great Again — has become a flash point in American daily life.

This week, a 19-year-old man in New Jersey was arrested and charged with assault and harassment after authorities say he tried to grab a MAGA hat off the head of an 81-year-old man outside a grocery store. The teen threw the older man to the ground and tipped over his shopping cart, police said.

A California high school student was banned from wearing her MAGA hat on campus and is now challenging her school district in court, alleging that the decision violates her First Amendment rights. After actor Jussie Smollett claimed, allegedly falsely, that he was assaulted in Chicago by two men who said he was in “MAGA country,” Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said in an interview on “Fox & Friends” that people wearing MAGA hats in downtown Chicago would be shot in “two seconds.”

Most notably, the red MAGA symbol was part of a national debate about a January confrontation at the Mall in Washington between a Kentucky high school student wearing the hat and a Native American man."

Unfortunately, his story was allegedly fabricated, but its effect on me and on the Black community remains quite real.

This has set a dangerous precedent for the Black community, as Smollett has shown that Blackness can be strategically used for personal gain, rather than community empowerment. If this precedent is indicative of a new trend, the proud legacy of Civil Rights activists could be diminished and dismissed altogether.

Civil Rights pioneers like MLK, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin meant to empower future generations to advocate for ourselves with integrity. But, if Blackness becomes a tool for the opportunistic, the word racism will lose its meaning and consequently, Black activists will lose their influence.

In our current political climate, real hate crimes are on the rise and racial tensions are growing nationwide; the Southern Poverty Law Center tracked 1,020 active domestic hate groups in 2018, part of a growing trend that spiked circa 2016. In our current racial climate, with real hate crimes on the rise, claims like Smollett’s cheapen the Black experience in a way that we can’t afford.

One of the most frustrating parts of being Black in the modern world is our inability to effectively call out the racism we experience on a daily basis, as we’re told that we live in a “post-racial” world — meaning that racism is just a thing of the past.

Those who claim that we live in a “post racial” world were begging for a scandal like this, and Smollett has effectively proven to them that racism is no longer a problem. Now, they can use his case to claim that Black people have either exaggerated or fabricated our racist encounters just like he allegedly has.

One of the most frustrating parts of being Black in the modern world is our inability to effectively call out the racism we experience on a daily basis, as we’re told that we live in a “post-racial” world — meaning that racism is just a thing of the past.

In recent years, “polite,” passive, implicit forms of racism are now accompanied by overt displays of aggression in incidents such as the Charlottesville attacks and a plethora of police brutality cases that would take too long to list.

In light of this, Black people have to effectively call out racism wherever it exists to protect and serve our community, and, more importantly, others have to listen. Unfortunately, events such as these mean that when Black people call out real racism, our voices may fall on deaf ears.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wanted to call out the racism in subtle digs like, “You’re so articulate,” which is code for “You can speak English? But that’s just for white people! The simulation is glitching.” Then, of course, there’s the fetishing nicknames like chocolate and caramel (refer to “Finding Nemo”: Black people are friends, not food).

I normally bite my tongue when I hear these things because I think these remarks are minute forms of racism, but Smollett’s precedent threatens to turn all racism into minutiae that could be discounted altogether, just because one boy cried wolf.

In an individual sense, I’ll admit I felt kind of foolish for writing a very personal article about an allegedly fabricated story. As a Black gay man, I identified and sympathized with Smollett, and I rallied behind him when he told fans it was time to be “Blacker and gayer,” but now that inspiring message has turned into a cheap platitude.

This obviously won’t change my identity or how I express it, but I won’t pretend that it hasn’t injured my pride. Smollett’s alleged fraud dealt a blow to all those who defended him, and it will take time for both the Black and LGBTQ+ communities to process this damage and repair our public image.

Unfortunately, this news came in the midst of Black History Month, a time to celebrate Black excellence and dignity. This scandal serves as a harrowing reminder that we as Black people are responsible for carrying the African American legacy into the future, and that we must do it with the dignity and integrity that Jussie Smollett clearly lacks.

In the Black community, we have a saying: When we like or support someone they’re “invited to the cookout.” So, I have a heartfelt sentiment to offer Smollett: We don’t want your potato salad with the raisins in it, keep your dry chicken to yourself and don’t even think about showing up with that unsalted mac and cheese. You’re no longer invited to the cookout, and your Black card is declined.

Raymond Mathews wants you to remember the history of real Black activists, not opportunists.

""'One week after the incident that received national backlash, the campus has concluded its investigation of the incident,"" campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof said in a statement this week.

""Based on the results of that investigation, the department is seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect,"" said Mogulof. Once the warrant is approved, the UCPD will ""immediately"" take action to arrest the unnamed suspect.

CBN News has reported on the assault of Hayden Williams and a viral video of the attack which has received millions of views.

Williams was helping a recruitment table for conservative organization Turning Point USA when an argument erupted between two men. Williams picked up his cell phone and began filming when the violence started.

According to Fox News, one of the men knocked over the table, and then began to punch Williams in the face multiple times. The video of the physical altercation is shown below:

The suspects left before the police arrived.

President Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., took to Twitter to condemn the Berkeley police for the lack of an arrest.

""Wonder if it would be the same if a conservative beat up a leftist on the Berkeley Campus?"" wrote Trump Jr. ""Conservatives call out Berkeley police for lack of arrest one week after campus assault on activist.""

Citizen's United offered a $50,000 reward to anyone with information that can help bring an arrest to the individuals responsible.

In an interview with CBN News, Williams, who actually is not a member of Turning Point USA, but a Leadership Institute Field Rep, says he is still recovering from the incident. Williams says he was assaulted because he and other students printed signs critical of what he calls ""the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax."" Williams says the attack is another example of leftists responding violently against the free speech rights of conservative students.

""This time it was me. Tomorrow, it could be your kids, or grandkids,"" said Williams. ""So, this is a real problem that we need to address as a country.

The incident is a growing trend taking place on liberal college campuses. Multiple conservative groups have claimed verbal or physical assaults because of their views.

""College campuses have become increasingly unsafe for conservatives,"" Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, told Fox News. ""Our amazing Turning Point USA team was talking and then confronted by the hateful left which resulted in the assault and punching in the face just because of a difference of opinion. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA hat, this would be classified as a hate crime and all over every news channel.""

Guillermina Castro, a UC-Berkeley freshman serving as the organizer for the table, had left before the violence to attend class. When she returned, she became aware of the incident.

""I saw our sign ripped up, all our papers were on the floor, Hayden was covering his injured eye,"" Castro told Fox News. ""I said 'Oh my G--, what happened?'""

""He said that a guy had just punched him in the face,"" continued Castro.

She went on to share the amount of applause that came after the incident happened.

""One woman called me a white supremacist,"" she said. ""I said 'Wait, I'm Latina!'"""

Actor Jussie Smollett has been arrested and charged with a felony for allegedly filing a false police report claiming he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett, who is black and gay, had told police he was attacked by two men who used racist and homophobic slurs and tied a rope around his neck. Chicago police said Smollett paid two men to stage the attack. Smollett has made no statements since turning himself in.



No person should falsely report a hate crime, or any other kind of crime, ever. Smollett’s story risks obscuring a crucial and disturbing fact many Americans face every day: Hate crimes are on the rise. The revelation that this high-profile incident involving Smollett may have been staged is one we all should find the more disturbing because of the impact it may have on those who seek justice in the future.



Unfortunately, most hate crimes in this country rarely get the kind of attention that the reported – and possibly bogus – attack against Smollett has received. The vast majority of hate crimes in the U.S. do not make headlines. Sometimes, this is because the victims are fearful of reporting such crimes to the authorities, or don’t trust the police to respond effectively and with sensitivity. Research shows the tremendous harm bias-motivated criminal violence does to marginalized groups: African-Americans, LGBTQ people, Muslims, Jews and others.



The rare instances of false claims must not overshadow the alarming increase in hate crimes. In its latest annual Hate Crime Statistics Act report, the FBI reported 7,175 hate crimes in 2017 – a 17 percent jump from 2016. There was a 37 percent spike in crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions. Overall, 28 percent of reported hate crimes were committed against African-Americans, who remain among the most vulnerable and targeted groups.



And, these staggering numbers don’t even begin to scratch the surface of a larger problem. According to the Anti-Defamation League’s analysis of the FBI data, more than 90 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 people either did not report any data to the FBI or reported zero hate crimes. Whatever the reasons that police departments did not report credible data to the FBI, the lack of complete information risks sending the message that this is not a priority issue and makes it even harder to address hate violence.



Moreover, there still are five states with no hate crime laws on the books – Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Wyoming. There also are some states with ineffective or incomplete hate crime laws, like Utah, whose law does not currently include any specific enumerated categories and does not apply to felony crimes. This makes it incredibly hard – some say impossible – to enforce the law.



Hate crimes demand attention because of their special impact. Bias crimes are intended to intimidate not just the victim but also the victim’s entire community, leaving them feeling fearful, isolated and vulnerable.



Hate crime laws are essential because they underscore how seriously we, as a society, take these crimes, imposing tougher penalties on criminals who target their victims because of the victim’s race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other characteristics or behavior. That goes for hate crimes conducted in whole or part online, as well.



Hate crime statutes typically increase the penalty for an offense if the victim or target is intentionally selected for violence because of his or her personal characteristics. This sends a message to the entire community that hate crimes are unacceptable.



For more than three decades, ADL – working in partnership with other civil rights and religious organizations, law enforcement, civic agencies and business leaders – has spearheaded efforts to draft, pass and implement effective hate crime laws. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia now have hate crime laws on their books, based on or similar to ADL’s model hate crimes statute, whose approach was upheld unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993.



We will not stop our efforts until all 50 states have comprehensive and effective hate crimes statutes.



While the Smollett case continues to take twists and turns, it’s paramount that we acknowledge that for every case such as this, there are thousands of others that are indisputable and leave a lasting impact on the targeted victims and their communities. We must make it clear, over and over again, that the bias-motivated crimes happening every day are unacceptable.

Viral posts have erroneously claimed that Sen. Kamala Harris is the aunt of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who police have accused of faking a hate crime.

Full Story

The evolving case of Jussie Smollett — who Chicago police say falsely reported to be a victim of a hate-crime attack — has prompted some prominent Democrats to revisit their earlier words of support for the “Empire” actor.

Among them is Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who originally called the reported attack an “attempted modern day lynching.” She has since said the new developments in the Smollett case left her “sad, frustrated, and disappointed.”

Social media conspiracy theories, however, have tried to further link the presidential contender with Smollett by erroneously claiming that she is his aunt.

Before she was married, Janet Smollett, Jussie’s mother, had the same common last name as the senator, Harris, according to California birth information for Jussie Smollett. But that’s not evidence they are sisters.

Kamala Harris, who kept her maiden name, has only one sister, Maya Harris, according to an obituary for their mother, Shyamala Harris, and multiple profiles documenting the senator’s political rise.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told FactCheck.org in an email: “We have no information on Mr. Smollett being related to Senator Harris.”

Likewise, we could find no support for any familial connection between Jussie Smollett and Kamala Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff.

Some of the posts present the fictitious family allegation within another claim cast without evidence. “It’s been reported Chicago police found on Jussie’s phone records that, just before the ‘attack’, he was in contact with Booker and his Aunt, Kamala Harris,” those posts say. “Booker” is an apparent reference to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, another Democratic candidate for president, who also initially issued a statement of support for Smollett.

The posts go on to claim the alleged false attack was “Orchestrated from the TOP.”

We could find no reporting that corroborates that account. Guglielmi told us that, “given this case is now pending trial, I cannot comment on or confirm or deny any specific evidence we may or may not have.”

Kelly and the Empire actor Jussie Smollett in a revealing new interview.

Graham was speaking to Variety this week in promotion of his new solo single ‘That On That’, but the interview has since attracted attention for the startling comments he made in regards to both the embattled Kelly and Smollett.

Asked about Kelly, Graham said that the singer was “a good friend of mine” and added: “I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.”

Kelly was released from jail this week after posting a $100,000 (£76,000) bail. He also pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four women, three of whom were minors at the time. Kelly has denied all allegations which have been made against him.

Variety then quizzed Graham on his views on Smollett, who has been accused by Chicago police of filing a false police report amid allegations that he paid two men to stage a hate crime against him.

“Jussie has been misunderstood,” Graham said. “As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie.

“Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Smollett will not appear in the final two episodes of the current season of Empire following the allegations, with producers Fox taking the decision to suspend the actor from the show.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” a statement from Fox’s production team read."

Smollett’s actions have inspired countless takes from nearly every media outlet, and people are enraged equally across the political spectrum — be it legitimate anger at Smollett’s alleged actions and how they’ve belittled actual victims of hate crimes, or the type of political posturing that has come from right-wing personalities like Ann Coulter, who made the stunning claim that all hate crimes are hoaxes on her Twitter account.

Coulter may have been… joking? It’s hard to tell when someone has said so many putrid things. But make no mistake, hate is alive in well in America and it’s on the rise. Now, thanks to an interactive map created by the Southern Poverty Law Center, we know where hate groups have risen and which ideologies they practice across the country, with data spanning the last 18 years.

According to the SPLC, 2018 marks the fourth year straight that hate groups have risen in the United States with 1,020 different hate groups tracked this year, an increase of 7% over last year’s number. The SPLC defines a hate group as any organization whose leaders, activities, or statement of principles attacks a class of people, and while instances of violence are not required to be deemed a hate group by the SPLC, there has also been an increase in the number of hate crimes reported to the FBI by 30% between 2015-2017.

The hate groups tracked by the SPLC cover a wide range of ideologies across the political spectrum, but according to the New York Times, the SPLC have claimed in a statement that “Most hate groups in the US delved in some form of white supremacist ideology, like neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Confederates.” White Nationalist groups, in particular, saw an increase of almost 50%, with 148 groups tracked in 2018 versus the 100 tracked in 2017.

According to a report by the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, right-wing extremists were linked to 50 extremist-related murders in the United States last year, a 35% increase from the previous year, making it the fourth-deadliest year on record since 1970.

So when Ann Coulter or NY Post writer Sohrab Ahmari disingenuously try and posit that our current tense political atmosphere hasn’t come accompanied with violence due to right-wing extremism, that hate crimes are “bogus,” and the poisonous rhetoric coming from the right bears no responsibility — the facts simply aren’t in their favor.

Just a few short weeks ago, On the Scene along with most of the nation’s major media outlets, reported the startling anti-gay, racially charged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett. Early reports alleged that Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two white men wearing MAGA hats, yelling racist and anti-gay slurs who put a noose around his neck while pouring bleach on him. However, more recent reports from the Chicago Police Department now accuse Smollett of staging the entire attack. Eddie Johnson, Chicago Police Department Superintendent, addressed the media on Thursday, Feb. 21, 2019 in an official press conference, not only as a representative of the department, but also as a Black man and a Chicago native. “Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I’m left hanging my head and asking ‘Why?’ Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?”

Johnson went on to point out that Chicago hosts one of the country’s largest Pride Parades, proclaiming that, as a department, they do not tolerate hate of any kind in the city. After hearing the reports over the past week, my mind went in several directions. I thought about the celebrities and social influencers who used their various platforms to support and stand with Jussie, including our CEO, Crystal Chanel. Everyone from Steve Harvey to Bishop T.D. Jakes spoke out on Jussie’s behalf, offering their prayers as well as solidarity towards the issues of race and gender hatred.

I thought about the heartfelt statement issued by the Smollett family after the initial reporting. Jussie comes from a large family, where all his siblings having some experience in the arts and entertainment industry. His sister and arguably the most notable of the Smollett crew, Jurnee Smollett Bell, has made only one Instagram post since the family’s statement was released – a quote from human rights activist Malcolm X: “This is the media, an irresponsible media. It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal. If you aren’t careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”

And I thought about the barrage of social media backlash. Embarrassing memes are flooding timelines regarding Smollett’s alleged fabrication of being attacked. He is clearly the laughing stock of the community, and even Cardi B took to social media saying that the actor has ruined Black History Month. Tenured actor and Empire’s leading man, Terrance Howard, finally broke his silence by coming to the defense of his co-star. Howard shared a post on social media with the caption “We love the hell outta you.” On the other hand, the producers of the Fox drama “Empire” announced Friday that Jussie Smollett’s character would not appear in the final two episodes of the show’s fifth season.

Still, after weeding through the news reports, the underlying question on everyone’s mind is simple: Why would someone do this? Was Jussie trying to be some sort of martyr for racism and homosexuality? Is he mentally disturbed? Is he simply a pathological liar? Equally, there is no shortage of speculation on the matter. Everyone has an opinion as to why Jussie Smollett faked an assault and later dubbed himself “the gay Tupac.” The truth is if the accusations of a staged attack are true, we may never understand the motive behind the actions. It’s most likely that the “why” behind Smollett’s actions is more complicated than any one person’s opinion.

The larger issue at hand now is toward actual victims. Jussie Smollett is one man, but with expansive influence, and this case will undoubtedly have a ripple effect. Superintendent Johnson goes on to say that “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who needs support by police and investigators, as well as the citizens of the city.” Considering these recent accusations, people will be more hesitant to believe real victims, and as a society, we can’t afford that. For every woman who falsely cries rape, and every Black person who unduly cries racism, there are countless victims who fear coming forward with their truth. My concern is for them. There are real hate crimes happening. Sexual harassment and abuse are alive and well. Racism is real. Anti-gay agendas are real. It’s happening every day, across the nation, and those victims can’t afford to live in the consequences of a high-profile untruth.

Alex McDaniel claims Abel Osundairo used offensive words about gay men with witnesses claiming Abel said he could never be friends with a 'f****t', stating, 'hell no, f**k that'.

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, McDaniel said he took offense at the comments and confronted Abel which led to an altercation.

The incident happened while filming scenes for season two of Empire at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center in Chicago in July of 2015.

Abel, 25, and his brother Ola, 27, allegedly attacked Empire star Smollett on January 29, threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!'

However, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett paid the brothers to stage a fake attack because he was upset with his salary on Empire.

Smollett, 36, was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime.

Now claims surrounding the alleged homophobic attitude of the Nigerian pair casts further intrigue on the case.

McDaniel, who is openly gay, claims Abel used offensive words about gay men with other witnesses claiming Abel said he could never be friends with a 'f****t', stating, 'hell no, f**k that'

Abel, 25, (pictured) and his older brother Ola, 27, allegedly attacked Empire star Smollett, threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!' on January 29. But Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett paid the brothers to stage a fake attack because he was upset with his salary on Empire

Openly gay actor McDaniel, 38, who played an inmate alongside Abel and Ola during the 2015 Empire prison shoot, told DailyMail.com: 'I was hired to be on the set to play a gang banger for season two of the show.

'I remember meeting the brothers, the smallest one was quite well-mannered and well-tempered, very quiet and barely spoke.

'His brother who was taller was a little more agitated about what he was seeing that day.

Smollett, 36, was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime

'I swapped a few words with the taller brother. I remember we were doing a prison scene and Lee Daniels (the director), who is openly gay, asked all the guys with muscles to take their shirts off.

'I just remember his attitude being very funky and very stank like.

'They (the brothers) were moving my bag around while we were on set which also annoyed me and the conversation within the group was like, ""what if you had a gay friend"".

'It became very uncomfortable for me, the taller Nigerian guy was very agitated about the fact of me being gay, Lee Daniels being gay, gay people period, he was not okay with that notion.

'I remember he was like, ""I would never have a gay friend, I don't really like gay people."" He made it very clear he did not agree with homosexuality, he was very rude and wanted to emasculate gay men, it was offensive.'

Fellow actor Ticarus Bunch, who witnessed the altercation, told DailyMail.com that Abel went further, calling gay people 'f*****s'.

And he said the row started following a conversation about Smollett's character Jamal Lyon - an openly gay musician.

'I was a feature extra, I was a prison guard and the two Nigerian guys were prisoners,' he recalls.

'When you're on set for 12-13 hours the conversations are endless and all the extras were talking.

'I do remember the altercation. The taller of the two brothers was gay bashing.'

McDaniel (far left with Terrance Howard and other extras) added: 'It became very uncomfortable for me, [Abel] was very agitated about the fact of me being gay, Lee Daniels being gay, gay people period, he was not okay with that notion. I remember he was like, ""I would never have a gay friend, I don't really like gay people''

Bunch continued: 'It started as a conversation about Jussie actually. How Empire was a pioneer, openly showing gay characters like the one Jussie plays.

'Then it came round to having homosexual friends and the Nigerian said, ""hell no, I won't have no gay people around me, no f*****ts around me, f**k that"". He was real adamant about it.

'He wasn't talking directly to Alex but about homosexuals in general. But he knew Alex was gay so it was targeting him.

'Alex took offense to what he was saying and cursed him out.'

Bunch, from Goldsboro North Carolina, says the pair didn't come to blows but said the row 'wasn't pretty'.

McDaniel, who lives in Chicago, said: 'The more he talked the more enraged I became and I made it clear that I'm not a push over.

'It didn't come to blows. At that particular point Empire was at its highest ratings, so just the thought of being invited on set - nobody was going to put that in jeopardy.'

Bunch agreed with McDaniel that the smaller of the brothers Ola 'was more of a pleasant guy' and more 'introverted' than Abel.

A second witness Lawrence Johnson Jr, also an actor on set during the week long shoot, corroborated both men's account.

The 47-year-old said the altercation was in a holding room of the detention center.

'I heard him (Abel) say, ""I don't want gays around, I don't want gay friends, I don't like f****ts"", and that kind of stood out to me.

'Alex didn't try to hide who he was, he didn't hide the fact he was gay and the Nigerian guy didn't like it. Alex ended up screaming at him.'

Video footage emerged of Abel and Ola buying ski masks, a red hat and gloves in a store the day before Smollett reported the attack. Abel, who was dressed in a blue plaid jacket, put his hood up 30 seconds into it and then got out his phone. He appeared to type and swipe through photographs

This is the check Smollett paid 'Abel' to allegedly beat him up on January 29. He backdated it to January 23, according to police. Smollett labeled it '5 week nutrition/workout program' but the brothers say it was for the attack

Smollett was dropped from the last two episodes of the show amid the developing scandal around his alleged attack.

Both McDaniel and Bunch, who have met Smollett while working on Empire, described him as a 'stand-up guy' and said they were as shocked as anyone when the allegations against him emerged.

Bunch believes Smollett exercised 'poor judgment' in choosing the two Nigerian brothers to be his fitness trainers, however.

'To be in Jussie's presence, he seemed like a stand-up guy, it didn't seem like he was ""hey I'm big me and you're little you"", he wasn't that type of guy, just a regular good guy,' he said.

McDaniel, who still appears in Empire, added: 'I was blown away over the Jussie Smollett situation.'

Bunch, who has also appeared in TV show Good Behavior and played a gangster in Tyler Perry's, The Haves and the Have Nots, said other than that incident, the Empire set was a 'really pleasant' place to work and director Lee Daniels created a friendly atmosphere.

It's not the first time the Nigerian brothers have been accused of making homophobic statements.

Tweets from a Twitter account used by brothers Ola and Abel surfaced on Monday.

'Why you following Frank Ocean … you know that ni**a gay right,' Ola tweeted at a man in 2013.

Another tweet read: 'YOU'RE GAY THATS WHO YOU ARE.' It's unclear who Ola was referring to in that tweet.

A source close to the investigation told DailyMail.com that Smollett's defense team may be able to include the statements and details of any homophobic incidents to show that the brothers appear to have issues with homosexuality.

The tweets as well as the witness accounts go against the statements the brothers initially made publicly, however.

It's not the first time the Nigerian brothers have been accused of making homophobic statements. Tweets from a Twitter account used by brothers Ola and Abel surfaced on Monday

The tweets go against the statements the brothers (pictured) initially made publicly. 'We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens'

'We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,' they said in a statement.

Smollett was arrested last week and on Monday, a Chicago judge said the star can travel out-of-state to meet his lawyers while he's free on bond on charges he falsely reported being attacked by two masked men.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's attorneys, who say he's innocent.

Respected civil rights lawyer Mark Geragos, who's based in Los Angeles, is Smollett's lead attorney.

On Monday the star's defense lawyers asked that Smollett be allowed to travel to California and New York for meetings with his legal team.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett's character on Empire, expressed support for his fellow cast member amid the allegations.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: 'All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.'"

“Jussie has been misunderstood,” Graham said. “As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Within weeks, Jussie Smollett went from successful TV actor to sympathetic victim of a hate crime to a possible convicted felon. Once the story came out, politicians and media outlets were quick to jump on; however, at this point, the Chicago Police Department has more or less confirmed the entire rouse was a hoax to further Smollett’s career.

The incident has become quite the “W” for conservatives, at least on social media, with President Trump’s tweet on the issue garnering more than 200,000 likes. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it’s undeniable that the case has received a lot of attention from both liberals and conservatives.

And that’s for a simple reason: in such a politically divided, racially tense time, a case like this boils down to one thing — clout. But clout-chasing and politics make for a terrible combination, and Smollett is a prime example of that. In an age that is fueled by attention and clicks, it’s become a way for people to survive, and in the right circumstances (not Smollett’s), it’s a beneficial tool.

As someone in the limelight, Jussie Smollett is acutely aware that clout tokens are a viable currency in today’s age. With a family history tied back to civil rights activism — Smollett’s mother worked with prominent members of the Black Panthers and other civil rights leaders — a large portion of Smollett’s image is based on his activism.

In a New York Times interview, Smollett’s sister stated, “It makes it hard to be just an actor and to sell your soul, because you have a conscience … [T]hat’s why I say no to projects, that’s why Jussie says no to projects, and that’s why we fight for the ones that we’re told ‘no’ to.”

In other words, Smollett has always been a fighter. That’s his brand. People love that type of story, and it appears Smollett does too. In his “Good Morning America” interview after he went public about the alleged attack, he claimed that people were coming after him because he “comes hard” after the current administration. He made it a point to talk about how if the attackers were other minority groups, there would be more support.

Looking at the interview and his behavior post-arrest, we see a man who made an orchestrated attempt to be seen as a great activist, or the poster child for what activism should look like. Smollett called himself the “gay Tupac” at a concert shortly after the alleged incident took place; he preached about how he wouldn’t allow this incident to define him.

People responded well to that because a story of victimhood is one that sells. In an age where power dynamics are being called out more than ever, a story about oppression or having the big guys come after the little ones makes for impactful news.

But alas, the whole situation was theatrical from the beginning. And while theatrics are great in “Empire,” they’re not great in real life. While Smollett’s story may have gotten him clout, it was at the expense of others. While people may circulate memes and use the case as a chance to further their political agenda, this is a loss for everyone across the board.

“As everything has gone down, it’s really upsetting to see someone try to take advantage of very heightened issues in our society and take advantage of something so emotional,” Leslie Garcia, a fourth-year political science and Middle Eastern studies major and president of UCSB Republicans, said in a phone interview with The Bottom Line. “It makes me angry that he would bring something to light that had happened and make other people question situations that truly did happen.”

It’s a case where we have let extremes take over and, ironically, allowed them to cloud our judgment. Yet, all we seem to talk about is how the case can help our side, our platform, our beliefs. So now we’re here: giving a man who faked his own hate crime the clout he always wanted because deep down, that’s all we really want to do."

Graham is using his newfound fame to unleash his own music, “That on That” and he opened up to Variety about his single, his friendship with R. Kelly and his support for Jussie Smollett.

The single Graham said was made 10 years ago and his rapper son gave his approval.

“I made it about 10 years ago. My brother and my cousin Tone Bling, we were just in my apartment. Tone came up with the track and I wrote the words to it,” he explained.

“Drake was the first one to tell me, “Dad, I love that song,”” he proclaimed.

“He sent me a text message actually. [Shows text that reads “So fucking good.”] Drake heard it when I first did it 10 years ago. He had heard it before because everything that he did, he used to send to me first. And whatever I did, I used to send to him. But now he’s too busy for that, he doesn’t send me anything now.”

While Graham said the music is a hobby of his, he said he felt compelled to get his song out now because it was the right time.

“It was right. It sounded right. I went back and listened to some of the stuff I had in the archives. I ran across it and said, “Woah, that sounds good, let’s drop it!” But we had to do a remake on it because my [vocals] weren’t clear. Tone didn’t have a verse on there at first, I put him on it this time. I wanted a rapper Tone has been rapping all his life. He’s a first cousin.”

The song which talks about something peeping through the windows and blowing up his phone and doing some questionable things, is somewhat an ode to an ex-girlfriend, Graham said.

“The lyrics are not specific to anyone, it’s just something that I made up one night. Actually at the time I did have a girlfriend that was sort of like that. She was always checking my phone. If I was in the other room working on some music, she would be peeping through the door.

“Yeah, she was like that. Always calling me on my phone every time I go out. Constantly leaving messages, won’t leave me alone. [Laughs.]”

When asked about his thoughts about the pending charges against R. Kelly, someone he considers a friend, Graham offered supportive comments:

“He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.”

Even though the story was yet another example of President Donald Trump supporters getting attacked for supporting the president, it didn’t get national attention. To be fair, it had to compete with three other stories of people being attacked for supporting Trump just this week alone.

The elderly victim in this case was leaving a ShopRite grocery store in Franklin Township when a 19-year-old, identified as Ryan M. Salvagno, lashed out over the MAGA hat, prosecutors told NJ.com. The two went back and forth over the hat, briefly, before the victim turned to leave.

“As the victim turned to walk away, defendant Salvagno was able to grab the victim’s hat and the two struggled for sole possession of the hat,” Prosecutor Michael H. Robertson said in a statement to NJ.com. “Salvagno then took the victim by the arm and threw him to the ground, tipping over the victim’s cart of groceries and ultimately throwing the hat to the side.”

Salvagno was charged with disorderly persons offenses of assault and harassment, NJ.com reported.

The elderly victim received minor injuries but declined medical treatment.

NJ.com’s reporting of the assault has been factual and accurate, but their headlines have oddly downplayed the assault. They likely were not written by the author, since they differ from the reporting in the article.

The original article reporting the assault did include the phrase “physically assaulted,” but referred to the incident as a “dust-up over his MAGA hat.” Hard to say a physical assault resulted from a “dust-up,” but here we are.

In the follow-up article announcing Salvagno’s arrest, NJ.com went a step further. The words “physical assault” no longer appear in the headline, and the incident is now referred to as a “tug-of-war over MAGA hat that left 81-year-old injured, grocery cart toppled.”

Really? “Tug-of-war,” is what we’re calling it now? There’s no way this language would be used if a right-leaning person attacked a left-leaning person.

This NJ.com article was written the same day The Washington Post wrote about an assault on a right-leaning campus activist from the angle that conservatives were “enraged” about the response, making sure we all know only the Right cares that Leftists are physically assaulting right-leaning people. The Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax was the story of the month until it was shown to be a hoax, but actual crimes against conservatives are completely acceptable to the Left."

The statements regarding the R. Kelly situation are on brand with his feelings toward the #MeToo movement as he revealed in June of last year as he stated the resolution to sexual assault was “stop going to hotels.”

“No there’s not two sides to blame. You take your ass home. Don’t go into a man’s room. Don’t go where a man is, where you might think a man is going to have anything to do with raping you or anything else,” Graham told TMZ."

Kelly, Jussie Smollett, and earlier Bill Cosby, three prominent, celebrity black men, now it’s time to put the cuffs on a few others.

When I say put the cuffs on, I mean, a swift, serious, and vigorous prosecution, and if convicted, real jail time. Those ones I’m talking about aren’t black, not all male, and though in most cases wealthy or celebrities, but not all.

Let’s go through the list. Carolyn Bryant Donham. She’s the white woman in Mississippi whose infamous lie in 1955 about Emmett Till raping a white woman ended in his brutal lynching. Donham is still very much alive. She kind of sort of admitted that she lied.

This makes her an accessory to murder. There’s no statue of limitation on murder. Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, and a legion of other wealthy and celebrated white males have been accused of, and in some cases indicted for, sexual assault and victimization.

Yet they are still free. They are entitled to the presumption of innocence. In some of the cases, the accusations against them, are just accusations. But the fact that they are not relentlessly held out to hard edged public standard as the fount of all sexual criminal abuse, while Kelly and Cosby are, make the public, legal, and most importantly racial optics look horrible.

Then there are the so-called Barbecue Becky’s. This laughable appellation was slapped on white women who file false police reports on innocent Blacks. There has been a wave of false filing of these reports. The point has been repeatedly made that these racially driven, malicious reports, have resulted in harassment, embarrassment, and danger for blacks. Yet, there has been absolutely no legal consequence for the racist filer of the false report. Smollett proved that the filing of a false police report is a felony and can, and should, be prosecuted. Yet, in every case nothing.

This glaring racial double standard in how white men, white women, and those who racially victimize blacks with false police reports doesn’t let Cosby, Kelly, or Smollett off the legal and public rage hook. However, what does outrage is this seeming double standard. This reinforces several notions. One is that the jails in America aren’t meant for the rich, the famous, or white women. Another is that making Kelly, Smollett and Cosby the poster boys for criminal misbehavior is yet another in the endless textbook examples of the well-encoded grossly different legal standard for the rich and famous lawbreakers. This is hardly an example of no harm, no foul light frivolity. America’s prisons and jails are filled with men and women that are serving stretches for DUI and probation violation convictions, some long stretches.

The same double standard has repeatedly been applied to other celebrity-accused lawbreakers. Their offenses were hardly schoolyard pranks. Winona Ryder was charged with grand theft shoplifting. Roman Polanski was charged with having sex with a minor. Zsa Zsa Gabor was charged with assaulting a police officer. Sean Combs was charged with bribery and illegal weapons possession. Robert Downey, Jr. was charged with countless numbers of drug possession offenses.

It’s not just the ability of well to do white men and women, and even not so well-to-do white women such as Donham, and the false police report filers to cast their spell over a fawning public that gives them a colossal edge over blacks when they are hauled into court. It’s also their deep pockets. They can afford to hire the top legal guns, crack private investigators, and publicists. This more than levels the legal playing field for them and enables them to go toe-to-toe with prosecutors.

Prosecutors know that every legal move they make against celebrities will be intensely scrutinized and more often than not criticized and second-guessed by the media and the public. More likely they will see them as victims of a vengeful, and jealous legal system bent not on prosecuting their heroes for alleged crimes committed, but on persecuting them because of who they are.

This sentiment partially shielded Kelly and Cosby for many years from the wrath of the courts. But there was never any shield over their name and reputation. They were widely seen as sexual miscreants and had an odious taint whenever their name was mentioned. There was also never any doubt that when they were eventually hauled into a legal docket that they would bear the full brunt of the law. This will also be the case with Smollett. The same sense of righteous public indignation and outrage that Cosby, Kelly, and Smollett stir are simply not there with the other white, wealthy and celebrated, sexual ad criminal offenders. This includes Donham.

Again, Cosby, Kelly, and Smollett fully deserved to have the cuffs slapped on them. But so do the others. And until that happens then the double standard within and without the courts will remain alive and well, and always open to question.

Also, through his son's superstardom and his own musical career, Graham has rubbed elbows with some of the industry's elite. However, during an interview with Variety, Graham offered support to an unlikely ""friend"": R. Kelly.

On Wednesday, the publication took a break from promoting Graham's latest single to ask the eccentric character his opinion on some of the stories consuming the media. The first of which was his thoughts on the R. Kelly situation. At this point, that question only has two answers. One either condemns Kelly's actions completely or gives the ""I'm not the judge"" response. Yet, it seems like Dennis Graham didn't get that memo as he called out Kelly's accusors en route to showing solidarity with his ""friend.""

""He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him,"" Graham said. ""There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.""

Graham's comments come after R. Kelly's illegal activities have been exposed through various mediums. This has led to the singer being charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse that could land him in jail for close to a decade.

In addition to siding with Kelly, Graham also offered his thoughts on Jussie Smollett's alleged attack. Drake's dad feels as though the Empire actor's story is being manipulated by the police. ""Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that,"" Graham explained. ""That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.""

Like Kelly, Smollett is in legal trouble with Chicago authorities after he was accused of staging a hate crime against himself."

Attorney Daniel Barnett said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn't provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Nikki Joly set the August 2017 fire that killed five pets at his home in Jackson.

The 54-year-old Joly was charged last year with first-degree arson. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Jackson County Circuit Court, The Detroit News reported.

""We determined it pretty quickly to be an arson,"" Elmer Hitt, Jackson's director of police and fire services, said Monday. ""We investigated it over what probably was a year's time before the prosecutor ended up issuing charges.""

Hitt told NBC News reports that Joly had tried to ""fabricate it as a hate crime"" were untrue.

MLive.com obtained the arson investigation report that says gas station surveillance video shows Joly buying gasoline the day of the fire and traces of gasoline was found on his clothes. Phone records and witness statements show Joly was home around the time the fire was set, the report said.

""The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being seen,"" police detective Aaron Grove wrote in the report.

Hitt declined to provide a potential motive for the arson. Barnett said the lack of motive causes doubt in the prosecutor's case.

""It doesn't make sense,"" Barnett said. ""(Joly) was citizen of the year.""

A local newspaper selected Joly as Jackson's citizen of the year in 2018. Joly helped open the city's first LGBTQ community center, organized its first gay pride festival and helped pass a nondiscrimination ordinance.

Correction: In a previous version of this story, The Associated Press reported erroneously that police said the man tried to fabricate a hate crime by setting his home on fire. The FBI initially investigated the arson as a possible hate crime but police have not provided a motive.

The Hollywood Reporter drew attention this week to some loaded comments by Smollett published in a piece by Billboard about seven months before the infamous January 29 “hate crime attack” that captured the nation’s attention.

“Did the pressures of childhood fame or a struggling music career play a role in causing him to concoct what police are now deeming an elaborate hoax?” asks THR.

“Pusha T, Ella Mai, Jussie Smollett & More Give Aspiring Artists Advice on How to Maintain Their Mental Health,” reads the title of Billboard‘s discussion of “the importance of maintaining your mental health while pursuing a music career,” as addressed by Smollett and five other rising stars in the music industry.

“Continue to write and create for yourself,” Smollett advised artists struggling to make it in the daunting industry. “Write about yourself. Self-care is really important.”

He then got “honest” with his fans, which he stressed that he’s “not good at”: “I’m trying to be as honest as I can. I’m not really good at that,” he said. “I’m trying to come up with a good answer but I’m not good at that. I’m not good at it yet, and I know the way I stay mentally healthy is by admitting things.”

Smollett then confessed to suffering from both jealousy and insecurity. “I admit that I’m jealous, I admit that I’m insecure and that I’m not good at certain things,” he said, adding, “I’m getting better at it.”

He then made an eyebrow-raising comment about being on the verge of breaking. “I wish I had something really deep to say, but I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore,” he said. “I’m about to break.”

To help him get through it mentally, he explained that he attempts to find “joy” in his circumstances, even in states of “sadness,” “frustration,” and “hate.”

“Also for me, it’s about finding the joy in what we do,” he said. “I don’t believe in happiness because I feel like happiness is an emotion that can be taken away. Joy is something that lives deep inside of you. That’s why I find joy in my sadness, frustration, love, hate, excitement, whatever emotion I’m feeling at that moment — joy is always there.”

THR notes that Smollett tweeted on January 19 — just three days before he allegedly sent a fake hate letter to himself and ten days before the alleged attack — that “Depression is a real thing y’all.”

While there’s been some speculation about Smollett suffering from some kind of mental health and/or drug-related issue, the Chicago Police Department had a far more direct interpretation of his alleged actions: He was dissatisfied with his $1.17 million paycheck from “Empire” and believed he deserved better; the media attention would help him attain a bigger check.

In a press conference last week announcing that Smollett had been charged with a Class 4 felony for filing a false police report about the “staged” attack, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson made clear that Smollett was no victim, but the perpetrator of a crime that had already victimized others — and would inevitably victimize more.

“As a black man who spent his entire life living in the city of Chicago, I know the racial divide that exists here,” Johnson said. “I know how hard it’s been for our city and our nation to come together. How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?”

“I am left hanging my head asking ‘why?’” he said. “Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusation.”

“Bogus police reports cause real harm,” he stressed. “They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of this city.”

The real hate crimes that keep happening on a regular basis are against MAGA supporters, and no matter how many times some elderly person is assaulted for simply wearing a hat, no one will call the perpetrators what they are: hate-filled MAGAphobes.

What else do you call people who hate other people for the clothes they wear and the ideas they hold? Not only are they haters, but they are proud of it, exhibiting no sympathy when innocent people get punched or assaulted. The MAGAphobes laugh instead. “That’s what Nazis get!” they scoff. “Punch a Nazi” is their rallying cry, even if it’s an old man buying groceries. Violence and mayhem are their answer to speech they don’t like.

These are the same people, I remind you, who think obscene T-shirts — in public where your five-year-old can read them — are just fine.

The news is awash in real hate crime stories that don’t get covered on the 24/7 channels, unlike the faked MAGA crime Jussie Smollett pulled on himself that got nonstop coverage. Here are just a few of the attacks that happened recently that no one is breathlessly reporting as “hate crimes,” although the attacks appear to be motivated by pure hatred.

This one is a real hoot. What are the chances that one of these MAGAphobes is also an illegal alien who then gets deported for her outburst? You can’t write this stuff. Truth really is better than fiction.

81-year-old Trump supporter assaulted over his MAGA hat https://t.co/TLP7qS1hzx pic.twitter.com/ROrKBHQxgT — New York Post (@nypost) February 26, 2019

According to CBS News,

Prosecutors say an elderly man was assaulted inside a New Jersey supermarket after he was confronted over a “Make America Great Again” hat he was wearing. Somerset County Prosecutor Michael Robertson says the 81-year-old Franklin Township man was shopping at the Shop Rite on Elizabeth Avenue Monday afternoon when he was approached regarding his red cap. The victim was assaulted and sustained minor injuries, according to prosecutors. He declined medical attention at the scene. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.

S.E. Cupp is not waxing hysterical on Twitter over it. Neither are Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, Rachel Maddow, and any of the other usual suspects. No one is castigating the MAGAphobes responsible for these hate crimes. But real people are being harmed because they wear the wrong hat. Where is the outrage about MAGAphobic behavior? Why are MAGAphobes exempt from the public ridicule heaped on “homophobes” or “xenophobes”? Perhaps we need to establish a new identity. I identify as MAGA. If you attack me, punch me, or otherwise shame me, you are a MAGAphobe.

In order to understand MAGAphobia better, I shall use the Wikipedia definition of “homophobia” but change a few words to make it relate to the phenomenon we are seeing all over the country. I am recommending that Webster pick up this new word — and my definition — immediately. MAGAphobia encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward Trump supporters or people who are identified or perceived as being pro-America, pro-life, Christian, heterosexual, male, and/or white. It has been defined as contempt, prejudice, aversion, hatred or antipathy, may be based on irrational fear and is often related to leftist beliefs. MAGAphobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior such as discrimination (throwing people out of restaurants and denying service) and violence (unprovoked attacks either physical or verbal) on the basis of non-Democrat political orientations. Recognized types of MAGAphobia include institutionalized MAGAphobia, e.g. social media banning, and big tech-sponsored censorship, and internalized MAGAphobia, experienced by people who love Trump, but can’t tell anyone for fear of being abused. Negative attitudes toward identifiable MAGA groups (usually by the display of a red hat) have similar yet specific names: Christophobia is the intersection of MAGAphobia and Christian hatred directed against Christian MAGAs; ammophobia targets gun owners and hunters; deploraphobia targets MAGAs who refuse to conform to the prescribed political beliefs of the mass media; and MAGAmalephobia targets males specifically who are pro-Trump and is worse for those who are white (CrackaMAGAphobia).

MAGAphobia is treatable. People suffering from MAGAphobia need help and we should open a dialogue with them… after they’re put into handcuffs. Perhaps a judge should order them to wear MAGA hats everywhere they go until they stop being afraid of them. But one thing is certain: attacking people wearing MAGA hats is a hate crime and should be treated as such."

Page said she had 'no reason to doubt Jussie' when he claimed two MAGA hat-wearing thugs had beat him up and placed a noose around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic language.

But, in the wake of police claims that Smollett staged the attack to boost his salary, Page was forced to walk back her attacks on the President and his Vice.

Ellen Page has walked back on criticism she leveled at Trump and Pence in the wake of the apparently racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett, after it emerged he made it up

Page said she had 'no reason to doubt Jussie' after he made his claims, before using them as a tool to slam Pence and Trump for 'hateful' attitudes which she said prompted such attacks

'The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,' she wrote in a column for The Hollywood Reporter.

'I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on Gaycation - the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world - introduced me to many survivors of hate violence.

'I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.

'While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day.

'I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question.'

In a new column Page said the fact that Jussie invented his attack should not distract from the real hate that gay people face, without mentioning either the President or his Vice

Page is just the latest in a long line of celebrities and politicians who have been forced to retract statements made after Smollett's attack was first reported - including figures as diverse as Cardi B and Nancy Pelosi.

The revelations by the Chicago Police Department - which Smollett continues to deny - also prompted a reaction from Trump himself.

After the actor's arrest, he tweeted: 'What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?'

Page was one such figure to attack the MAGA movement, and Trump and Vice President Pence specifically, in the wake of Smollett's initial allegations.

Speaking on Stephen Colbert's show, she accused Pence of having an anti-gay agenda before saying: 'Connect the dots. This is what happens.

'If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble – you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?

'Kids are going to be abused and they are going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have travelled the world and I have met the most marginalised people you can meet.

'I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f**king stop.'"

What's the background?

Hayden Williams — a field representative for the Leadership Institute, which trains conservative activists — was helping conservative student group Turning Point USA recruit members at UC Berkeley on the afternoon of Feb. 19.

Williams told Fox News' Sean Hannity that some Berkeley students got angry at Turning Point USA's recruitment table sign that read, ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims."" The network added that the group also had a sign that read, ""This is MAGA Country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

The signs also referred to the controversy surrounding ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was arrested last week and accused by Chicago police of staging a fake hate crime against him — at the hands of Trump supporters — to advance his career.

Williams told Hannity the man who punched him claimed Williams and Turning Point were promoting violence — and then the culprit got violent himself, even threatening to ""shoot"" him, according to the video of the incident.

Here's the clip. ( Content warning: language):

What did the Post have to say?

Fox News noted that the Post's story about the incident was accompanied by the headline, ""A conservative activist was punched in the face at UC Berkeley. The response enraged the right.""

A search on the Post's website for Williams' name and ""Berkeley"" didn't reveal mentions of the attack before the paper's Wednesday story, the cable network said.

The outcry from conservatives was highlighted in the story's third paragraph, Fox News said.

""The news comes after a seven-day campaign by conservative activists both at Berkeley and nationally, who have argued, on social media, right-leaning political websites and Fox News, that because of liberal bias, the attack garnered what they perceive as a delayed response from the police and university and a muted response from the public,"" the story said, according to the cable network.

The Post didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, Fox News said.

How did others react to the Post's piece?

Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor was incredulous at the Post's ""enraged the right"" angle and the tardiness of its coverage.

""This is incredible,"" Gainor told Fox News. ""The left-wing Washington Post ignores a hate crime against a young conservative for eight days. Then when it finally chimes in, it's with the latest version of conservatives pounce. Instead of reporting the news, the Post notes how conservatives are upset and that, 'The response enraged the right.'""

Gainor also asked the cable network, ""How dare right-wingers be upset that someone got attacked on a college campus because of his politics and the major media all-but ignored it? Especially after turning repeated hate hoaxes into national news stories – like Jussie Smollett. It's also worth noting that the Post is being sued for $250 million for how awfully it covered the Covington hoax.""

RebelTV editor Rob Shimshock similarly noted, ""WaPo's first piece on the conservative punched in the face at UC Berkeley frames it around the ""enraged"" right and comes A WEEK AFTER THE ATTACK. Smh.""

Other Twitter reactions:

""The headline should be 'A conservative activist was punched in the face at UC Berkeley. The response enraged good people.' If that isn't accurate, we're farther down a dark path than I thought.""

""Put this in the 'Republicans pounce!' hall of fame.""

""Thank heavens no one smirked, or you'd have been all over it.""

""Why didn't it enrage the left? I thought violence was wrong.""

""That the Washington Post thinks only Republicans care about political violence should tell you all you need to know about both WaPo and Democrats.""

""It should enrage anyone who's against random acts of violence.""

""And you wonder why the media has no credibility.""

What's the latest in the case?

UC Berkeley police identified a suspect Friday — noting the unnamed individual isn't a student or affiliated with the university — and then announced Tuesday they're seeking a felony warrant against him.

Publicly defending either of these people right now could be considered a questionable move, but Drake’s father, Dennis Graham, has shown support for both of them.

In an interview with Variety about his new single “That On That,” Graham was asked for his thoughts on Kelly, and he responded, “He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best.

Immediately following, the Chicago Police Department stated they were investigating the attack as a “possible hate crime.”

In the ensuing days, cable news and media publications featured end-to-end coverage of the case. Smollett was met with a nationwide outpouring of support and strong condemnations of his assault. As corroborating evidence became harder to uncover, speculation regarding Smollett’s account gained traction. In response, Smollett decried skeptics and reaffirmed his account of events, an account he maintains to this day.

Shortly thereafter, Chicago Police announced that they had arrested and released two suspects (without charges) identified as Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo. They allegedly informed police investigators Smollett paid them to stage the assault, though they deny this allegation. Last Wednesday, the Chicago PD announced they had arrested Smollett on one count of felony Disorderly Conduct, for filing a false police report. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett had staged the attack and “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Supporters of Smollett have been quick to highlight the Chicago Police Department’s long history of impropriety relating to African American victims of crime, as justification for Smollett’s legal team’s statement that he’s been betrayed by the law. The city of Chicago has long been a hotbed for crime. With an estimated 241 shootings in 2019 (46 of which were fatal), many of which remain unsolved, Chicago PD has drawn intensive scrutiny for their inability to prevent and adequately investigate such crime when it occurs.

One undeniable byproduct of Smollett’s story is the attention it has brought to pervasive societal issues that are otherwise rarely addressed. Of primary concern is that expressed by LGBTQ activists who hope this “alleged hoax does not have a negative impact on real survivors of hate crimes.” In comments to the Daily News, Center for Black Equity CEO Earl Fowlkes said, “I don’t see this as being indicative of other hate crimes that take place around the country. Each one has to be judged upon its own merit and no two are exactly alike.”

According to the FBI, hate crimes increased 17% last year within the United States, with nearly 60% related to race or sexual orientation. Moreover, an estimated 42 transgender individuals were murdered in the U.S. last year. As such, the prospect of a nationally televised hoax is understandably troubling for the symbolic justification it provides skeptics and those who would seek to undermine the legitimacy and investigative efforts afforded to actual hate crime victims. Activists are concerned this skepticism will disincentivize victims from reporting their attacks, exacerbating the estimated 54% of hate crimes that already go unreported.

In the wake of such uncertainty and division, many, such as Dana Vivian White, speaker and contributor for Out Magazine, have sought to reinforce the lengths society still has to go when addressing issues of violence against LGBTQ members. “[Smollett] didn’t ruin Black History Month, set ‘us’ back, or make abuse cases unbelievable,” they wrote. “He showed me who our allies are, who will publicly doubt and disparage survivors before having all the facts, who wants to prove a point more than care for others, [and] who trusts police.”

As the facts of the Smollett case continue to unfold, two things are certain. In the United States, Jussie Smollett is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and all victims of hate crimes deserve to be believed (and have their stories investigated). To allow our culture or media to try and convince us otherwise is simply un-American.

Come with me on a journey, Jenna Wortham, to a time before you knew me. It would have been about 2010. I would say I was probably pretty depressed.

jenna wortham

My baby.

wesley morris

During this period, my best friend Matthew and his wife also lived in Boston. Her name is Armeda and she’s also my friend. And one Saturday, she was getting her hair done not far from where I lived and wanted to know if we could meet up. And I said no, I’m busy, can’t do it. But, the thing I didn’t know as I’m telling this lie is that she could see me.

jenna wortham

No.

wesley morris

With her own two eyes.

jenna wortham

No.

wesley morris

Oh, yeah. She’s like, I can see you. I’m like, I don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s not me.

jenna wortham

Oh, no.

wesley morris

This is Boston, by the way.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

I’m not in New Orleans. I’m not in Harlem.

jenna wortham

Right, you’re not in DC.

wesley morris

Not in Oakland, I’m in Boston. There’s about four black people in this neighborhood that I was living in.

jenna wortham

Dang.

wesley morris

And she can see me reading the text where she says I can see you. I remember telling this lie and then doubling down on it.

jenna wortham

Wow.

wesley morris

And then realizing, oh, Wesley, there’s no turning back.

jenna wortham

The point of no return.

wesley morris

Yeah, I had to own it. And, I just remember thinking, this is the worst feeling in the world. This is horrible.

jenna wortham

So why’d you do it?

wesley morris

I didn’t want to hear the truth.

jenna wortham

So, it wasn’t just as simple as seeing your friend, it was—

wesley morris

No.

jenna wortham

—if I see my friend, it’s going to be the continuation of a conversation that I’m not ready to have about myself.

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

And that was what you were avoiding—

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

—by telling this lie.

wesley morris

Yes. I was thinking about that lie that I maintained, and doubled down on, and wouldn’t confess to while I’m reading all this Jussie Smollett coverage. And to think about what he may have been thinking when he came up with this story that he was attacked—

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

—by two racists at 2 o’clock in the morning on the frozen streets of Chicago.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

And, I mean, at least for me, living in a lie was a stressful, lonely place.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

I wonder what it’s like for him.

jenna wortham

I’m Jenna Wortham.

wesley morris

And I’m Wesley Morris, a liar.

jenna wortham

Not anymore though, right? This is “Still Processing.” [MUSIC PLAYING] ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: OK, a lot to cover. We’ve got some breaking news. Actor and musician, Jussie Smollett, from the hit show Empire, was attacked and beaten early this morning in Chicago, and police say it could be a hate crime.

wesley morris

On January 29th, 2019, Jussie Smollett tells the cops that at about 2:00 AM two masked men, who he thought were white, attacked him. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: After the assault, police say the attackers threw an unknown chemical on his face and tied a noose around his neck. Smollett took himself to a hospital where he’s recovering.

jenna wortham

Almost immediately, the outpouring of support begins. You’ve got politicians, everyone from Nancy Pelosi to Cory Booker weighing in, saying they are offering support, wishing him a speedy recovery. You have John Legend, Janet Jackson, Ava Duvernay, tweeting photos, saying we love you Jussie, justice for Jussie. ^LEE DANIELS^: It’s taken me a minute to come social media about this because Jussie, you are my son. Lee Daniels, one of the co creators of Empire the show that Jussie is currently on, post the video. ^LEE DANIELS^: You didn’t deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called die faggot, nigger, or whatever they said to you. America is better than that. A few days later, even the President weighs in. ^DONALD TRUMP^: So. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: I wanted to ask you about Jussie Smollett. Have you heard about that story, the Chicago situation, the actor from Empire, who was allegedly attacked with racist and homophobic— ^DONALD TRUMP^: That I can tell you is horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.

wesley morris

On January 30th, investigators find this surveillance footage of two men, not of the attack, by the way, but of two men dressed in black, hard to figure out who, what they are, where they’re going, what they’re doing, or anything. But, they believe these could be suspects in the case.

jenna wortham

Right. Right. So, on February 1st, Jussie releases his first public statement. He acknowledges that there are a lot of questions about the incident, but he assures his fans, I’m working with the police, I’m in full cooperation, we’re going to get to the bottom of this, and he thanks everyone for the support. ^ROBIN ROBERTS^: The vast majority of people have been supportive. And then he goes on Robin Roberts, ^ROBIN ROBERTS^: And then as time has gone on— Good Morning America. ^ROBIN ROBERTS^: You know, it’s 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re going to Subway. ^JUSSIE SMOLLETT^: Subway’s open 24 hours. Like, people kill me when they say things like that. Because it’s like, Subway is open 24 hours for a reason. So that when you’re hungry at night, and you ain’t got no food, you go to Subway. He sits down and he talks openly about what’s happened for the first time. ^JUSSIE SMOLLETT^: How’s that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, a lot more.

wesley morris

The next day, the Chicago police investigating this case say that the two men that they see in this video have been detained and are being questioned about the incident. And they raid their house. They find some red hats. They say there’s some bleach there. And it’s looking like there’s some dots that are starting to come together. The brothers are affiliated with the show. One of them was a personal trainer who got Jussie Smollett in shape for a music video. And the brothers are providing police details about what might have gone down.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

The reason we know about this at this point, is because the police have let them go. They held them for two days without charging them with anything, And then on the 15th, the day after the Robin Roberts’ interview on Good Morning America, they then released them.

jenna wortham

So, now it’s been about two weeks since the incident’s been reported, and public skepticism is at an all-time high. All of the questions that arose in the immediate aftermath of the incident— why was this person out so late, in the middle of a Chicago winter, which we know is brick AF? And so, the things that were initially seen as holes start to widen. And, the story is not really gelling.

wesley morris

Right. But, then an amazing thing starts to happen. ^AL SHARPTON^: I among many others, when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific, and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened, and the guilty should suffer the maximum. I still maintain that. And, if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum. You have Al Sharpton, one of the most prominent people to excuse himself from the Jussie Smollett support wagon.

jenna wortham

And then a couple of days later it’s official. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: We start with this breaking news from Chicago, where Empire actor Jussie Smollett is in police custody, after turning himself in overnight. He is accused of faking a hate crime after his story of being attacked by racists fell to pieces. Jussie is placed under arrest on the charges of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

wesley morris

Well, we’re all caught up. That gets us to something like right now, but listen.

jenna wortham

There have been so many twists and turns. There are going to be many, many more twists and turns yet to be revealed.

wesley morris

But what we know now is pretty damning.

jenna wortham

I agree.

wesley morris

And I guess the question I would ask you is like, was there a moment when something just seemed off?

jenna wortham

You know, I just— I want to be really clear about one thing.

wesley morris

OK.

jenna wortham

When the news first broke, I was at Sundance in Utah, and I was devastated. Hearing that something like that has happened at such a national level, like a big name person is susceptible potentially to this kind of violence, really unsettled me. And it really just tapped into a lot of festering anxieties that I already have about moving through the world as a queer black identified person. Step one. On a work trip.

wesley morris

Yeah, I hear that.

jenna wortham

But, then the photo of Jussie in a hospital, face-timing with Lee Daniels appears on TMZ.

wesley morris

I missed that. What?

jenna wortham

Yeah, almost immediately after the report goes out.

wesley morris

OK.

jenna wortham

I think that’s for me, when the spidey sense starts tingling. As a reporter, that’s when I start to go, that’s an interesting choice. You know, I mean TMZ is— it’s usually the outlet after social media that celebrities use when they’re trying to control a narrative or control a story. It just has a very particular reputation to it.

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

So even before we get a statement, before we hear from the family, before we hear from a press team, even the network, we get a screenshot of a face-time call. And I just started to think that’s a really interesting choice, you know. And I don’t know how anyone’s supposed to react under those circumstances.

wesley morris

Yeah.

jenna wortham

It registered, but it didn’t fully land.

wesley morris

Right, right.

jenna wortham

What about you? Was there a moment for you when you were like something in the milk ain’t clean?

wesley morris

OK, so while you were at Sundance, I was at a play. It’s called Choir Boy by Terrell McCraney, the Oscar winning, co-screenwriter of Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight. And at the end of the show, the cast comes on the stage, they receive their ovation, and they read a statement. And the statement is expressing support for Jussie Smollett. And I just thought, wow, this is— I mean, these are people who could know Jussie, you know. They’re all black actors in this show. They’re all black, mostly gay identified actors in this show. And, I was like, OK, this is this is bad. This is really upsetting people, because it should. And it’s going to be a thing that we are going to have to live with and work through for a while.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

But then the next day, I got an I smell a rat text from a police officer I know, who spends some time working with cases like this.

jenna wortham

OK.

wesley morris

And some of the logistical things didn’t make sense to him. And for me, some of the paraphernalia oriented things didn’t make sense to me.

jenna wortham

All the accessories, the hats, plus the chemicals, plus the rope. It was a lot packed into a scenario.

wesley morris

And call him the n-word and the f-word, and to say MAGA country.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

Which by the way, no so-called MAGA person would ever say.

jenna wortham

I know, and also is Empire that popular among that demographic? Do they know who he is?

wesley morris

And then we find out the police are investigating a letter that was allegedly sent to him that was threatening. They sent it to the Empire set.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

It seems to me like the letter that the killer in the Bodyguard sends to Whitney Houston. Marron, bitch, you have everything, I have nothing.

jenna wortham

Which are also lyrics. I have nothing. Anyway, I agree. What was really fascinating to me in that moment, while for the most part, publicly on social media, people were just expressing support and sharing love for Jussie, all the back channels that I was on, including text with you, were raising questions. There was a lot of skepticism below the public surface, which I thought was really fascinating. At first it really angered me, but I also understood where it was coming from.

wesley morris

This is complicated, right. Like, I don’t want any aspect of this to be true, right.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

I don’t want the thing that happened to Jussie Smollett to be true. I also don’t want the lie, right.

jenna wortham

Yeah, we don’t want the lie and we don’t want the truth.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

And it was a very strange space to sit in, cognitively. Like, which is worse?

wesley morris

Right, yes.

jenna wortham

Which is actually going to be worse?

wesley morris

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And you know, while I was texting you, like talking to some friends about what was going on, I also was thinking like, I’m not going to say anything about this beyond like the four people I’m talking to about it, because the thing that kept coming to my mind was that Lincoln Memorial situation that we just went through.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

Where the kids from Covington High School square off against the indigenous elder, and the black Hebrew Israelites are somewhere in between.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

It wasn’t so much that I had an opinion that one thing was one way and then I would have had changed my mind.

jenna wortham

Yes.

wesley morris

But, I just didn’t know what I was even commenting on, right.

jenna wortham

I know.

wesley morris

And I didn’t want to feed into this idea that there’s one side over here, and there’s this other side over here, and that we’re having a moment of separate truth or separate realities. And one of the things I was also thinking about that Lincoln Memorial incident was how immediately polarizing it was.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And the thing about the Jussie Smollett thing that I found so fascinating was that it seemed to if not bring people together, I think we all agreed that the iconography deployed in his attack were bad.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

The noose was bad, and the racist slurs were bad.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And the bleach was bad. Every prop used against this man is something that nobody can stand behind, unless you are like a white supremacist, Nazi, KKK person. And so, in this amazing moment I can’t call it solidarity, but I can at least call it a kind of moral clarity, right.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

Where you have everybody from Fergie to the President being like, Jussie, this is horrible.

jenna wortham

This is horrible.

wesley morris

And I don’t know, I just, I was really struck by that.

jenna wortham

There is kind of an emotional news cycle that we all participate in as well. So, even before we really know what’s happened to Jussie, you know, my Instagram is full of— we stand with you Jussie, like let’s gather in this plaza and like raise our arms in solidarity, like this can’t stand. And I’m not saying those are the wrong reactions, it’s just we didn’t know enough at that point.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

And I do think, in a number of ways, social media has really engendered an environment within which some people tend to air out personal trauma for cultural currency. You know, a friend of mine who’s a filmmaker and activist wrote a really smart tweet, Fatima Jamal, and I just want to read it really quickly because it really crystallized some of these ideas for me. So here is the tweet. Many of you struggle letting go of woke face as it concerns Jussie, because you are indeed Jussie yourself. Someone attempting to come up, monetising spectacular realities of trauma and violence to elicit emotional responses from strangers online for capital and currency.

wesley morris

Oh, boy.

jenna wortham

And of course, with the caveat, this is not a universal statement for survivors, no one is saying that. But, the notion that this really gets at is that people do use social media for profit in not honest ways.

wesley morris

Mm— but the thinking there is that you were taking your pain and suffering and putting it on Twitter, for instance—

jenna wortham

In a performance, as a performance. It’s so efficient and effective at this point that whether or not the President feels bad— I don’t know, I don’t really have reason to think that he feels that bad, but he knows he has to say, oh, that sounds horrible because this is the climate that we’re in.

wesley morris

Right. Yeah, somebody did just like randomly ask him a question in the Oval Office and he’s like, oh—

jenna wortham

Horrible.

wesley morris

But he knew.

jenna wortham

He knew.

wesley morris

You know, in a weird way I think Jussie Smollett is one of his people, he’s a celebrity too.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And something bad happened to his race of people.

jenna wortham

Right. Right.

wesley morris

Which is celebrity. I mean, I also think that it’s really interesting that the shift that this took from being a kind of racial and sexual identity oriented tragedy, and turning into something about the truth and about lying, is really fascinating to me.

jenna wortham

Absolutely.

wesley morris

Because I feel like we’ve worked really hard to get to a point in the last three or four years, where more people are being believed, and more people feel they can come forward and talk about harm, and not be turned away, or denied, or embarrassed, or retaliated against. And I think, we’re moving into a place of believing victims and believing survivors. And now, here we have a person who seems to be exploiting all that work.

jenna wortham

That’s right.

wesley morris

If not actually undoing it, then using a lot of the capital—

jenna wortham

Yeah

wesley morris

—that we have built up as a culture. It’s not his to spend, by the way.

jenna wortham

That’s right.

wesley morris

For personal gain.

jenna wortham

And untold expenses.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

There’s been this huge discussion online and offline too about what the impact of this lie, assuming it’s going to continue to be revealed as a lie, what impact it will have, the harms it will do, how wide the blast radius is, how many damage points this will take off of the broader cause. And I don’t know, Wesley, I wonder if there is a different question we should be asking ourselves. What is it about this moment that feels particularly ripe for this type of lie?

wesley morris

We like to think we’re virtuous, and good, and love the truth, but we also love a good lie. So let’s look at a few examples of some really good lies. I mean, my favorite immediately debunked lie came from Ken Erlich, producer of the Grammys, who decided that he was going to address Ariana Grande’s not performing at the show. And basically said that she just couldn’t get it together to do her performance at the Grammys. Ariana Grande tweets, here it is, like she just found some receipts. She quotes Ken Erlich. And she says, “Too late for her to pull something together,” I’ve kept my mouth shut, but now you’re lying about me. I can pull together a performance overnight and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity and self-expression were stifled by you that I decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.

jenna wortham

That is peak receipts culture. That’s like the best thing right now about this moment in lying, or whatever. It’s like, if you are going to put a bold-faced lie out there on Twitter or just out there in the world, there is a very good chance that you’re going to get fact-checked in real time. So buyers beware.

wesley morris

Yes

jenna wortham

Liars beware.

wesley morris

Yes, yes, yes. So let’s move on to our second class of lie.

jenna wortham

Yes. The debacle known as the FYRE festival, which has been archived in two, not one, but two documentaries, in which a young, shady entrepreneur named Billy McFarland, tried to pull off the festival of the century. Roped in a ton of high-profile influencers, built a really flashy social media presence, and convinced a lot of people actually to buy very expensive packages to an exclusive music event in the Caribbean, that was nothing more than a bunch of FEMA tents and some grilled cheese sandwiches. They weren’t even grilled. Some cold cheese sandwiches. The entire thing unfolded online in real time. And those watching along at home really enjoyed themselves making fun of kids who weren’t smart enough to realize from the jump that this was too good to be true.

wesley morris

Right, there was a great deal of schadenfreude to be had if you were a person who wasn’t on one of those shuttles to the tents.

jenna wortham

That’s right. So that particular scenario is indicative of two things. One, it feels representative of how much people want to believe in a lie. I mean, that festival clearly seemed fictitious, you know? It also felt very indicative of how we as a culture like to punish people who aren’t quick enough or clever enough to realize they’re being sold snake oil.

wesley morris

The other thing that’s sort of fascinating about the FYRE festival fiasco is that it kind of still manages to make the liar a star, right?

jenna wortham

Wow.

wesley morris

I mean, Billy McFarland, he’s been sent to prison and everything.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

First of all, this is not the last time we’re going to hear from that guy, probably.

jenna wortham

That’s very true.

wesley morris

And I think that there is still a cult of interest around how he was able to scam us.

jenna wortham

Absolutely.

wesley morris

It must be some sort of talent or skill, or something. Which brings us to the liar that everybody wishes they could be— [MUSIC PLAYING - THEME SONG, “BREAKING BAD”] —and that’s Walter White.

jenna wortham

Oh, my gosh, absolutely.

wesley morris

The thrill of that show is watching somebody treat lying as a kind of diabolical art.

jenna wortham

Wow.

wesley morris

And it’s not pathological in the sense that you can’t stop lying, it’s that he manages to take a single lie about his health and turn that into just a galactic lie—

jenna wortham

Yes.

wesley morris

—that feels so American.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And there’s this great moment in the show where he and Jesse Pinkman wind up stranded in the desert. It’s too, too complicated to get into. But his wife wants to know where the hell he’s been. And when he gets back, he’s like, babe, I don’t know what happened, I was in a fugue state. Something happened and I can’t remember anything. And I just— I’ve lost my mind. So they hospitalize him. And he knows that he’s not going to be able to get out of this.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: Would you tell me about patient confidentiality? ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: It’s very straightforward, without your permission, I can’t disclose anything you tell me to anyone.

wesley morris

And he goes and sees the shrink, and he’s like hey, doctor-patient confidentiality, we got that, right? The doctor’s like, uh, yes. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: And you, as a medical practitioner, you abide by these strictures absolutely. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: Yes. ^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: There was no fugue state. I remember everything. I think we are fascinated by lying because it’s something that we all have done. Like, I’m 15 blocks away, where I’m 30 blocks away. Telling the lie that I told to my friends. But when you see somebody do it and kind of get away with it, you kind of get hooked. And our country is being run by somebody who has engendered this incredible fascination, because there is this question about how much lying he is doing.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

And how much lying he has done.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And does he even know when he’s lying, that he’s lying.

jenna wortham

It’s even causing, I think, us, culturally, to reassess what is a lie. And I think that’s what we’re talking about here. It’s all the ways in which right now people are trying to assert their version of the truth, and the ways in which it either is bought or not bought. It’s debunked or can’t be bunked— is that a phrase? But you know what I mean?

wesley morris

Yes, I know exactly what you mean. But at the same time that we have all this toxic lying, we also have what I would describe as like a toxic truth telling.

jenna wortham

Oh, my god, speak on it.

wesley morris

Toxic confessions, right? And we kind of talked about this a little bit previously.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

But you have these men coming forward and saying that they wore black-face.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

You have Liam Neeson coming forward and saying, hey, I thought about killing some black people—

jenna wortham

Wow.

wesley morris

—after my friend told me that she was raped by a black person. And it’s not so much that I didn’t want to know that, but I also wonder like, what makes you think that it’s OK to say it?

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

And what do we do now that you have? Knowing this Liam Neeson story, I just keep going back to what Jussie Smollett is thinking. And it isn’t so much that I have a motive to give. I mean the police say that the reason he might have concocted this story was to get his salary bumped up and to get some social attention.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

Which I don’t need to tell you how wrong that seems.

jenna wortham

Well from what we know too, that various people on his team, and people who work on Empire have come forward, and said there were no demands for more money. There were no asks. It doesn’t seem that that’s even the reason.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

That that’s not the motivation after all.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

But it’s interesting, Wesley, because hearing you talk through the pathology of lying that our culture is steeped in, it makes sense that it’s impossible to determine the potential wrongs of lying anymore. Like, you go all the way up to the highest position in the land, right, and that’s a person who got into office by not entirely telling the truth, and—

wesley morris

Jenna, by lying.

jenna wortham

But I’m just saying, right, like, some people don’t feel like those are lies.

wesley morris

But, some people do. ^MICHAEL COHEN^: In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no Russian business, and then go on to lie to the American people, by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. Like Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen, who just testified to Congress the other day that he lied for the president and then covered up the president’s lies. He said lying a billion times. So the truth sucks. The lies suck.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

And that just makes me want to ask, why are we so caught up in this lie? Why does this lie mean so much? [MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier, Jenna, you had mentioned that part of the reason you were so dismayed by what happened to Jussie Smollett in January was that it meant that if people were going after a relatively well-known person, what would that mean for people that nobody knows anything about? What would that mean for the health, and wellness, and safety of people who have no cultural power at all.

jenna wortham

Mm-hmm.

wesley morris

And then we talked about the backlash of his possibly having lied being so upsetting, because we’re exploiting 100—

jenna wortham

Plus.

wesley morris

You know, many centuries of harms perpetrated against all kinds of people for a salary bump?

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And so are those reasons why this lie is so captivating?

jenna wortham

I mean, Wesley, I think that this incident tapped into everyone’s worst fears about what having a Trump presidency could mean. About what it would mean to put someone into power who ran a campaign that was based on a particular type of individualism, and xenophobia, and othering of minorities and gay people. So when you have someone who lives at the intersection of some of those identities, a person who’s black, a person who’s gay, who comes out and says, I was attacked by people who support this president, called horrific names, and basically beaten within an inch of my life, it unearths a type of— I told you so— from the side of people who live at those intersections, of saying, this is what happens when you put someone into power who says they hate people like us. And so I think then, because of the way the story was unveiled, that then people on the other side of that spectrum, who have felt for a long time, much longer than this presidency, that there are people who are capitalizing on the ways their identities can be used against them, were looking for a scapegoat, were looking for a reason to delegitimize all of the very valid claims of worries, and fears, and anxieties about living under this administration, who are eager to say—

wesley morris

I told you so.

jenna wortham

It’s not that bad.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

Y’all are making this up. That’s why the stakes were so high, no matter what your position was, and now matter what side you were on in this particular incident. And the sad thing is that the reality for people who are marginalized, who are black people, people of color, people who are queer, who are gay, who are trans, is they are suffering more in this country under this presidency. The FBI said that there have been significant spikes in hate crimes, right. And, you know, the queer community online has been pointing out how many black trans people have been assaulted and killed this year, that we don’t talk about at all, haven’t talked about at all, have not gotten nearly the amount of attention that Jussie Smollett is getting. So there are real harms being caused that are going overlooked and are potentially going to be discredited moving forward, if it still comes out that this is a lie.

wesley morris

Right.

jenna wortham

So, I think that’s part of the reason is hitting home for so many people. And, if you get away with the lie there’s probably a structural reason behind it.

wesley morris

Oh, wow.

jenna wortham

For example, we still don’t know what happened to Sandra Bland. We don’t know what happened to Freddie Gray. And those are just two examples.

wesley morris

Those are two black people who went in different ways through their respective belief systems and didn’t survive.

jenna wortham

I also think that the quick, immediate national response to what happened to Jussie also exposes that color-ism still exists. The fact that Jussie is a relatively privileged, very light-skinned person, and he’s a very handsome person. So he’s got all of these additional privileges granted to him, because he happens to fall into a quadrant of a demographic that white people tend to care more about to begin with, tend to get more attention of the broader black population, in general. It also reveals something else that’s been going on with these legacy fashion houses, who keep putting out motif clothing.

wesley morris

Oh, my god.

jenna wortham

That hearkens back to our own very painful racial past. Most notably, Burberry, who had a white passing model, apparently, walking down the runway wearing a sweatshirt embellished with yes, a noose. And when people reared up and were like WTF, they were like, we’re sorry, we don’t know it was offensive. To which my only question is, even if you somehow are oblivious to the racist nature of this, have you not seen A Star is Born? Hello, mental health, hello. Like, nooses are triggering for a lot of people, not just black people. But that’s fine. But anyway, the fact that everyone understood the significance of what the rope around his neck meant.

wesley morris

Meant somebody at Burberry should have understood too, right.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

I mean it’s not just Burberry, it’s Prada, which had some racist caricatures in its window of one of its stores. And then the Gucci sweater, that if you pull the turtleneck all the way up, it gives you some really nice black face.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

So we’re at this point where the things that this case with Jussie Smollett bring up are simultaneously very specific to him. And they are much broader than him. They’re much deeper than him. They’re much more historical than him. To focus on just a little bit more of the him part, the Jussie Smollett part, watching him talk to Robin Roberts on Good Morning America just really moved me. It made me angry. It made me roll my eyes. It made me wonder why he was wearing five pins on his lapel jacket.

jenna wortham

I know.

wesley morris

I think there’s a Black Lives Matter pin. There’s definitely a pin that says love. There is a—

jenna wortham

Rainbow flags.

wesley morris

There’s a rainbow flag colored pin and there’s a black power fist pin. And I think that a lot of what we’re talking about is an actor performing something, right? And there’s just also something that just drove me nuts about listening to him say that like, one of the positive outcomes of this is going to be that he’s a fighter. He’s doing this for these young black gay kids, who need some role model to tell them how to fight for themselves. And it’s just like, well, I don’t know, sir, did you not think you were going to get caught and like all these parents are now going to have to explain to their black, gay kids why this black, gay person did what he did.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

And you know, he’s so emotional at some point during this Robin Roberts conversation, and did you feel this? I watched that Robin Roberts thing, and I felt trauma coming through him.

jenna wortham

Yeah, there’s definitely pain radiating off of him. And that pain is really relatable too.

wesley morris

I think he should be prosecuted if he did this. But I also watched this, and I wonder what is going on in your mind, and in your life, and in your psyche, that leads you to do something like this. And then, that just led me to this case that I heard about last year a Goucher College, in which this kid, named Finn Arthur, was arrested for putting up these swastikas and writing KKK along with the last names of some of the black students at the school on campus.

jenna wortham

Oh, wow.

wesley morris

And Finn Arthur is a black man.

jenna wortham

Wow.

wesley morris

But he’s a light-skinned black man. So I don’t know if he did it on behalf of the white students. I don’t know if he did it to bring attention to racism happening on campus. But it’s interesting, because both in the case of Jussie Smollett, and in the case of this incident at Goucher College, we’re still talking about racism. And in Jussie Smolletts’ case, racism and homophobia.

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

And it isn’t like these are fictional concepts.

jenna wortham

Right. Right.

wesley morris

Like, the lie is still about a real thing that happens.

jenna wortham

Oh, absolutely.

wesley morris

You know, it’s ironic, because when Al Sharpton gets off the Jussie Smollett sympathy wagon, I thought immediately about his relationship as a lawyer to a woman named Tawana Brawley. Do you remember her?

jenna wortham

Barely.

wesley morris

She was a woman, who in 1987, said that four white men had raped her and had thrown her in the trash. She lived in New York. And it became a national story of racism and sexual assault. And as it turns out, the thing winds up going to a grand jury. And they poke a lot of holes in her story. And these cases are really similar in some ways. Because she had a lot of black support, and she had the nation’s attention. And then when it turns out that she might have made this whole story up, the support sort of dries up, or it falls off, the black support, because it just becomes too untenable, and we don’t really know what the truth is, and it seems like she’s lying. And I think that whether or not those four white men raped this particular woman—

jenna wortham

Right.

wesley morris

—we know that, that lie is attached to a history of truths.

jenna wortham

I mean, all the work that Rosa Parks did before she sat down on that bus was defending women with stories exactly like that. And her book, which we’ll put in the show notes, is one worth reading. Well, we always talk on this show about the unacknowledged history that contributes and informs almost entirely this present moment. And so, it’s not about trying to armchair diagnose someone like Jussie Smollett, or even really trying to get into his mental state, or trying to find an excuse for him at all. It’s more about trying to understand the ecosystem within which all African-American people are cultivated. And understanding that there are these ties to trauma, and there are these lineages that do directly contribute to how we all move through the world, and white people too. I mean, everybody that lives in this country has this type of albatross on them. And it doesn’t always make sense the way it shows up in contemporary real time, but it’s most certainly there.

wesley morris

There’s also this question of what a victim is, right?

jenna wortham

And what a good victim is, first of all.

wesley morris

Yes.

jenna wortham

Which I have a lot of issues with.

wesley morris

There’s also, I think, if we’re talking about trauma, we’re also talking about the trauma of an actual victimhood. And I feel like we are now at this very moment, in this country, at like peak victimhood in a lot of ways. And I think there is a way that Jussie Smollett, because of the histories that we’re talking about, and the traumas associated with those histories, understands in some ways that there is a currency, to your point, in his being a black, gay man, that allows him to present victimhood as a legitimate means to be heard, whether or not something actually happened to him.

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

But we’re at this moment too, at the same time, where like these MAGA people, they present themselves as victims using almost the exact same language that oppressed peoples—

jenna wortham

Yeah.

wesley morris

—have used in this country to express their sense of injustice.

jenna wortham

Yes.

wesley morris

Or their feelings of injustice.

jenna wortham

Yes. And so, maybe the question we’re trying to ask is, how did we get to a point where this entire country is full of people who feel like they are victims of history? And what do we do with it? “Still Processing” is a product of The New York Times.

While that’s going on, President Trump’s former personal attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen will publicly testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and then the following day privately with the House Intelligence Committee.

As usual, Don Jr. dismissed the looming Mueller probe, as well as the investigation by the Southern District of New York which even prominent Republicans such as Chris Christie warn may be even more perilous to Trump.

Instead, he turned his attention to more pressing topics at hand, such as a conspiracy theory in which he believes he’s being censored by Twitter and Instagram. As an example, Trump Jr. cited a social media post that was pulled in which he commented on the Jussie Smollett case.

“I put out a tweet somewhat sarcastically hitting on the Jussie Smollett thing. Just like, ‘Man I’m really shocked that people in downtown Chicago on the coldest night of the year weren’t actually there wearing MAGA hats.’ Because, you know, if you wore a MAGA hat in downtown Chicago you probably wouldn’t last too long, OK? About two seconds until you get shot.”

“And all of a sudden I get this note from Instagram, it’s been pulled,” he continued. It’s kind of difficult to take him seriously when he can’t even keep the platform that supposedly censored him straight by using Twitter and Instagram interchangeably — but what was that he said about Chicago???

I know they seem like parody, but I swear all these Don Jr quotes are real pic.twitter.com/ETlLIHSUuZ — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 25, 2019

Oh.

If that wasn’t bad enough, Don Jr. went on to claim that “hoax” hate crimes outweigh real ones, which is just wholly and patently untrue.

Social media conspiracies and made-up statistics aside, it seems as if Trump Jr. is very much trying to steer the conversation away from the inevitable. We wish him the best of luck with that because Mueller is coming, and so are the indictments. He may just get one of his very own!

He is shown on Empire

Jussie Smollett spoke about the pressures of Hollywood and warned 'I'm about to break' in an interview seven months before allegedly staging a hoax attack in an apparent attempt to get a raise at work.

The actor spoke to Billboard in June 2018 to give young actors mental health advice.

Smollett, who maintains he did not make up the attack and insists he is the true victim of a crime despite police allegations to the contrary, told the website that he stays 'healthy' by 'admitting things'.

He warned actors not to 'bend' and said: 'I wish I had something really deep to say but I’m in my 30s and I’m trying my best to learn that I can’t bend anymore. I’m about to break.'

The Empire star added: 'I’m trying to be as honest as I can. I’m not really good at that. I’m trying to come up with a good answer but I’m not good at that.

'I’m not good at it yet, and I know the way I stay mentally healthy is by admitting things. I admit that I’m jealous, I admit that I’m insecure and that I’m not good at certain things. I’m getting better at it.'

He said that he didn't 'believe in happiness' but instead strives to live in a constant state of 'joy'.

'For me, it’s about finding the joy in what we do. I don’t believe in happiness because I feel like happiness is an emotion that can be taken away.

Smollett is accused of paying brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo (right) for allegedly attacking him on January 29

'Joy is something that lives deep inside of you.

'That’s why I find joy in my sadness, frustration, love, hate, excitement, whatever emotion I’m feeling at that moment -- joy is always there.'

Smollett is awaiting his first appearance on a single felony count of filing a false police report.

Police say he paid brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo to attack him on January 29 in what was billed as a hate crime.

Smollett told Chicago police officers that his attackers, who were masked and whose faces he could not see, called him a 'f****t', a 'n****r' and shouted: 'This is MAGA country!'"

Kelly And Jussie Smollett

Dennis Graham recently chopped it up with Variety to discuss his new single. While doing that, he was asked to give his thoughts on R&B singer R. Kelly who was recently arrested for sexual abuse against minors and “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett who was arrested for filing a false police report.

RELATED: R. Kelly Enters Not Guilty Plea To 10 Counts of Aggravated Sexual Abuse

Graham started off with Kelly, saying,

“He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%,” He said of the singer who was released from custody on Monday after posting $100,00 bail.

Graham also showed his support for Smollett who received tons of backlash after Chicago police stated that he faked his brutal attack and had two black men help him stage it. Despite what police are saying, Smollett still maintains his innocence. Graham strongly believes the 36-year-old is just “misunderstood.”

“As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story,” Graham said.

He’s not the only one supporting Smollett. Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett’s character on “Empire,” also expressed support for his friend and fellow cast member amid the allegations.

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you,” Howard said in an Instagram message post to Smollett.

They say the black, gay, openly 36-year-old actor orchestrated an assault on his person – specifically, that he paid two Nigerian men to attack him in a Chicago street at two in the morning, to shout racist and homophobic insults and even douse him in bleach and hang a noose around his neck. The cops say he pretended to be the victim of a random assault, all the while paying off his chums with $3,500 – and he would’ve got away with it had it not been a very stupid idea.

The cops swooped; Jussie is out on bail. He denies everything. The interesting question, if he did it, is why?

One easy answer is that Jussie wanted to be Jesus. It’s often said that the cult of the victim is a modern phenomenon, but it’s not: our civilisation’s greatest hero is a man on a cross. Jussie presented himself as a martyr. He said he’d been targeted because he dared speak out against Donald Trump, and like some latter-day missionary among the pagans, came a cropper because he wasn’t just different, he was vocal about it. This saint-like persecution is endured by genuine victims and claimed by the bogus, including rich, white men like Donald Trump who insist they’re the ones getting the roughest deal nowadays (they’re really not).

So I’m not surprised that someone might pretend to have been assaulted, if that’s what happened. Fakers gonna fake, and, in a way, it’s a testament to our generosity as a society that so many people’s instinct is to take the accusation seriously. If someone told you they’d been beaten up and had bleach poured over them, it would be most unchristian to reply: “Prove it.”

But we do have to exercise caution and common sense, a deference to due process – and the lack of any of these is what I found most distressing about this case. Liberal politicians and stars initially embraced Jussie’s story with excitement, showing no discrimination in the moral, healthy sense of the word: sniffing out bunkum or maintaining perspective. Ellen Page, an actress, connected the assault to vice president Mike Pence, implying that – like Brexit – the Republican capture of the White House unleashed a tidal wave of bigotry. “Join the dots,” she said. “If you are in a position of power, and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen?”

That’s not an unreasonable observation; what’s said at the top matters. But it also matters that in this instance the violent consequence of Trump’s prejudice might have been a huge con, a con that wiser birds laughed off as obviously staged. The noose, the bleach – it was as though Smollett had misappropriated an entire history of suffering for a crime plot so perfect the police instantly detected fraud, but was so fictional that Hollywood, being Hollywood, assumed it was real.

Cynics suspected all along that Smollett’s crucifixion was a performance; they also suspected his supporters were performing too, rending their garments like the hired mourners that pop up in the Bible. The holy narrative of persecution was being affirmed, and I’d be willing to bet that if Smollett is found guilty he will write himself a second series of confected victimhood, explaining why the intersectional nightmare of being a soap star in Trump’s America left him with no choice. “It wasn’t my fault!” No, it never is.

Of course pupils should never be forced to attend compulsory sex ed sessions, as the UK government would like. Not only is the parent’s right to control their child’s education at threat, but we all know that these relationships classes will become a Trojan horse for Loony Left propaganda – and where did this myth come from that sex isn’t taught in schools already? I remember 30-odd years ago being shown a slow-motion video of a family of nudists playing frisbee on the beach and it scarred me for life. I can’t even look at a frisbee now without feeling sick.

The best way to teach “birds and bees” is the classics. Not only did the Romans do things that would make Hollywood blush but the illustrations in Latin textbooks lent themselves to obscene yet highly educational graffiti. At the start of each term, we’d receive a textbook layered in years – decades – of rude doodles by bored school boys who, while the rest of the class was trying to remember the ablative form of frigidarium, had transformed a skeletal slave girl into a double D. I learnt so much from these books. Proof, if any is needed, that the classics must be at the heart of any well-rounded education.

A two-time Obama voter has accused President Donald Trump of kissing her on the side of her mouth without her consent. So, it’s her cheek, right? Well, that’s not really the most important part; it’s that this allegation has been denied by the Trump White House and the lack of eyewitnesses to corroborate the claim. She’s a Democrat, a two-time Obama voter. And sorry, but ever since Jussie Smollett was charged with orchestrating his own hate crime, it wouldn’t shock me if the liberal media continued to run with uncorroborated stories in order to get this president. We’ve seen it too often. The press is the opposition party (via WaPo):

A staffer on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign says he kissed her without her consent at a small gathering of supporters before a Florida rally, an interaction that she alleges in a new lawsuit still causes her anguish. In interviews and in the lawsuit, Alva Johnson said Trump grabbed her hand and leaned in to kiss her on the lips as he exited an RV outside the rally in Tampa on Aug. 24, 2016. Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson’s allegation as “absurd on its face.” “This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,” she wrote. Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses — a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general — denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Washington Post. […] Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, does not have a long history of political activism. She registered as a Democrat in California several years ago. She said she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but thought Trump might be able to use his business experience to help struggling black communities.

So, did Justin Fairfax’s allegations get the same treatment? He’s the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia, who has been accused by two women of sexual assault. He’s refused to resign and likened the political pressure bearing down on him as a modern-day lynching due to what he sees as a failure to take due process into account. Fairfax is right. Due process is important, and it’s nice to see Democrats see that in the wake of their deplorable character assassination campaign against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was besieged by shoddy, uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct. You see, it’s the same old game. Liberals will scuttle due process on such things, like rape allegations, when Republicans are accused, but cry “lynching” when their side gets pinched. It’s righteous revenge. It’s entertaining. And now, when you see your enemy drowning in quicksand, you place your foot on their head and forcefully push down. The sad part is I would agree with Fairfax if his party didn’t already set up the rules. He’s guilty…in the minds of the SJW mob. And he has to go. But unlike Kavanaugh, the media also eschew reporting on such things unless it’s a top Republican, like Trump, because when the Virginia dumpster fire erupted earlier this month, in which the entire governing leadership was engulfed in scandal, Fairfax’s allegation was known by The Post, but they sat on it because…the story couldn’t be corroborated.

I have been assiduously studying the case of Jussie Smollett, the chap who claims that two pro-Trump ruffians wearing MAGA hats accosted him on a Chicago street at 2:00 a.m. on one the coldest nights of the year, shouting anti-gay (Smollett is openly gay) and anti-black (Smollett is openly black) slurs at him while beating him and placing a noose around his neck. Incidentally, Smollett’s first name is not a typographical error. It is spelled with a “u,” but it is pronounced as an “e” for reasons that have yet to be divulged. Perhaps it will be in the final police report.

At any rate, after prolonged study, I am left asking, “Where does the star of ‘Empire’ go from here, and what will become of ‘Empire’?” Will the Royal Shakespeare Company ever snap it up?

Well, I am not sufficiently versed in the theater to speculate on “Empire,” but regarding Smollett, the thought occurs. There has got to be room for him on the research staff of Fusion GPS, the investigative organization that was retained by the Clinton campaign to send Donald Trump into oblivion. With Christopher Steele gone, there is room for Smollett at Fusion, and maybe, given his gifts, he could even become that fabled organization’s chief researcher. Possibly, he could even get an autograph from Hillary Clinton.

Now with Steele’s major work, the Russian dossier, utterly out of sight, Fusion is in urgent need of something with which to harass President Trump for the next two years. Not even former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe mentioned the dossier in his new book, “The Threat.” Now that Congressman Adam B. Schiff has taken over as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, one would expect that his chief talking point in the recent past — the dossier — would be prominently referred to by him and fellow Democrats. Yet there is no reference to the famously randy dossier in Schiff’s Feb. 6 mission statement. Nor has the Washington Times’ intrepid investigative reporter Rowan Scarborough been able to find any hint of the late dossier in anything Schiff has said publicly in major media. The Smoking Gun of 2016, 2017 and 2018 is smoking no more.

Fusion has to act! So Smollett’s recently demonstrated creativity arrives just in the nick of time. He abounds with wild stories that ought to keep Fusion, the Democrats and Clinton alive all the way up to 2020 and LIBERATION. His claptrap about race, about homophobia, about the menace of Trumpians on dismal Chicago streets on a frigid January night has already suckered Hollywood and Washington. All that stands in his way are the Chicago cops.

Already we know what the Hon. Schiff thinks. Within hours of Smollett’s tearful appearance in public, this giant of the House tweeted: “I met @JussieSmollett at the Pride Parade in Los Angeles, and I’ve seen the passion and moral clarity of his activism first hand. This week he was the victim of an horrific attack. We pray for your speedy recovery Jussie, and reject this act of hatred and bigotry.” Quite so!

Yet as I have intimated, there is the problem of the Chicago police and, possibly, the FBI and various prosecutors. They are not as easy to deal with as America’s credulous elites and even more credulous media. I have been, as I have said, studying Smollett’s case, and if nothing can be done to save him, he will be put away in a dark place for a minimum of 10 years, possibly more. All Smollett’s incredible creativity? Poof! It will be unavailable to Fusion GPS, to the Democratic National Committee, to Clinton Headquarters.

Jussie, though little known to me before the report of his encounter with the MAGA-hatted brutes, is obviously a member of the new Democratic aristocracy. Over the weekend, The New York Times related that his mother saw to it that he and his five siblings were “steeped” in AIDS activism, opposition to apartheid (presumably in South Africa, though possibly here, too) and, most importantly of all, the Black Panthers. I suggest his lawyers latch on to this aristocratic roots and base their defense of him on just that. Bring in other elements of it — his support for Clinton, his usefulness to Fusion, his beloved status with the entire Democratic Party. His lawyers can cite fulsome endorsements from active Democratic presidential candidates and other members of Congress. The Hon. Schiff is not the only fool.

The case can be made for Jussie Smollett that a stretch in the hoosegow is no way to treat an American aristocrat. We have not done it to Hillary Clinton or James Comey or Andrew McCabe. Let us not start with Jussie Smollett, though I wish he would spell his name correctly.

Lawyers representing Jussie Smollett, the actor who apparently lied to the Chicago Police Department about an alleged hate crime, called him a “man of impeccable character and integrity.”

Before Smollett’s tale of being of a victim of an attack by two men yelling pro-Trump slogans fell apart, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of many who vouched for his character, blamed President Donald Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such an attack. Waters said: “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on.”

This “man of impeccable character and integrity” appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” two weeks ago, where an oh-so-sympathetic Robin Roberts interviewed him. Smollett, at times tearing up, described the pain of being attacked by racist Trump-supporting homophobes. But he also described his second painful experience, that of being doubted. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black,” Smollett told Roberts, “I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett’s alleged hoax raised many interesting questions, one of which is this: How often do people lie to or about the police?

In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, with a population of approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, a follow-up analysis showed use-of-force incidents on the shifts with body cams were down 59 percent compared to those without cameras. But something else rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers — with or without body cams — were down 87.5 percent from the prior year.

Why? It was not because officers changed their behavior. They applied the same training they used before body cams. It was the civilians who changed their behavior. It turned out that when civilians knew they were being recorded, they behaved better and stopped making false accusations. Civilians — aware that they might be taped — became less confrontational, followed officers’ instructions more readily and did not engage in the kind of resistant behavior as before random cops were required to use body cams. As a result, officers did not have to use the kind of force previously needed.

A 20-year veteran Rialto police officer told me: “Newspapers make you think that the cameras made us change what we did and how we went about our business ‘because the cops were being watched.’ That’s not true. The cameras made the civilians stop lying about us, reduced the mouthing off and the kind of resistance we used to see.”

The city of Rialto is not alone in experiencing an almost 90 percent drop in officer complaints as a result of body cams.

A 2016 Cambridge University study of five police stations in the U.K. (in England and Northern Ireland) and two in the U.S. (including Rialto) found the same result. Complaints against the police fell 93 percent when some officers were randomly assigned body cams. Jayne Sykes of the West Yorkshire Police Department said: “Anecdotally, in terms of bringing offenders to justice, our Crown Prosecution Service have said to us on numerous occasions that the video footage has tipped the ballot in favor of prosecution, whereas without it, they may not have been able to prosecute. And also, again anecdotally, we’re getting more early guilty plea from suspects which saves the victim the trauma of having to go to court and give evidence.”

Barack Ariel from Cambridge’s Institute of Criminology, one of the authors of Cambridge’s study, says that in the original Rialto study, the drop in complaints against police translated into a savings of $4 in complaint litigation for every $1 spent on the installation of body cams.

In the last two years, there have been several hate crimes later exposed as hoaxes. Nikki Joly, a Michigan LGBT activist lost his house in a 2017 fire, which killed his two dogs and three cats inside the home. Two days later, the activist exhorted his followers “to be angry, be very angry.” The police quickly determined it was arson, while the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. As a result of his “plight,” the activist, called “citizen of the year” by a local newspaper, received $58,000 in donations. But a year later, the police charged the activist with setting the fire.

When Smollett’s hate crime claim imploded, Roberts called Smollett’s story “a setback for race relations.” About the assertion made by many blacks that cops engage in “systemic” or “structural” or “institutional” racism, one must ask this question: What impact do false accusations against cops play in pushing the “cops are out to get us” narrative?

The disturbing legacy of Michael Jackson

Good Thursday morning. This is a (mostly) Michael Cohen-free newsletter. By this point, the guess is you’re either fatigued by the coverage or you’re getting the spin you want from the opinion-makers you follow. It’s also a safe bet there’s plenty more Cohen news to come.

Instead, another story is capturing my attention and that’s the upcoming HBO presentation of “Leaving Neverland,” which chronicles the sexual abuse allegations leveled against the late pop star Michael Jackson. The two-part, four-hour documentary will air Sunday and Monday from 8-10 p.m. Eastern. It explores the alleged experiences of two boys, James Safechuck (at age 10) and Wade Robson (at age 7), who claim Jackson sexually abused them. Safechuck is now 40; Robson is 36.

Jackson’s family went on “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday and slammed director Dan Reed’s documentary, saying the allegations were false. That interview came a day after Reed was on “CBS This Morning” to defend his decision not to talk to Jackson’s family for his film because Reed claimed they knew nothing about the alleged abuse.

Allegations of Jackson having inappropriate relationships with minors are not new, yet he and his music remain wildly popular as we approach the 10th anniversary of his death. He is still the King of Pop, yet as Jack Hamilton writes for Slate, it gets complicated as his fans try to sidestep the possibility that Jackson might have molested children.

As Margaret Sullivan wrote earlier this week, a documentary on Lifetime had real impact on the R. Kelly sexual assault allegations. Might this documentary change the world’s predominantly positive view of Jackson, and how the media treats Jackson from now on? Up until now, and for the most part, the media has been fairly kind, or at least tolerant, to Jackson.

But that could shift. “Leaving Neverland” has allegations so disturbing and graphic that when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival last month, Sundance had counselors in the lobby for any viewers who needed psychological help. US Weekly film critic Mara Reinstein tweeted she was “sick to her stomach” after watching the first half.

Now there’s more. It was announced Wednesday that Oprah Winfrey will do a taped interview with Safechuck and Robson that will air at 10 p.m. Eastern on Monday, immediately following part two of the film. Winfrey’s interview, which will be taped Thursday before an audience that includes survivors of sexual abuse, will air on both HBO and Winfrey’s OWN network. Reed also will reportedly be included in the conversation.

It’s impossible to say what Winfrey’s approach will be, but given that it will be done in front of sexual abuse survivors, it seems unlikely that Winfrey will push too hard. Perhaps it would have been better for Winfrey to do the interview without an audience, but she shouldn’t be critiqued until the interview actually airs.

Barring reporters over Cohen?

OK, we do have a Michael Cohen mention. Sort of.

CNN’s Brian Stelter reports that several American reporters were blocked from attending a media availability with President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un early Wednesday during the leaders’ meeting in Vietnam, possibly because Trump did not want to answer any more questions about Cohen ahead of his former attorney’s Congressional testimony. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said some reporters were not allowed because of “the sensitive nature of the meetings.” But Stelter wrote, “press limitations were an abrupt change — suggesting that the president didn’t want to hear any more questions about Cohen.”

Another journalist abducted in Venezuela

These are dangerous times to be a journalist in Venezuela. On Monday, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos and his team were detained for more than two hours by President Nicolas Maduro’s regime because Maduro didn’t like the line of questioning and a Univision video of children rummaging through a garbage truck for food, Ramos alleged. That prompted a thoughtful piece from the Washington Post’s Leon Krauze about Mexico’s relationship with Maduro.

Then Tuesday, another reporter was detained. Noticias Telemundo’s Daniel Garrido said he was abducted and held for six hours and questioned by a group of unidentified armed men. His equipment was seized and he was freed without explanation.

As part of a lengthy statement that detailed the abduction, Noticias Telemundo wrote that it “repudiates this type of harassment that threatens freedom of expression and human rights. It demands that the Venezuelan government guarantees our right to inform, as well as the physical integrity of journalists operating in Venezuela, as established by international agreements and local legislation.”

A potential blow against journalism in Kentucky

The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that a Kentucky House panel wants to expand the scope of a bill that would weaken the state’s Open Records Act. Amye Bensenhaver, a former assistant attorney general who is well-versed in Kentucky’s open records and open meeting laws, told the paper, “They really want a government that operates in darkness.”

The original bill had several exemptions in the open records law to conceal information about the state economic development incentives offered to companies. The new bill would allow only Kentucky residents to use the Open Records Act. That means no one outside of Kentucky, including journalists from just over the state lines in Cincinnati, could make open records requests. Bensenhaver said the changes “absolutely horrify” her and that “they’ve taken a wrecking ball” to the government transparency laws.

New Media results

For this item, here’s Poynter media business analyst Rick Edmonds:

New Media Investment Group, parent of the GateHouse chain, reported moderately stronger financial results for the last quarter of 2018 than have other publicly traded newspaper companies. New Media squeezed out a $13.3 million profit for the quarter on revenues of $416 million, a margin of 3 percent. Print ad revenues were down 15 percent year-to-year for the quarter and 13.7 percent for the full year — not good, but not as bad as the 20 percent declines reported recently by Gannett, Tribune Publishing and McClatchy. And with growth in several specialty digital businesses, the company held total revenue declines to 5.6 percent.

The acquisitive chain has now spent $1 billion over three years and publishes 156 dailies — well over a tenth of all U.S. newspapers.

Worth mentioning

The Hollywood Reporter has a really smart piece about why Jussie Smollett might have faked a hate crime.

The Columbia Journalism Review has started rolling out “The Perception Issue,” looking at how the media is viewed.

Jenna Bush Hager will be joining Hoda Kotb as the co-host of the fourth hour of the “Today” show after Kathie Lee Gifford departs in April.

The Athletic’s Richard Deitsch continues his addictive series of sportswriters recalling the most memorable games they ever covered. The latest is from hockey writers.

Love this story from the Tampa Bay Times’ Christopher Spata about wrestler-turned-actor Dave Bautista.

I wrote yesterday how today is the last time Dan Patrick’s radio show will be simulcast on NBCSN. Now we know where he’s headed. The Big Lead broke the story — and Patrick confirmed it on his show Wednesday — that his show will aired on B/R Live, which is Bleacher Report’s streaming platform. That’s available on iPhones, Androids, web browsers and smart TV devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire. Patrick’s show also will continue to air on DirecTV.

Ask your HR director. There must be easier ways to get a salary bump.

In a dizzying turn of events, the star went from alleged victim to criminal defendant. The actor has now been arrested in Chicago and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

If convicted, the actor could get one to three years in prison and face a $25,000 fine. And a story that could have helped shine a light on a rash of anti-LGBTQ violence in America will instead give those who are uncomfortable with the topic an excuse to stay in the dark.

I don’t see how we avoid it. There are too many stories. For instance, in a case that didn’t get a fraction of the attention given to the Smollett story, a gay couple was attacked and seriously injured by four men in Austin, Texas, on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were beaten and kicked until unconscious.

If Smollett did indeed stage this attack on himself, then the actor did incalculable harm to victims of genuine hate crimes, and shame on him. But if anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable discussing LGBTQ issues is using this case as an easy out, then shame on them.

Let’s catch up. Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. He said that two men who recognized him from the show cornered him in the middle of the night. He said they yelled slurs, hit him, doused him with bleach, and put a noose around his neck — all while shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

A couple weeks later, police questioned two brothers from Nigeria, who told them that Smollett had hired them — at the bargain price of $3,500 — to stage the attack.

The stunt might have been phony, but the hatred it unleashed was real. A lot of it came from anti-Trump’ers — some of whom are running for president. In fact, @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris both tweeted that this was an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

Meanwhile, as this drama was unfolding, the audience got into the act — and tripped over its own feet. Many of those who tried to follow each bounce of this story immediately jumped to conclusions based on nothing more than their biases.

It happened on both the oversensitive left, and the desensitized right. Liberals went off half-cocked and suggested the alleged incident was fueled by the same mood that helped elect Donald Trump. Conservatives cynically used the alleged hoax as an excuse to bash “identity politics.”

If we wanted something to be true, it was true. If we wanted it to be false, it must be false. Why? Because this story wasn’t about Smollett. It was about us — about how we feel about anti-LGBTQ violence.

C’mon people, how broken are we? We’ve gone from not listening to not thinking. We see a tweet or hear a rumor, and we decide — on the spot — whether or not it’s true based on our politics and our prejudices. Case closed.

Last month, when my brother — who happens to be gay, so his antennae are up for stories like this — texted me to share news of the alleged hate crime, I didn’t buy it. The journalist in me was skeptical that white racist homophobes who voted for Trump but also watched “Empire” were roaming the streets of a Democratic haven like Chicago.

But people kept talking about the story. So eventually, I mentioned the alleged attack in a column about how it is that so many LGBTQ stories are in the news these days. And I was careful to use the word “alleged.”

No matter. I still heard from readers who were eager to discount the whole column. Days before police arrested Smollett, they had already made up their minds that the alleged attack was a hoax. Like I said, we feel. We don’t think.

Never mind Jussie Smollett. The justice system will take care of him.

Who’s going to take care of fixing the rest of us?

The broadening revelations of the lawless, almost putschist excesses of the Comey-McCabe FBI and elements of the Justice Department and the Brennan-Clapper intelligence services invite serious contemplation of how close the United States came to being a country where regime change might be plausibly and self-righteously attempted by what in undemocratic countries is generally known as the secret police.

It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United States is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95%, 97% of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers.

Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer-client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as press trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland."

""The 'Empire' actor claimed to be the victim of a heinous crime that played perfectly into Hollywood's worst fears about hate in America. Did the pressures of childhood fame or a struggling music career play a role,"" the piece whines.

That's not a question. It's what lawyers call leading the witness.

But at least the fingerprints on this one are obvious. UTA is mentioned twice in the article.

The Hollywood Reporter understandably exists in a world in which being a former child star (minus the star part) is grounds for faking a hate crime. The rest of the country doesn't.

These clumsy efforts to build a mental health case for Smollett, which I'm sure we'll see at his trial, if he ends up getting one, are insulting.

Pulling a scam to improve your salary isn't a mental illness. It's greed. And, in this case, a crime."

Kamala Harris has at times compensated for her lack of precision and detailed policy prescriptions by lapsing into prepared remarks and leaning on anecdotes to connect with audiences. | Al Drago/Getty Images 2020 elections Kamala Harris' big question mark She's connecting with audiences — sometimes to a fault.

DES MOINES, Iowa — Monica Reyes had a straightforward question for Kamala Harris: What’s your strategy to help immigrant workers gain U.S. citizenship? People like her mother, who fled domestic abuse in Mexico, sold blankets at county fairs and then opened a shop in Iowa.

But rather that diving into a detailed immigration plan, Harris asked for the name of Reyes’ mother — Brenda. “She sounds extraordinary,” Harris said. “I think it’s important in this room, while we’re having a discussion about who will be the president of the United States, that we speak her name.”

The Democrat reiterated the need for comprehensive immigration reform, then veered into generalities about immigration policy, never directly answering Reyes’ question.

The exchange at a gathering of Latino and Asian activists at the state Capitol last weekend illustrates Harris’ capacity to convey warmth and relate deeply with her audiences. But it also underscores a familiar tic for a candidate who, despite building a reputation as one of the Senate's toughest interrogators and vaulting ahead of most of the 2020 field, remains a politician under construction.

Harris is a product of California campaigns, where TV ads and name ID are king. So one of the biggest unknowns about Harris is whether she can consistently nail the retail and performance pieces of presidential campaigning — and at the same time exhibit the nimbleness and policy depth to match the very high expectations she’s already being held to.

In interviews, two dozen political strategists, elected officials and Democratic activists and voters — most of whom watched Harris’ events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — said she’s shown promise as someone who can connect with voters at an emotional level. The excitement she's generating and her profile as a charismatic, mixed-race progressive, they said, is creating a sense that she may be the candidate who best matches the mood of Democratic voters at this moment.

But in her early state debuts, Harris has at times compensated for her lack of precision and detailed policy prescriptions by lapsing into prepared remarks, turning to legislation she supports — even when it indirectly relates to the question — and leaning on anecdotes to connect with audiences.

She’s been noncommittal or vague on a range of issues. And she’s had to walk back or elaborate on answers she gave in the moment, on everything from eliminating private insurers to her response to actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged deception.

“I liked her,” said Mike McCauley, an Obama campaign and administration veteran from South Carolina. At the Harris event he attended, McCauley said he overheard people saying ""it felt like Obama again.""

“She has a sense of humor, and her laugh is utterly disarming,” he said. “However,” he added, “I thought she lacked specifics.”

Harris' launch in front of a massive crowd in Oakland and big early fundraising haul helped lift her in polls and build intrigue, which in turn has made her a major draw in Iowa and New Hampshire. At a recent event in Portsmouth, N.H., one woman told Harris she decided to come after being wowed by her CNN town hall performance.

And Harris’ delivery and pitch on the stump, a mix of optimism and fight summed up by her line “we are better than this,” has impressed.

“Her overall message is well developed,” said Claire Celsi, an Iowa state senator and presidential campaign veteran, predicting it “will resonate with the progressive base here in Iowa.”

Harris isn’t the first relative newcomer on the national scene to have to work out early kinks. Yet she’ll have to overcome a history of intermittent glitches while under the glaring spotlight of a presidential race.

“You learn about yourself,” McCauley said of the pressure environment. “And you learn how to be yourself.”

Harris, a career prosecutor whose prep sessions can be exhaustive, has improved noticeably over each of her previous campaigns in California. It’s been more than 15 years since she went neighborhood to neighborhood seeking votes in her upset win for San Francisco district attorney.

By the time Harris ran for California attorney general in 2009, she did some retail campaigning — hitting churches and barber shops in Los Angeles, for example — but it was mostly confined to occasional weekend appearances. Her reelection and Senate races were cakewalks.

In the past, she’s avoided the media and sometimes come off as too programmed. After announcing the Senate run in 2015, Harris waited more than a month-and-a-half to give her first interviews, contending she was focused on her day job running the Department of Justice.

Harris held what the invitation billed as a “campaign kickoff,” but barred media from attending the event.

When Harris did give the occasional interview, she was prone to slip-ups. For example, she wasn't familiar with two proposed Northern California reservoirs that have been a source of fighting for over a decade. And she tripped herself up by confusing a major statewide water infrastructure system known as the “twin tunnels” with the ordinary underground passageways that motorists drive through.

But the mistakes, which were minor compared with her gaffe-prone opponent, were mostly shrugged off by reporters and the public.

That changed when she arrived in Washington.

At a town hall event in California last year, Harris said “it depends” when she was asked whether she would take money from corporate PACs. She acknowledged in a later interview with “The Breakfast Club” radio show that she wasn’t anticipating the question and used the program to categorically swear off such contributions.

Harris’ presidential campaign has not shielded her from the press. In addition to entertainment shows, the senator has sat for several cable TV interviews and done a number of press gaggles with the reporters following her around. But as these early weeks of the race have shown, the openness cuts both ways for her.

In January, after Smollett claimed he was attacked by two Trump supporters who poured bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, Harris issued a tweet calling the alleged hate crime an “attempted modern day lynching.” Smollett, who is black and gay, was arrested for falsifying a police report.

Asked about the tweet amid mounting reports casting doubt on Smollett’s original story, Harris paused for several awkward seconds, appearing confused, then turned around as she looked toward her aides. Her “um”-filled answer ricocheted around social media and was picked up by cable TV talkers.

“I think that the facts are still unfolding, and I'm very concerned about obviously, the initial allegation that he made about what might have happened,” Harris said, adding, “I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

At the CNN town hall, Harris made headlines by saying she favored a single-payer health care and effectively ends private insurance. “Let’s eliminate all of that,” Harris said. She since emphasized a “Medicare for All” program would preserve private insurers for supplemental coverage.

Asked at her own town hall Saturday in Ankeny, Iowa, whether she favored eliminating the filibuster, Harris started out with a joke.

“That’s a great question,"" she said. ""Let’s change the subject!”

She made arguments that are somewhat related to both sides of the filibuster debate, including that there’s merit to upholding the integrity of the system, but ultimately concluded that she’s “conflicted.”

Said Harris: “Sorry, I can’t give you more than that right now.”

Dennis calls this a hobby, releasing his debut LP, which he titled “Kinda Crazy”. He linked up with Jamie Iovine, Jimmy Iovine’s son, to assist him with production.

In 2018, he made an appearance in a whiskey commercial for Virginia Black with Drake himself – and has been seen to also like the spotlight.

In a recent interview with Variety, Dennis talked about his new single “That On That,” as well as his thoughts on R. Kelly, whom he calls a “friend,” and Jussie Smollett, who he describes as “misunderstood.”

On the new single, he said, “I made it about 10 years ago. My brother and my cousin Tone Bling, we were just in my apartment. Tone came up with the track and I wrote the words to it.”

He added, “…I went back and listened to some of the stuff I had in the archives. I ran across it and said, “Woah, that sounds good, let’s drop it!” But we had to do a remake on it because my [vocals] weren’t clear. Tone didn’t have a verse on there at first, I put him on it this time. I wanted a rapper Tone has been rapping all his life. He’s a first cousin.”

For R. Kelly, he said, “he’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.”

Also for Smollett, Dennis says Smollett has been misunderstood.

“Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”"

Ellen Page, who came out in support of Empire star Jussie Smollett after his alleged hate attack, says she had no reason to doubt his story as LGBTQ people are always prone to such violence.

The 32-year-old actor penned a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, where she said she supported Smollett as she has encountered many such stories from the people she interacted with.

""The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie..."" she said.

In the attack, the actor had claimed that he was beaten up by the two men, who also shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

In her column, Page said it will be a blow to the LGBTQ community if the allegations against Smollett are true.

""If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes,"" she added.

Promos for the Fox series “Empire” stand out among the crowded clutter of the screen. The visual of a shattered gold vinyl record “reassembling” itself into a solid disc grabs attention like few others. It reflects the struggle of three siblings fighting for control of a family-owned hip-hop entertainment company.

That shattered disc takes on a whole new meaning in the wake of the Jussie Smollett controversy. Smollett, who plays middle son Jamal Lyon, was suspended from this season’s two final episodes after turning himself in on felony charges of filing a false police report, and staging his own assault on January 29. As this is written, it’s undecided if he will return to the series.

Not only has Smollett possibly, and irreparably, shattered his TV career, he has also shattered his credibility among the African-American community and to the gay community. In original news reports, Smollett claimed two men attacked him by shouting racist and homophobic slurs in a Chicago alley. They also allegedly yelled “this is MAGA country;” one looped a noose around Smollett’s neck, to suggest a possible lynching.

Turns out the scenario was as carefully plotted and directed as an “Empire” episode itself. Prosecutors claim Smollett gave detailed instructions to the two “attackers,” including instructions as to what slurs to yell, and noted a nearby surveillance camera would record all the action. There was one major glitch in this plot, however: Chicago Police Chief Supervisor Eddie Johnson told reporters Feb. 21 the camera was pointed in the wrong direction, away from the action.

Was this “hate crime” inspired by someone who was hateful about Smollett being black? Was someone resentful about his homosexuality? Was someone jealous of his success? None of the above. The only trouble was money. Or lack of it. Police say the hoax was designed to call attention to Smollett’s unhappiness with his salary. Other reports claim he had also sent a letter to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed, claiming he was being threatened.

Smollett is black and gay. The character of Jamal Lyon is black and gay. An attack on a popular, visible gay black man such as Smollett, especially by two men shouting “this is MAGA country,” captured on video, would give many people prima facie evidence America is an insensitive, racist, homophobic country that has grown worse since Donald Trump was elected in 2016.

Instead, the incident has shattered any credibility about the legitimacy of such attacks. The words “hate crime” in 2019 are just as damaging as the words “she’s a witch” were in 1692. And just as lightly tossed around. Hate crimes happen. Racial attacks happen. Homophobic attacks happen. But after all these revelations, whom do you believe?

Jussie Smollett has shattered the hopes of people whose only “crimes” were being born black. Or Hispanic. Or gay. Or of the “wrong” religious or political persuasion. Unlike the gold record in the TV ads, however, it may be impossible to put the pieces together again.

He now stands disgraced, seemingly discredited, charged with a felony for allegedly filing a false report to law enforcement. If convicted, he could spend three years in prison.

The police believe Smollett arranged the incident of Jan. 29, during which he alleges two masked men assaulted him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs, placed a noose around his neck and fled. His recall of them shouting “This is MAGA country!” laid blame at the White House, whose inhabitant continues to rally his supporters with the slogan “Make America Great Again.”

The most obvious question is why he would fake an attack. Smollett, in statements through his lawyers and to his Empire cast, maintained his innocence of the charge. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who also is black, said Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.” The justice system should yield an answer.

As broadcasters, columnists and public figures grapple with their responses to Smollett—first as victim, then accused—we’re more concerned about the reaction of folks he’s let off the hook.

Smollett’s claim, debunked in the eyes of many, is but an extreme version of actual behavior occurring regularly in Trump’s America. The president has empowered people who once hid behind sheets and keyboards to express their animosity publicly.

Jussie Smollett didn’t need to produce a video. YouTube has plenty that show “This is MAGA country!”-type intolerance. There’s a woman at a Bay Area Starbuck’s decrying patrons at a neighboring table for speaking “Oriental”; a man haranguing a woman in a Florida park for wearing a shirt with Puerto Rico’s flag; a woman in Southern California berating a Latino man, working in a yard with his mother, with taunts such as “even the president of the United States says you’re a rapist!”; and so on.

Not every Republican is racist. That stereotype is as bad as the prejudice we’re decrying. Our point: No one should dismiss the specter of discrimination in light of one questionable claim."

Instead of the Roman Colosseum, viewers got the House Oversight and Reform Committee in a televised hearing Wednesday. The hearing turned into a battle between Donald Trump and the Lyin’ King – Michael Cohen.

But the principle was the same – blood sport. Democrats turned Cohen loose and the anti-Trump media cheered.

ABC, CBS and NBC based their evening news programs out of Hanoi for the summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, yet all three networks emphasized the Cohen testimony and downplayed the nuclear negotiations going on in Vietnam.

DAVID BOSSIE: MICHAEL COHEN SPENDS A DAY LYING ABOUT TRUMP TO AID DEMOCRATIC WITCH HUNT

In the words of NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd, the testimony of Cohen – Trump’s former personal attorney – was ""the first unofficial hearing of the impeachment process.”

NBC anchor Lester Holt described the Cohen testimony as a “dark and damning portrait” and said Cohen delivered “a withering public takedown of his ex-boss before Congress.”

CBS went “full Watergate” and kept hyping the words ""criminal conspiracy."" “This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell described “what might be the most damaging testimony for a president since former White House Counsel John Dean testified against President Nixon during the Watergate hearings.”

ABC’s professional Democrat anchor George Stephanopoulos unsurprisingly took Cohen’s side, making no pretense of being neutral. “A lot of the anecdotes – a lot of the personal anecdotes – have the ring of truth,” Stephanopoulos told his viewers, many of whom probably recall his time working for truth-limited President Bill Clinton.

Yet Holt admitted the far more important event was the negotiation in Vietnam, which later concluded Thursday with no agreement being reached.

CBS Evening News anchor Jeff Glor delivered the typical media comparison, noting: “The future of nuclear weapons and sensational criminal allegations colliding on one unprecedented afternoon.”

And where those two collided, the press hyped the testimony over the chance to “change the course of history.”

The Washington Post’s website’s front page was focused on Cohen, with 10 separate links about the testimony at the top of the page before showing the talks even existed. The Post showed its bias, headlining: “Trump’s bid for history in Hanoi is overwhelmed by Michael Cohen’s spectacle in Washington.”

To give a true measure of media, the Post actually had its theater critic cover the testimony. Peter Marks wrote: “The Michael Cohen hearing wasn’t a hearing at all. It was cheap theatrics.” So was the media coverage.

The entire top of The New York Times site was devoted to Cohen’s testimony, along with several opinion pieces. The Times relegated the nuclear talks to one story with the uninspiring headline of: “Latest Updates as Trump and Kim Meet in Vietnam.” The story was accompanied by a travelogue of “some of the week’s best images from Vietnam.”

Nuclear weapons. Fate of the world. But here are some pretty pictures we took on our trip to Vietnam.

CNN leaned all in with 14 separate links on its home page to stories including one with the weird headline, “You need to listen to Rep. Cummings' closing remarks.” That was accompanied by an oddball GIF of an angry, gaveling Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., from the hearing. The video was just another chance for the Democrat to criticize Trump. The network featured just one U.S.-North Korea summit story.

Yet CNN also noted how the convicted liar Cohen, well, lied again. To Congress. Again. At one point during the testimony, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim Jordan quizzed Cohen about wanting to work in the White House. Cohen denied it.

CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash called Cohen out on the lie. ""He very much wanted a job in the White House,"" she said, to agreement of the panel. Anchor Jake Tapper added about the Cohen claim: “All of our reporting suggests that’s not true.”

In Jordan’s words, “Michael Cohen. Fraudster, cheat, convicted felon, and in two months a federal inmate.” Cohen even admitted he had lied to first lady Melania Trump, though the convicted liar said he regretted it.

New York Times Contributing Opinion Writer Peter Wehner wrote about Cohen that “Republicans on the committee tried to destroy the credibility of his testimony, not because they believe that his testimony is false, but because they fear it is true.” Actually, it was pretty obvious Republicans on the committee didn’t believe the convicted liar had any credibility.

Like all such stories, the media didn’t care if what Cohen said was true. They desperately wanted it to be true and that was enough. Just like Jussie Smollett. Just like Covington. And the testimony didn’t have to be true or even be delivered by someone honest. It just had to fit the anti-Trump narrative.

When the boy cried wolf for the final time, no one believed him.

Jussie Smollett, an actor, stood up to represent multiple communities when he cried out “wolf!”

On Jan. 29, it was reported that Smollett was involved in an attack where he claimed that his attackers wore “MAGA” hats and shouted bigoted slurs at him. During the police investigation of the attack, authorities uncovered evidence that suggested it was staged.

In lieu of the evidence of the alleged attack, Smollett’s cry for help may be the last that is taken seriously by the public when it comes from someone in the LGBTQ or black communities.

However, this can’t be the case. Violence against any community must be prosecuted and the gravity of hate crimes cannot be forgotten. If video evidence of the alleged attack arises, the people who committed those violent acts need to be put on trial for a hate crime, just as Smollett is being put on trial for his felony offenses.

The ongoing investigation of the Jussie Smollett case has caught the gaze of the nation. At first, this was treated as a genuine threat to the LGBTQ and the black communities with sympathy pouring in from the public. After a series of events and uncovered evidence that led police to believe the act was staged, the opinion of the general public shifted.

Now, Democratic leaders are backtracking on statements that suggested the alleged attack was a “modern-day lynching.” Trump supporters seem to have been exploited as a symbolic trope in the narrative that Smollett was attacked by men wearing “MAGA” hats. All the while, the LGBTQ and black communities struggle to convince the public that homophobia and racism are still alive and well.

Jussie Smollett was charged with filing a false police report. He paid two people $3,500 prior to the event, and now the media is reporting that his alleged attack was a fake hate crime.

This is the point where certain questions need to be raised.

There are several counts against Smollett’s judgment due to falsifying police documents and the transaction prior to the incident, but is this enough to discredit a violent act as a hate crime?

These individuals were allegedly paid to commit a hate crime, but individuals have free will. Any human with a basic understanding of right and wrong has the opportunity to act in a way that is acceptable to society; to decide whether or not to commit acts of hate.

No one forced these two individuals to perform the alleged attack. An act of hateful violence is an act of hateful violence, and there is no way of arguing against that. If the attack was carried out in the way it was described by Smollett, it is still considered a hate crime despite Smollett’s actions.

The troubling part is that there is no evidence to show that this was an act of violence, though the aftermath of the alleged attack backs the narrative that Smollett was involved in an altercation.

When it was revealed that there was reason to believe the event was staged, a burden was placed on multiple communities. The black community, the LGBTQ community, Trump supporters and Democrats alike are now struggling to reclaim their credibility in their fight for justice.

If Smollett did orchestrate this event and he is proven guilty, this will place a strain on marginalized communities who seek empathy from the public in times of need.

Violent crimes that use hateful and divisive language are punishable even if they are allegedly staged, and there is no excuse for bigoted behavior that causes physical harm."

Each passing day brings a new headache for Black America to deal with. It all started with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam apologizing for wearing blackface in an old yearbook photo, then claiming that it actually wasn’t him in the picture while admitting he had done it at another time to win a dance contest as Michael Jackson; followed by the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Justin Farifax facing allegations of sexual assault and rape from multiple women; and troll/commentator Candace Owens using Adolf Hitler to defend nationalism. All of this on top of just the general constant headache that is to be Black in America. With all this racism flying around, there is the completely predictable (and wrong) response that we live in a post-racial society and that we have moved past racism. This is wrong on so many levels I could dedicate a series of books, a James Bond number of movies, enough documentaries to put Ken Burns to shame and enough think pieces to litter every webpage. I will attempt to hit on the main points to introduce you into the discussion.

Let us start with ya boy Liam Neeson. He recently admitted to prowling around bars 40 years ago hoping a “Black bastard” started something with him so he could kill them in revenge for a friend who was raped by a Black man. He did this while promoting his new movie, which could be seen as “Taken: On Ice.” It has been followed by an onslaught of people saying he is racist, people saying he isn’t because it was so long ago and he didn’t kill anyone, and all the other same boring opinions people have when something like this happens. He even went on “Good Morning America” to further explain himself and try to save his image. Sure, he feels bad about thinking that way and wants the world to believe that he isn’t racist. However, there has been something missing from these conversations. It is the fact that the world he and his defenders say is in the past is the current world for Black and brown people. Every time I walk out the door I fear for my life because there could be an angry racist just looking to end my life because he felt like my skin means I am lesser and deserve to die. Neeson could have spent the last 40 years dedicated to fighting for civil rights, but that doesn’t exclude the fact that he knew he could kill an innocent Black person and probably get away with it as white people have done for hundreds of years. I get people grow and change, and that’s a great start to real change. But the system is larger than any individual and, despite not participating in racist actions anymore, the system that emboldened Neeson to feel like he had the justifiable right to kill an innocent Black person is still present and endangering lives on a daily basis.

Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack is also indicative of this system. Even though the situation has since become more complicated, as Smollett himself was arrested for helping orchestrate the attack, the direction of the rhetoric surrounding it before the newest discoveries was clear as day. As usual, people were tripping over themselves to make their all-too-predictable opinions known: “This isn’t indicative of America,” “This isn’t who we are America,” “This couldn’t have happened because it was so cartoonish,” “We have to wait for all the facts because we can’t trust the victim, but we can trust the Chicago Police Department.” The slow trickle of concrete facts from an organization that has historically abused Black people is not surprising. Even though no one believes Smollett, the sad reality is that, despite what people think, attacks on Black and LGBTQIA* people still do happen in 2019.

There is so much that happens to marginalized communities when they have to deal with the constant news about how they are under attack. The anxiety, depression, anger, cynicism, apathy and profound distrust in the systems that govern our society. The systems that have been temporarily put in check in order to live a semi-healthy life roar back to the forefront and disrupt everything they have built. Imagine you wake up one day, get ready for class, and see several stories about how the group you most identify with is being jailed at disproportionate rates. How you have to make up for 400 years of discrimination and hatred. How you don’t have the space or time to properly digest the reality. How people see you as less than human. In short, marginalized communities are constantly retraumatized by these events while also having to attempt and live a productive life.

So, while I am glad individual people, especially people of extreme privilege, have been speaking out more about equality, they represent the very first step in dismantling the system. We need to hold them, and ourselves, accountable for past actions. If we don’t, then this tired cycle will continue until we end up permanently ruining any chance of fixing what’s wrong with society."

Dennis Graham was chatting about his new single to Variety when he was asked to give his thoughts on R&B superstar Kelly and Empire star Smollett.

'He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%,' Graham said of Kelly who was released from custody on Monday after posting $100,00 bail.

Hours before his release, Kelly, 52, pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse against four victims, three of them minors.

Hours before his release, Kelly, 52, pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse against four victims, three of them minors

Kelly surrendered to Chicago police Friday, after a documentary series refocused attention on decades of accusations against him, including possession of child pornography, sex with minors, operating a sex cult and sexual battery.

After a dramatic trial, Kelly was acquitted in 2008 of child pornography charges, also in Chicago.

The new 10-count indictment included three people who were minors aged between 13 and 16 when the alleged abuse occurred.

Kim Foxx - the state's attorney for Cook County, which includes Chicago - told journalists the alleged crimes occurred between 1998 and 2010.

The charges carry three to seven years of prison time each.

Kelly's lawyer said the charges were based on old and false accusations, adding that 'all of the women are lying.'

In the controversy surrounding Smollett, Graham said that the 36-year-old actor 'has been misunderstood'.

'As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story,' Graham said.

Smollett was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime.

He claimed two white men cornered him around 2am in Chicago on January 29.

In the controversy surrounding Smollett (right), Graham (left) said that the actor 'has been misunderstood'. 'That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story,' Graham said

Smollett said the men threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!'

However, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett made up the attack.

Police added that they believe Smollett paid the brothers to pretend to attack him because he was upset with his salary on Empire.

Chicago police charged Smollett with disorderly conduct. He was released last week after posting $10,000 cash. He was ordered to surrender his passport.

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Smollett's character on Empire, also expressed support for his fellow cast member amid the allegations.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: 'All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.'

The post on Saturday came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move 'to avoid further disruption on the set'."

Two months in, and Baby New Year has turned into a brick-tossing juvenile delinquent.

Already there has been more wacky, jaw-dropping news than we can print.

We’ve had three mass shootings since Jan 23, but the incidents already have passed from the public consciousness like a bad dream.

In keeping with the Worst Black History Month Ever, when in your wildest imagination did you think that 10 years after we elected a black president, we’d still have to have stories on why blackface is bad?

Add to that, singer R. Kelly, whose impunity when it comes to young girls was the worst-kept disgrace in black America. Add to that actor Jussie Smollett’s arrest on charges he made up a bizarre racist/homophobic attack by MAGA supporters in downtown Chicago.

Add to that the media burning more time on Smollett than an alleged white-supremacist terrorist serving in the Coast Guard.

Add to that Virginia Lt. Gov Justin Fairfax, who is characterizing accusations of sex abuse against him as a “lynching,” because, apparently, no more inappropriate term could be found.

Not even the elegant Mahershala Ali winning an Oscar for an astonishing two years in a row makes up for this rolling disaster of a month because he earned it for “Green Book,” which people still are arguing about. As a result, history-making Oscar wins by three black women have been swallowed up in the maelstrom.

And that’s just black people’s terrible, no-good news. On Wednesday, the president’s former attorney and bag man lobbed the testimonial equivalent of Molotov cocktails as he heads off to the hoosegow for lying the last time he testified before Congress. Needless to say, it upstaged the president’s summit in Vietnam.

Give us a choice between gossip and diplomacy, scandal wins every time.

Who foresaw that 2019 would bring new measles outbreaks? Or that two Catholic cardinals once thought to be untouchable would fall like bowling pins over sex crimes against children, along with the news that dozens of Southern Baptist clergy and laymen convicted of sex crimes were allowed to continue working in churches?

That people would be obsessed with freshman congresswomen who have no real clout, all while ignoring what the experienced ones actually are doing?

Who would believe that Jon Stewart, a comedian, would have to prod and shame Congress into doing its job in extending benefits to first responders affected by the Sept. 11 terror attacks?

Who among us predicted that in 2019 the richest guy on the planet would be threatened with blackmail after someone stole pictures he took of his, ahem, in a scandal tied to the Saudi government’s cover-up in the murder of a Washington Post journalist?

Who knew that three weeks after winning his sixth Super Bowl ring, an NFL team owner would be caught in a sex ring sting? If anything good is to be had here, the charge puts human trafficking in a place where we no longer can ignore it.

Winter, traditionally, has been the time of year when journalists have had to scramble for news that isn’t weather-related. But 2019 has come out of the gate like a Brahman bull, daring us to try to hang on.

Most recently, the Jussie Smollett assault hoax captivated the nation as the purported hate crime was embraced as hard news by many media outlets around the country.

The details in Smollett’s account brought suspicion to its veracity immediately for anybody willing to look at the story on its merits, but for too many, their confirmation bias nudged it into the “true” category prematurely. For a rather thin and flawed tale, the Smollett “assault” gained a lot of mileage in this country.

ALSO READ: Man, 19, accused of assaulting 81-year-old over MAGA hat

Rarely are the stories of assaults against Trump supporters reported on with such fervor. They may get cursory attention from local outlets and perhaps a nod from a national organization, but there is almost never a national media firestorm over such events.

In the last few weeks, two such cases have come to light.

First, a young man wearing a MAGA hat in Falmouth was allegedly assaulted by a woman in a Mexican restaurant. The incident was caught on video. In it, Rosiane Santos, 41, is seen pulling 23-year-old Bryton Turner’s hat over his face and taunting him. Turner told the Herald that Santos confronted him in the restaurant right away. Santos was arrested Feb. 15 for assault and battery and disorderly conduct.

The Herald’s Howie Carr later reported that Santos was taken into ICE custody because she was a citizen of Brazil and had overstayed her tourist visa in 1994.

This week, another man was assaulted in another blue state. Prosecutors in Franklin Township, N.J., say an 81-year-old man was assaulted inside a supermarket because he was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. He sustained minor injuries and authorities are looking for a suspect.

Neither of these stories became the focus of the national media, though both would surely be considered “newsy” in any newsroom in any other era. But this is the era of Trump, and the narrative has been set by the activist media: President Trump has swept in a wave of violence.

No other narrative will be considered.

The truth is that Trump supporters have been the victims of violence since the campaign began.

On June 3, 2016, a Washington Post headline read, “Ugly, bloody scenes in San Jose as protesters attack Trump supporters outside rally.” The article recounts that, “Protesters jumped on cars, pelted Trump supporters with eggs and water balloons, snatched signs and stole ‘Make America Great’ hats off supporters’ heads before burning the hats and snapping selfies with the charred remains. Several people were caught on camera punching Trump supporters.”

Videos surfaced showing men and women being assaulted, trapped like rats by their assailants.

Had the victims been Hillary supporters we can imagine what the media coverage would have been like. Strangely, though, these events never seem to receive the wall-to-wall coverage or launch the “national conversation” that the Smollett case did. Indeed, we would wager that few people remember the incident.

Attacks against Trump supporters are all over Twitter and Youtube and are just a Google search away. We understand the national media consider themselves this president’s opposition, but their lack of balanced coverage degrades their credibility and misinforms the public. Maybe instead of getting together to editorialize against President Trump, they could resolve to do better."

I’ve finally come up with a fair methodology for answering this question that’s at the heart of the National Conversation we are finally having on just how honest is the purported White Terror we’ve been hearing about since 2016.

The New York Times, for example, in a rare admission that fake hate even exists, recently reassured its shaken readers:

Despite the headlines that have dominated the news cycle since, fake hate crime reports are uncommon. Hoaxes are not tracked formally, but the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said that of an estimated 21,000 hate crime cases between 2016 and 2018, fewer than 50 reports were found to be false. The center believes that less than 1 percent of all reported hate crimes are false.

In other words, the Times assumes, the burden of proof should be on their skeptics, not on them. Amazon.com $50 Gift Ca... Best Price: null Buy New $50.00 (as of 11:50 EST - Details)

On the other hand, those of us of a less credulous turn of mind long ago noticed that a striking percentage of the hate stories that the national media obsesses over don’t quite pan out. Many aren’t full-blown false-flag conspiracies like Jussie’s, but the facts, when finally revealed, often don’t support The Narrative of White Hate.

Hoaxes as elaborate as the Empire TV star’s are rare, but it’s hardly uncommon for, say, the perpetrator to turn out to be nonwhite, or the act, such as posting a flyer mentioning “It’s okay to be white,” to be not (yet, at least) a crime, or for the motives to be murkier than you’d imagine from reading Southern Poverty Law Center fund-raising junk mail.

Egged on by the moneyed SPLC (endowment recently up to $432.7 million), the prestige press in late 2016 launched a vast campaign of hate about how hateful straight white male Trump voters were carrying out countless hate crimes against minorities.

But what percentage of these press allegations have since been validated?

The methodological issue is, how do we keep advocates from memory-holing contrary data?

My solution is to use The New York Times’ own “This Week in Hate” columns. I let the pinnacle of Establishment respectability take their best shot, curating their own list of hate crimes from across the country. I then evaluate how The New York Times did.

On Nov. 29, 2016, the NYT began running “This Week in Hate” under the announcement:

This Week in Hate tracks hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of Donald Trump. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups are keeping detailed counts of harassment and abuse. We will regularly present a selection of incidents to show the scope of the problem.

Keep in mind that The New York Times didn’t try to be fair in selecting items for its “This Week in Hate” column. For example, the mob of leftist ski-bum Middlebury students who attacked Charles Murray and put a woman professor in the hospital didn’t qualify. Nor did the Berkeley Antifa assault on a female fan of Milo Yiannopoulos. And philosophy instructor Eric Clanton banging seven Trump supporters on the noggin with his heavy bike lock never made “This Week in Hate.” Amazon.com Gift Card i... Best Price: null Buy New $15.00 (as of 03:50 EST - Details)

No, the contents of “This Week in Hate” were instead chosen to make it appear that pro-Trump whites were running amok.

With the advantage of hindsight, how well did the NYT do at its self-assigned task?

For the purposes of this essay, I analyzed all 21 incidents in the second (12/6/16) and third (12/13/16) weeks of “This Week in Hate,” looking for pro and con evidence that has accumulated in the 26 months since on the validity of the NYT’s accounts. (I skipped the first week, assuming it was better to let the NYT get into its stride. I encourage other researchers to check out the rest of “This Week in Hate,” which finally petered out in July 2017.)

How many of the 21 incidents have resulted in hate-crime convictions? How many have been shown to be a complete hoax? How many are unconfirmed by the justice system but seem plausible? How many unconfirmed occurrences are dubious?

I shall count through the 21 cases from the most valid to the most embarrassing for the NYT.

Fox TV drama “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett plays on the show the gay character Jamal Lyon. In real life, Smollett is an African American gay male. Smollett has been charged with concocting an elaborate racist and homophobic assault against him. Smollett’s fan base, needless to say, is flummoxed. So, too, are many Americans trying to push through this deeply polarized moment.

The big question now is how Smollett’s case will affect public perception of hate crimes, especially impacting people of color and LGBTQ communities?

“Jussie has essentially set back the progression of both black folk and the LGBTQ community all while playing right into the hands of MAGA,” one online comment stated.

First hearing the story, Smollett had a groundswell of support. Smollett said he was assaulted by two men outside of Subway in the wee hours of the morning who shouted “This is MAGA country” and they put a noose around his neck. The investigation has disclosed the following: Smollett knew the two men who are Nigerian-Americans, one has appeared on the show Empire, the rope to make the noose was bought at a nearby hardware store, and the bruises on his face and body were self-inflicted, and Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to attack him. However, new evidence reveals that Smollett’s payment according to what he wrote on the memo line of the check was for a workout and nutrition program.

Smollett is now an unreliable narrator of his attack who intentionally has made himself a fictitious victim. I ‘ve been asking myself the same question as Chicago Chief police, Eddie Johnson asked during his press conference, bringing the public up-to-date on Smollett’s case: “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make a false accusation?”

Smollett’s hoax dredges up the country’s horrors of lynching and gay bashing. For me, three hate crime incidents came to my mind immediately as an African American lesbian. Emmett Till, James Byrd, and Matthew Shepard.

Emmett Till was lynched in Money, Mississippi in 1955 and James Byrd in Jasper, Texas in 1998. Byrd’s killing was called a “lynching -by- dragging.” Matthew Shepard was gay- bashed to death in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998. I give thanks to President Obama signing into law in 2009 the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, also known as the Matthew Shepard Act.

Nonetheless, Smollett is innocent in the eyes of many American Americans- straight and LGBTQ.

""I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility?” “Selma” film director Ava DuVernay wrote in a tweet. “That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Despite the many inconsistencies and gaping holes in Smollett’s story, there are communities of people of color in urban cities that have every reason not to trust the police findings, especially the Chicago PD, a city still recovering from the wounds of the coverup shooting for Laquan McDonald. In 2014, McDonald, 17, was fatally shot sixteen times by white Chicago police Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke reported his life was in danger because McDonald was packing a small knife with a blade. Van Dyke’s report was backed up by his fellow officers. However, when the police dash-cam video was released of the shooting, McDonald was walking away when shot.

In many of these communities, Smollett is perceived to be innocent, and his chances of getting a fair trial are not possible. Smollett will be seen as another victim heading toward the country’s industrial prison complex which disproportionately incarcerates black and brown men of color.

Smollett’s hate crime will regrettably affect public perception of hate crimes but shouldn’t. However, there has been an uptick of bias-related incidents and hate crimes since Trump has taken office. We have seen a rash of white people calling the cops on blacks, synagogues defaced, and 11 worshippers killed in Pittsburgh. Smollett’s hoax no doubt has tapped into our fears about our safety and our concerns of a country so polarized that we are imploding.

However, all reports of hate crimes should be taken seriously. One hoax is no excuse for law enforcement not to do their job and see each case as a separate incident irrespective of the court of opinion.

The belief that Smollett’s actions make it bad for people of color and LGBTQs to come forth in the future with their reports of hate crimes buys too easily into the notion that “one bad apple spoils the whole bunch.” Such a belief, in and of itself, is bias, suggesting people of color and LGBTQs are a monolith, and all perpetrate hoaxes.

When whites call cops on black people for “being black,” each case is handled individually, although the police might have suspicion for the real nature of the call.

In the court of opinion, Smollett is guilty. However, if in the court of law, Smollett is found guilty, he does not fully grasp the magnitude of both his lie and crime. His actions dishonor black activist and journalist Ida B. Wells’s Anti-Lynching Campaign that took afoot in the 1890s. This year will be the eightieth anniversary of Billy Holiday ’s recording of “Strange Fruit,” a protest song against lynching. And, just last year, the National Lynching Memorial opened to remember and honor the lives of men and women who were victims. Sadly, in 2019, the Senate is still trying to pass legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime.

Smollett may well have suckered us all. However, to not take each report of a hate crime seriously, because of his fraudulent actions, would be a crime, too.

The country listened in horror as “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett released news that he had been the victim of a vicious hate crime. He claimed that two individuals approached him, hit him, poured chemicals on his face and hung a noose around his neck, all while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, as well as chanting “MAGA country.” Things quickly took a turn when Smollett was charged with a felony for filing a false police report and turned himself in to the Chicago Police Department on Feb. 21.

After both the Chicago PD and FBI began investigating the alleged hate crime, two brothers were arrested as persons of interest. The two stated that Smollett, whom they knew through a personal training partnership, paid them to stage the attack.

Speculation as to what prompted Smollett to stage the attack has ranged all the way from dissatisfaction with salary to being upset with the lack of response when he received a threatening letter just a week before the alleged attack.

The way this story has unfolded is strange, to say the least. The story went from horrific attack to shameful hoax at breakneck speed. Investigations are still in progress, but even I have to admit that as more details are released, things are looking worse for Smollett. Smollett being found guilty would raise an immense number of issues.

Whether he was upset about his salary or had concerns about his safety, this was the absolute worst way to go about addressing his problems. Furthering your own personal position at the expense of marginalized groups is unacceptable, even if you are a member of said groups. Not only do Smollett’s actions hone in on the already hateful spotlight often placed on LGBTQ individuals of color, I can guarantee that his case will be used as a tool to place doubt on survivors of real hate crimes. What he did will make things so much harder for everyone else. Perhaps the worst part of the situation is that he likely knew how the public would react; he played on people’s fears and the current political climate to further the coverage of the story.

If the allegations are true, Smollett used his personal identity as a biracial gay man to his advantage. Maybe he felt that being a celebrity would give him a parachute that separates him from others, but that is not the case. Everyone is made up of different characteristics and identities, all of which play a role in defining us — but that is only a part of the truth. While there is so much about us that isn’t defined by race, sexual orientation or gender identity, there is no part of your identity that allows you to have a “free pass” when it comes to discrimination. You can be LGBTQ and be racist; you can be a person of color and be transphobic; you can be disabled and be classist; mix and match any of the above and it still rings true. Smollett attempting to exploit himself only reflects poorly on him. If convicted, he’ll get the notoriety he desired — not for his work, but for being a terrible person.

I can't believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar!"" Rayka Zehtabchi during the acceptance speech for Best Documentary Short Subject for ""Period. End Of Sentence.""

Another Oscars go down in history as...well, the word that springs to mind is ""uneventful"". You know you're in trouble when it took a quip about the female menstrual cycle to grab the attention of this very sexually active gay man. Speaking of being grabbed, I couldn't help but notice that none of the four winners for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" thanked the person responsible for those wins. So I'll say it—thank you, Bryan Singer.

An Oscar highlight was the performance by Queen. And even I learned something. Did you know that Adam Lambert was in ""Bohemian Rhapsody""? He's the guy who hooked up with Freddie Mercury in the truck stop restroom. Since he's now lead singer of the band, it's like he had sex with himself—probably not the first time.

It seems each year notable people are inevitably omitted from the ""In Memoriam"" segment, and this year was no different. Egregiously absent was Carol Channing, who was also an Oscar nominee! And, where was Kaye Ballard? Oh, the humanity! I can understand skipping Sondra Locke—they probably wanna stay on Clint's good side!

Let me give some advice to all singers out there. When the note is flat, you know what doesn't help cover it up? Holding it longer and screaming. And, for heaven's sake, learn the lyrics. It's pretty obvious who is hugging the TelePrompTer for words and who is actually connecting with the song and the audience.

In the month leading up to the Oscars, there was lots of talk about how the Academy could trim the festivities. One of the most controversial considerations was to give out certain awards during commercials. Another plan was to ditch performances of most nominated songs and allow only two—Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper warbling ""Shallow"" (from ""A Star Is Born"") and Kendrick Lamar singing ""All the Stars"" (from ""Black Panther""). Now, I think I've made it clear I am not a Lady Gaga devotee. Not that I have anything against her, I simply don't get all the hoopla. However, even I must give credit where credit is due. Gaga insisted that if ALL nominated songs were not included, she would not perform. So, we can thank Gaga for Bette Midler's performance of ""The Place Where Lost Things Go"" (which happened because Emily Blunt was skittish about performing live).

I know what you're thinking—why wasn't ""All the Stars"" performed during the Oscar telecast? We're told that decision came from Kendrick Lamar, himself. Apparently, he was touring for the past month and didn't feel he could get an Oscar-worthy performance together. So, he simply took a pass.

Timing was not on Gaga's side with her engagement to fiancé Christian Carino imploding days before the Academy Awards. However, they seem to still be on speaking terms. When they ran into each other at CAA's pre-Oscars soirée, they said a quick hello. FYI, her Oscar date was longtime manager, Bobby Campbell.

I suspect we'll be talking about Jussie Smollett for weeks/months to come. And the story keeps getting worse. Now that the details have taken over mainstream media, I almost don't feel the need to enumerate every twist and turn. Suffice it to say, he did it. There, I said it. I hate to say it, but that's that. Once the grand jury sent the case to trial, I knew there was obviously some sort of proof we didn't know about. And, of course, more has come out. Like what, you may ask? First, there's the text message to one of the brothers sent three days before the attack saying, ""Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?"" Perhaps more damning is the personal check for $3,500 which he wrote to the brothers. Doesn't he watch ""Dateline""? You never write a personal check! By the by, his text message history also showed that since the spring of 2018, Jussie was getting MDMA from the brothers—not that there's anything wrong with that. And, while not germane to this case, it does tickle me every time the media refers to the ""Subway restaurant""—like it's got a Michelin rating!

FOX, which had initially stood behind Jussie, is now declining all comment. While ""Empire"" had insisted they would not alter their planned trajectory for the show, they are now writing Smollett out of the last two episodes of the season. Once again, I reiterate that someone is innocent until proven guilty—even though I've already said that I believe he did it. And I will be shocked if the proof doesn't bear that out. What will happen next? I cannot imagine Jussie wants this to go to trial, so I suspect some sort of plea deal is being floated to the DA. If that doesn't work, he may simply plead guilty. How will he go on after that? More to the point, will he.

After Jussie's ""attack"", there was some speculation that it was a drug or sexual hookup gone wrong (and after seeing those pics of the brothers on BillyMasters.com, I can picture that). But there is a case in the news which is a gay hookup and a drug situation gone wrong. This is regarding KTLA's Chris Burrous. At the end of last year, the anchor was found unresponsive in a Glendale motel. Turns out, the married father had hooked up with a guy through Grindr (they'd played together before) and met at the motel. Allegedly, Burrous got there first, set up the room with what is called ""DJ-style lighting"", and had S&M toys—including a leather mask he was wearing. Otherwise, he was nude when his playmate arrived. Reportedly, the 43-year-old newsman had inserted a rock of crystal meth in his ass, gave his partner some GHB, and was using poppers. Later, he inserted a second rock you-know-where. Then...well, let's just say his paramour turned him into a human puppet. Unbeknownst to the partner, Burrows had at some point vomited in his mask, and you know what that means—no refund. Let this be a lesson for you...when you're gonna do a ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" impersonation, have 911 on speed dial!

Last week, I accompanied Jenifer Lewis to the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards. When asked how she felt, Jenifer said, ""Well, I'm honored. I'm honored to be honored."" Now, who else could pull that off? Her award was presented by original ""Dreamgirls"" Sheryl Lee Ralph and Loretta Devine, along with Jenifer's daughter Charmaine. The other honorees were Regina Hall, KiKi Layne, and Amandla Stenberg. Some of the people in attendance were my dear Sherri Shepherd, Angela Bassett, Iyanla Vanzant, CCH Pounder, Regina King, Spike Lee, Billy Porter, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and even Puff Daddy (who I was sitting next to). The event was hosted by Kelly Rowland, who remembered me from hosting LA Pride. How did this little white boy from Boston, Massachusetts end up in the middle of a gala event celebrating Black women? Dare to dream.

Despite the wattage of the room, Jenifer managed to weave her unique magic, steal the show, and touch upon a story we covered earlier. ""I was asked on the carpet so many times, 'What do you think, Miss Lewis?' I have no comment. Today is a day to celebrate. But this is what you will be hearing tomorrow."" She then sang her latest song. ""Before you lie to us, remember Rosa sat on that bus. Before you tell your tale, remember Mandela sat in that jail. Before you do anything, remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Before you connive and steal, I dare you to Google Emmett Till. Before another dawn, and I speak to everyone, remember whose shoulders you stand on.""

The next night, I was with another white boy with more than a bit of black in him. The incomparable Sam Harris (assisted by the phenomenally talented pianist Todd Schroeder) was featured in concert at the Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood, and my God, he just gets better and better. He's so good, he almost pisses me off! So many highlights, but I think having him recreate the opening number from ""The Life"" knocked me out the most. It took me back to seeing the show on Broadway—a show that had a first act that lasted almost two hours! But, here's the thing—any amount of time you can spend with Sam is never enough. Thanks to Chris Isaacson for continuing to produce such great events in Hollywood. Upcoming concerts include Brian Justin Crum on March 7th, Joey Arias & Sherry Vine on April 7th, Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal on April 15th and 17th, and the fabulous Erich Bergen on April 24th and 25th.

Last week, we lost acclaimed fashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld. He was 85. There was much speculation about where his vast fortune would end up. Turns out, his primary beneficiary is Choupette, his beloved cat. The bequest is not without complications. According to French law, pets cannot inherit cash. ""Well, it's lucky I'm not French then,"" Lagerfeld told an interviewer this past year. Touché!

When I'm being catty, it's definitely time to end yet another column. Didya notice there were lots of trains and capes during this awards season? And that's just on Billy Porter! You can keep track of this Billy by heading over to www.BillyMasters.com—the site that is honored to be honored. If you have any questions, you can drop a note to Billy@BillyMasters.com and I promise to get back to you before Adam Lambert has another bathroom hookup. Until next time, remember, one man's filth is another man's bible.

Before Smollett's tale of being of a victim of an attack by two men yelling pro-Trump slogans fell apart, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of many who vouched for his character, blamed President Donald Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such an attack. Waters said: ""I know Jussie. I love him. His family's a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what's happening, what's going on.""

This ""man of impeccable character and integrity"" appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" two weeks ago, where an oh-so-sympathetic Robin Roberts interviewed him. Smollett, at times tearing up, described the pain of being attacked by racist Trump-supporting homophobes. But he also described his second painful experience, that of being doubted. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black,"" Smollett told Roberts, ""I feel like the doubters would've supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett's alleged hoax raised many interesting questions, one of which is this: How often do people lie to or about the police?

In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, with a population of approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, a follow-up analysis showed use-of-force incidents on the shifts with body cams were down 59 percent compared to those without cameras. But something else rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers -- with or without body cams -- were down 87.5 percent from the prior year.

Why? It was not because officers changed their behavior. They applied the same training they used before body cams. It was the civilians who changed their behavior. It turned out that when civilians knew they were being recorded, they behaved better and stopped making false accusations. Civilians -- aware that they might be taped -- became less confrontational, followed officers' instructions more readily and did not engage in the kind of resistant behavior as before random cops were required to use body cams. As a result, officers did not have to use the kind of force previously needed.

A 20-year veteran Rialto police officer told me: ""Newspapers make you think that the cameras made us change what we did and how we went about our business 'because the cops were being watched.' That's not true. The cameras made the civilians stop lying about us, reduced the mouthing off and the kind of resistance we used to see.""

The city of Rialto is not alone in experiencing an almost 90 percent drop in officer complaints as a result of body cams.

A 2016 Cambridge University study of five police stations in the U.K. (in England and Northern Ireland) and two in the U.S. (including Rialto) found the same result. Complaints against the police fell 93 percent when some officers were randomly assigned body cams. Jayne Sykes of the West Yorkshire Police Department said: ""Anecdotally, in terms of bringing offenders to justice, our Crown Prosecution Service have said to us on numerous occasions that the video footage has tipped the ballot in favor of prosecution, whereas without it, they may not have been able to prosecute. And also, again anecdotally, we're getting more early guilty plea from suspects which saves the victim the trauma of having to go to court and give evidence.""

Barack Ariel from Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, one of the authors of Cambridge's study, says that in the original Rialto study, the drop in complaints against police translated into a savings of $4 in complaint litigation for every $1 spent on the installation of body cams.

In the last two years, there have been several hate crimes later exposed as hoaxes. Nikki Joly, a Michigan LGBT activist lost his house in a 2017 fire, which killed his two dogs and three cats inside the home. Two days later, the activist exhorted his followers ""to be angry, be very angry."" The police quickly determined it was arson, while the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. As a result of his ""plight,"" the activist, called ""citizen of the year"" by a local newspaper, received $58,000 in donations. But a year later, the police charged the activist with setting the fire.

When Smollett's hate crime claim imploded, Roberts called Smollett's story ""a setback for race relations."" About the assertion made by many blacks that cops engage in ""systemic"" or ""structural"" or ""institutional"" racism, one must ask this question: What impact do false accusations against cops play in pushing the ""cops are out to get us"" narrative?

""You ought to look it up. Spend an afternoon reading the stories before they get scrubbed off the internet. It's an education. You will never believe CNN again. Trust me."": Well, when Jussie Smollett's hoax was still being investigated by the police, ""The New York Times"" and other media outlets suggested that it was a quote, ""conspiracy theory"" to suspect that his claims might not be true. The message was, ""Shut up and believe it or else you're a bad person if not clinically insane.""Now, as is so often the case, the few people who were willing to think for themselves turned out to be absolutely right. The press is scrambling to explain how exactly did that happen? How could reporters who are literally paid to be skeptical have fallen for such an obvious lie? It's not an easy question to answer. It's far easier just to pretend the whole thing never happened and that's what some are doing.Jeff Bezos' ""Washington Post"" for example, carries the almost amusingly pompous slogan, ""Democracy dies in darkness."" It's right on the masthead. And yet, just yesterday, ""The Post"" did its best to add to that darkness. The newspaper refused to run a single news story about Jussie Smollett's hoax. If you got your news from ""The Washington Post,"" you would still believe that Smollett was attacked by white racists for the crime of opposing Donald Trump.MSNBC did pretty much the same thing. Once Smollett was arrested, the channel did not even cover the story in prime time. Other journalists have decided that Smollett cannot be guilty, he simply can't be. Somebody must have set him up, probably from the racist Chicago Police Department. In other words, if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)I think we need to see some of the evidence. I think it's very concerning that all of these leaks came from the Chicago Police Department. So frankly, all we have is leaks from the Chicago Police Department, now what they said in this press conference and what Jussie Smollett and his team have said.This Police Department did in 2016, openly through their union, support Donald Trump. So to have a police department that hasn't been as cooperative as they have been in this round, do not openly give information, do openly lie and mishold information in cases and then to know that they are openly -- have openly supported Donald Trump of the 2016 election, a lot of activists on the ground are saying, ""Wait, what's going on here? Who do we believe out of these two suspect people?""(END VIDEO CLIP)So was it a racist conspiracy from the Chicago Police Department? That's a little far even for a lot of people on cable news. So those people can say that yes, perhaps Jussie Smollett's claims weren't entirely factually true, but so what? They could have been.Actual Trump supporters may not have assaulted him on the street in Chicago, but they would have it if they could have.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)If it is true, didn't he in fact attempt to paint MAGA supporters as these racist and homophobic people?But Mischelle, I have to respectfully disagree, I think MAGA supporters have painted themselves as that. I mean, when you look at footage, when you hear things they say, this is the honest to goodness truth and we have to be bold enough to call that out.(END VIDEO CLIP)So this is the new official story, the one you are going to be hearing for a long time, the one your kids will be learning about in school and it's this. A specific hate crime may not have happened in this case, but hate crimes overall are incredibly common and the incidence of them is rising, so the lesson of Jussie Smollett isn't to be more skeptical of hate crimes, but to be more credulous.CNN wants that to be your take away from the whole thing. It doesn't matter that its anchor slandered and defamed almost half the country over a lie. There is a much more important point here, listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)This is an America where hate groups, hate crimes are on the rise.The reality is, there has been a rise in hate crimes. There has been a rise in intolerance.CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: We know that hate crimes are on the rise, a lot of people don't want to accept that, they want this to be trumped up.(END VIDEO CLIP)So the problem with what you just heard is, it's a crock, it's totally false. In fact, it's provably untrue. Anyone who says otherwise like the people you just heard is either intentionally misleading you or doesn't understand the numbers and that would include most journalists.Type in the phrase ""hate crimes"" into Google and you will see story after story claiming that thousands of these atrocities take place every year in our country and the incidence of them is rising.A story in Vice News yesterday for example claimed that in 2017, there were 7,175 hate crimes in America. Now, reporters almost never do their own statistical analysis for stories like this. They tend to be bad at math. In fact, that's why they are journalists in the first place and not in private equity making real money.So instead, reporters take their numbers wholesale from partisan activists who pose as researches or from holy fraudulent organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups use moral panics to gin up fund- raising. They get rich doing it, so of course, they continue. The problem is there aren't that many hate crimes occurring in the country, it's just not a very hateful place so they have to make them up. How do they do that? They do it, and this is key, by counting accusations as crimes.An accusation is not the same thing as a crime, it's not even close. So if I accuse you of committing armed robbery that does not need that robbery occurred. You have to be convicted of it and once you are, I can count what you did as a crime. Otherwise, it's just something that you said, it doesn't mean anything.In real life, hate crimes are rare, consider the numbers from California, it's by far our biggest state. Nearly 40 million people live in California. Its demographics have changed dramatically in recent years. So if hate crimes were an epidemic, you would expect to see an awful lot of hate crimes in California, but you don't.In 2017, in the state of California, they convicted a total of 65 people for committing hate crimes, that's out of 39.5 million people. In other words, far more people got face tattoos or died while taking a shower than committed hate crimes, 65 hate crimes. And by the way, that number has fallen, not risen. In 1996, California recorded 87 hate crimes. So that's the growing epidemic that Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo were just telling you about. They are lying. It's a fraud.Hate hoaxes by contrast are common. The media spends a lot of time denying that which is your first tip that it's real. Just this morning, ""The New York Times"" wrote a headline that began ""Hate Crime Hoaxes Are Rare.""""Rolling Stone"" whose most famous story ever was a hoax, assures us that quote, ""False reports of hate crimes are exceedingly rare."" All the rest of the newsroom lemmings nod their heads in agreement, ""Um, yes, don't believe your eyes, this stuff never happens."" But it does happen, in fact, it happens regularly.Indeed, the higher the profile of the hate crime, the more likely it is to be fake. Those racist messages at the Air Force Academy, you might have read about. The General who runs the place gave an anguished response speech that seemed sincere and it went viral. But the whole thing was fiction. The fake victims did it to themselves.How about those three University of Albany students who were attacked by white supremacist on the bus a few years ago. Hillary Clinton immediately weighed in, of course, she was deeply outraged, ""This is America,"" she said. It turns out the three students were the dangerous ones themselves. They had attacked a woman and then invented a hoax to cover their tracks.Threats to Jewish Community Centers were a huge story in 2017. The press suggested they were the work of some deranged anti-Semitic Trump supporters, assuming that's not redundant in the view of the press.Once again, totally fake. An Israeli teenager did it. And so on and on and on. In the space of a single month, November 2016, there were at least 13 well-publicized hate crimes that turned out to be hoaxes - thirteen. That was also the month that Trump got elected, which tells you what's really going on here. Hate hoaxes are politically useful and that's why people continue to stage them.We can go on about this and give you many more examples starting with the Covington story just last month. There are lots and lots of examples. Hate hoaxes are so common that you could write a whole book about them and people have, it's all public. You ought to look it up. Spend an afternoon reading the stories before they get scrubbed off the internet. It's an education. You will never believe CNN again. Trust me."

Dennis Graham, father of the rapper Drake, has spoken out in support of both R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett — who are supposedly “good friends” of his.

Graham, a musician himself, was asked to give his thoughts on the pair’s legal troubles during an interview with Variety this week, which focused on an upcoming song that he plans to release called “That On That.”

When questioned about Kelly and the sexual abuse charges that the singer is facing — involving four victims, three of whom were allegedly minors — Graham said: “He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100 percent.”

Asked about Smollett, who is facing disorderly conduct charges for allegedly filing a false police report about a hate crime that he claims to have suffered in Chicago, Graham said: “Jussie has been misunderstood…they know that.”

Graham added, “That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.”

Smollett and Kelly are both free on bond. They have each denied the allegations against them and entered not guilty pleas."

In a guest column featured in The Hollywood Reporter, Page said that the dispute over whether Smollett staged his own attack shouldn’t distract people from the “very real” violence that the LGBTQ community faces.

“While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” her column read.

CLAY AIKEN: JUSSIE SMOLLETT SHOULD BE ‘MADE AN EXAMPLE OF’ IF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM ARE PROVEN TRUE

“The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath,"" she told the outlet. ""I had no reason to doubt Jussie.”

Weeks earlier, Page, who identifies as gay, used her appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” to criticize Pence in the wake of Smollett's claims.

“Vice President Mike Pence who, like, wishes I couldn’t be married. Let’s just be clear,” she said. “The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love I have with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana. He believes in conversion therapy. He has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.”

She also said at the time: “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them – you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed that he was attacked by two men wearing Make America Great Again hats in Chicago in late January. He said the suspects hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him during the attack.

As the investigation unfolded, Chicago police said that new information led them to believe that Smollett staged the attack to further his career.

CHICAGO POLICE SAY THEY HAVE MORE EVIDENCE JUSSIE SMOLLETT STAGED HATE CRIME

Page, currently co-starring in the Netflix series ""Umbrella Academy,"" went on to say in her piece that if the allegations are true that Smollett staged the attack, it could serve to harm the LGBTQ community further.

“If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.”

Now we know why kids are bullies. According to Lorraine Lombardo, everyone picking on Trump are teaching kids to be bullies.

Apparently, Lombardo was on a different planet when the “bully-in-chief” mocked a journalist with disabilities, or she never heard him call Sen. Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” repeatedly. Trump can’t call anyone who disagrees with him by their name unless he adds a snide remark to it.I can only think that anyone who supports this person has no morals and condones lying and bullying.

By the way, how are the tax refunds working out for his base? I bet they didn’t get the tax break he did.

Liberals discriminate against conservatives

The reprehensible actions of Jussie Smollett, recently in Chicago, will hopefully come at great cost to him, both personally and professionally.

His fabrications are emblematic of the present day level of discrimination shown by liberals toward conservatives. His resulting lies are on the verge of qualifying as hate speech.

It seems as though he and others like him, have reached a point when fulfilling their narrative is paramount and the truth be damned: If we say it and can’t prove it, then we must manufacture falsehoods and represent them as facts, in order to advance our cause.

Make America Great Again is an ideal that many Americans now subscribe to. No matter how many lies Jussie and others like him tell, they will not deter people of conservative leanings. It is hoped Smollett will learn from whatever awaits, as he deservedly resides in the Cook County jail system.

It’s legal to sell marijuana

Re “San Bernardino police arrest ‘California’s cannabis landlord’ during raid at her home” (Feb. 22):

You have got to be kidding, right? The state of California legalized the selling of marijuana. California is a very liberal state. It has been declared a sanctuary state. Are all of these statements true?

Cannabis is a product produced on the marijuana plant. Cannabis is used by many for its health benefit. True?

Why then was one female arrested, booked and held in custody in lieu of $30,000 bail for selling a controlled substance? If all of the above statements are true, then this is a display of hypocrisy, is it not?

Kelly and Jussie Smollett",['Shirley Ju'],https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dennis-graham.jpg,"['future', 'support', 'r', 'drake', 'going', 'tone', 'thoughts', 'smollett', 'came', 'used', 'music', 'son', 'send', 'song', 'kelly', 'jussie', 'drakes', 'dad', 'talks']","If there’s any doubt about how big Drake has become, look no further than his father, Dennis Graham, who is releasing a song of his own this week. While Graham calls his music career a “hobby,” it has brought him some legit recognition. Last year, he made an appearance in a whiskey commercial for Virginia Black — alongside his son — and pretty much everywhere he goes, the elder Graham is recognized.

Graham talked to Variety about his new single “That On That,” as well as his thoughts on R. Kelly, whom he calls a “friend,” and Jussie Smollett, who he describes as “misunderstood.”

Congrats on your new single. Can you talk about the making of “That On That?”

I made it about 10 years ago. My brother and my cousin Tone Bling, we were just in my apartment. Tone came up with the track and I wrote the words to it.

Why did you decide to put it out now?

It was right. It sounded right. I went back and listened to some of the stuff I had in the archives. I ran across it and said, “Woah, that sounds good, let’s drop it!” But we had to do a remake on it because my [vocals] weren’t clear. Tone didn’t have a verse on there at first, I put him on it this time. I wanted a rapper Tone has been rapping all his life. He’s a first cousin.

It seems like hip-hop today is much more melodic. Is that what you were going for?

Yeah, I was just looking for today’s sound. It came out perfect.

Can you talk about the lyrics?

The lyrics are not specific to anyone, it’s just something that I made up one night. Actually at the time I did have a girlfriend that was sort of like that. She was always checking my phone. If I was in the other room working on some music, she would be peeping through the door.

I was going to say, because the lyrics feel kind of stalker-y.

Yeah, she was like that. Always calling me on my phone every time I go out. Constantly leaving messages, won’t leave me alone. [Laughs.]

How long did that last?

That lasted for maybe a couple years. … She was one of the most beautiful people that you’re ever going to meet, but that song wasn’t just about her. It’s about women in general, we can all relate to it.

Has Drake shared his thoughts on the song?

Drake was the first one to tell me, “Dad, I love that song.” He sent me a text message actually. [Shows text that reads “So fucking good.”] Drake heard it when I first did it 10 years ago. He had heard it before because everything that he did, he used to send to me first. And whatever I did, I used to send to him. But now he’s too busy for that, he doesn’t send me anything now.

Have you guys made music together?

No, not yet.

Why not?

I don’t know, we just never got around to it, yet. I’ll say yet, but we are definitely going to do something.

Who are your greatest musical influences?

I feed off of everyone. I don’t have a certain person I would say influenced me because the era that I grew up in Johnnie Taylor, Otis Redding, B.B. King, Bobby “Blue” Bland, all those people influenced me. All the soul music and blues, that stuck with me more than anything because that was my era.

Do you share any of those influences with Aubrey?

Yeah, he knows everything I know. He knows all the music that I came up with, he had to listen to. We used to take 18 hour drives down to Memphis every summer, we would take turns listening to his music and my music. He turned me on to rap music and I turned him on to my music. We switched off in the car.

“So Far Gone” celebrates its tenth anniversary this month. What was Drake like when that mixtape came out in 2009?

Oh boy, he was just getting started. I went on his first tour with him. I have pictures of being on the tour bus with him. It was so exciting. With him signing to Young Money, and knowing he was on his way, and Wayne had his back, that was the most beautiful thing. I’m just about to leave now to go with him on his European tour.

Any thoughts on R. Kelly, who’s been arrested for sexual abuse against minors?

He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.

What about Jussie Smollett, who’s been accused of faking a hate crime against himself?

Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.

Did you see Tiffany Haddish on ABC talking about dancing with you and Drake at last year’s Vanity Fair post-Oscar party?

Of course I did. Tiffany is amazing and crazy. She’s a funny person. I saw her in New York not too long ago. We kicked it in a minute and that was it. We were talking about music, she said she was going to start doing music and I said we should do something together.

Talk about your music career. Any goals for yourself?

No, I’m doing things as I feel. I’m not trying to start a career. If I feel it, I will put it out, but it’s strictly a hobby.

What are you most excited for in 2019?

Living. [Laughs] Being alive baby.

So on Tuesday, Tucker Carlson brought it up on his show with Massachusetts radio host Howie Carr, who asserted that, needless to say, the media coverage has been inadequate because it “doesn’t fit the narrative.”

The encounter, which was caught on video, took place at a Mexican restaurant in Falmouth, Massachusetts and the alleged perpetrator, Rosiane Santos, has been in the country illegally since “she overstayed a tourist visa back in 1994,” according to Carlson. An ICE spokesman described Santos as “an unlawfully present citizen of Brazil.”

Carlson described the attack as “the perfect story” but Carr disagreed: “It doesn’t fit the narrative. It’s an American citizen being attacked by a woman who turns out to be an illegal alien by her own admission.”

Carr said he texted the victim, Brayton Turner and joked: “So I guess you’ll be on with Robin Roberts tomorrow on GMA and then you’ll go on with Brooke Baldwin and she can say ‘this is America in 2019.’” The quip about Baldwin referred to a statement she made on January 29's CNN Newsroom when the story about a supposed racially motivated attack by Trump supporters on actor Jussie Smollett first broke.

The longtime talk radio show host had previously described the encounter in Falmouth as a “real hate crime.” At the very least, it was a politically motivated crime directed at the victim specifically because of his political beliefs.

As NewsBusters has previously reported, the media only appear to care about certain types of hate crimes; which almost exclusively depend on the identity of the victim. A NewsBusters study found that the broadcast networks spent 157 minutes on the Smollett story during the first three weeks after the story broke while spending 24 minutes on an actual hate crime directed at an autistic white man in early 2017 and also took place in Chicago.

Later, Carlson concluded that “if they got rid of the few independent voices in media and we’re one and you are one, it would just be a chorus singing the same tune and that’s what they want.” If the “chorus” had its way, no one in America would have any idea about what happened to Bryton Turner.

Williams', 'Syndicated Columnist']",,"['good', 'bad', 'black', 'hoax', 'racial', 'supporters', 'trump', 'crime', 'students', 'college', 'hate', 'hoaxes']","Jussie Smollett, Empire actor, claimed that on Jan. 29, two masked men identifying themselves as Donald Trump supporters and using racial and homophobic insults attacked him. Smollett said the assailants yelled “This is MAGA country,” bashed his face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach and put a noose around his neck. Smollett's telling of the hate crime was gobbled up hook, line and sinker by the anti-Trump news media, but Chicago police say it was a hoax. This type of hoax is part and parcel of the left's broad agenda of victimology, fraudulence and gimmickry, plus gross media gullibility, incompetence and political attention seeking. What's so troublesome is the fact that despite considerable evidence that the incident was a hoax, no apologies have been issued to either the public or the targets of their malfeasance — President Trump and the Americans who voted for him.

Racial hoaxes have been a major part of the leftist agenda going back decades. In 1987, the Rev. Al Sharpton created the Tawana Brawley hoax, wherein four white men were falsely accused of rape. For perpetrating the hoax, Sharpton was rewarded by receiving national recognition, millions of dollars and a career as a television/radio talk show host, and he ran for president in 2004. He also received 82 invitations to advise Barack Obama's White House on matters of race.

Most of the nation's racial hoaxes take place on college campuses. Recall the 2006 Duke lacrosse rape case, in which three affluent white male Duke students were falsely accused of raping a black female stripper. Police exposed Bowling Green State University student Eleesha Long as a liar after she complained about being attacked by Trump supporters the day after his election. At Goucher College in Maryland, scrawlings depicted swastikas and also spelled out the N-word and the names of four black students -- including the perpetrator. The Maryland police found out that the perp was a 21-year-old black lacrosse player seeking victimhood. Nonetheless, the incident led to protests, demands for designated safe spaces and demands that incoming freshmen and transfers be required to take a “cultural competency” course.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has compiled some of the most outrageous hate crime hoaxes since Trump was elected. The hate crime hoaxes include claims of attacks on Muslim men and women by Trump supporters. A bisexual woman falsely claimed that Trump supporters were sending her nasty notes. Most of the hate crime hoaxes have been committed by black students. Their charges include the posting of KKK signs, the sending of racist notes and the writing of racist graffiti on a black person's door with the words “Go Home N----- Boy” and “Whites Only.” A black man was caught on camera spray-painting doors and vehicles with racial slurs, vulgar words and swastikas.

Even professors create hoaxes. Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain sent bogus anti-Muslim emails to himself, according to police, ""trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself."" He was arrested for filing a false police report.

Here's the good news about the racial hoaxes on the nation's college campuses: Left-wing college students have a difficult time finding the actual racism they claim permeates college campuses. Thus, they have to invent it. Though it has not been proved yet, these students may have support for their racial hoaxes by diversity-crazed administrators, who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda. Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets.

Black people, as well as homosexuals, should condemn these hoaxes, but so far, most have remained silent. If police are right that Smollett's claims were a dastardly hoax, it will cause doubt to be cast on future real claims of assault based on race and sexual orientation. It also will have a negative impact on race relations. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Smollett is found guilty of a felony as he is charged, he should suffer heavy penalties, including jail time. There's a lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fables, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”"

Despite the fact that the evidence has only continued to build against Smollett, both worked to muddy the waters in Smollett’s favor instead of entertaining the notion that their preconceived biases about the case could be wrong.

Page did her part with an op-ed in a new issue of The Hollywood Reporter alongside a cover story that wondered if “career pressure and ‘addictive fame may have driven the Empire star to do ‘something desperate.’” No word on whether the entertainment outlet believes people should still be held accountable for their misdeeds that go astray of the law or if it should be thought out as someone else’s fault.

Page’s column (entitled “Hate Violence Is Not a Hoax”) insisted in the subhead: “While the media debates the ‘Empire’ star's case, it’s critical that we not lose sight of the real threats underrepresented communities face every day, writes the actress and activist.”

She relayed a December 30, 2018 incident in which a married lesbian couple were assaulted at a Seattle Seahawks game along with homophobic slurs, allowing her to assert: “We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence, like the violence these women experienced in Seattle, happen. They happen to us all the time.”

With the following mention of Smollett being the only nod in the entire piece, Page illustrated how she has no intention of apologizing for her comments on January 31’s The Late Show that blamed Christianity and Vice President Mike Pence for the alleged beating of Smollett (click “expand”):

It's the fear that makes us pause before grabbing the hand of our loved one in public. It's the fear that makes us consider whether or not we are in physical danger before we lean in for a kiss on the cheek. The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie. My work on Gaycation — the docuseries I produced to chronicle LGBTQ+ stories from around the world — introduced me to many survivors of hate violence. I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be. If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes. While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day. I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.

“My work and advocacy have taken me around the world, and I've had the opportunity to meet LGBTQ+ people who bravely face inequity and violence in their communities on a regular basis....As a queer but white cisgender woman, I benefit from the protections and safety that my income and status afford me. But I do not and have not escaped the threats of violence and the very real acts of violence and harassment,” she added.

Instead of elaborating on the damage Smollett has caused to actual victims of hate crimes, Page pushed ahead (click “expand”):

FBI data released in 2018 shows reported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent the year prior, the third consecutive year of escalation. In fact, the most recent study from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ+ community. The statistics are plentiful and powerful and all point to a rising tide of hate violence. When the rhetoric we read and the hate speech we hear comes from our politicians, our media and entertainment, our neighbors and families and our religious leaders, we internalize the pain in damaging, self-defeating ways. We are wary and afraid to report hate violence. We lose hope as we continue to be victimized. The cruelty, the hate and the words manifest shame. (....) No child, no teenager, no adult — no one deserves to be victimized because of who they are. No one should feel shame for who they were born to be or to live their life in fear. I am going to use my voice and visibility to continue speaking and — as storytellers and members of an industry with a global platform — I implore you to join me.

Switching over to Perry, he appeared on NBC’s Today and was asked by co-host Hoda Kotb to comment on Smollett because “[y]ou kinda weighed in early on Twitter” and that the account of what took place “started off one way and then the way police say — they’re describing it now as a hoax.”

Perry admitted that he wished a case involving two men named Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos had received more coverage, but then pivoted to defending Smollett because “he's adamant that he's telling the truth” and thus “he's not the type of person that would ever do that, so it's pretty — it’s pretty confusing.”

He added that “it’s a wait and see,” but Perry had already defended Smollett before that comment. Making matters worse, he then doubled down: “Listen, he is so adamant about it and he’s so convincing in his story that I'm just — I’m just hoping and standing with him, hoping that it all turns out in his favor for sure.”

So much for letting law enforcement do their jobs.

February 27, 2019

By Cherie Zaslawsky Kudos to the Chicago police force. Call it poetic justice, or karma, or old-fashioned honest-to-goodness justice – Jussie got it between the eyes.Although the mainstream media immediately decried this latest example of racism in America, every detail of this supposed ""hate crime"" attack against Jussie Smollett rang false from the start. This is a crime Hercule Poirot would have solved without leaving his flat – a case fishier than a bucket of red herrings.Someone should have told Smollett that Trump supporters aren't stupid. They don't wander around the streets of Chicago in polar vortex sub-zero weather in January at 2am. Nor do they look for black people to attack. On the contrary, they welcome the many black Americans who support the President, and hope for more to join their ranks. But Smollett definitively revealed his fraud when he claimed the perpetrators taunted him by exclaiming ""This is MAGA country."" Of course any Trump supporter, as well as any American with a functioning brain, knows that leftwing Chicago is most assuredly not ""MAGA country.""Meanwhile, back at the ranch, we have those paragons of Leftist identity politics Senators Booker and Harris sponsoring an anti-lynching bill.Whoa! Did I miss something?Have the Dems resuscitated their old organization, the KKK? Has there been a spate of lynchings in your town lately? Or is this simply virtue-signaling to rile up African Americans to vote for Booker or Harris – maybe one day even on the same ticket.Not willing to be daunted by mere facts, these two senators assure us lynching is alive and well in America and needs to be stamped out. According to Cory Booker, ""lynching is not a relic of a painful past,"" pointing to the recent attack against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. Ah yes – one of the hate crime props was a ""thin, light rope"" draped around Jussie's neck – hardly a lynching, but we get the point.Hmmm... Fortuitous timing for their Senate bill – almost as if Smollett's ""lynching"" attack were staged. Oh yes – it was.Many of us had never heard of Smollett before his despicable stunt, so let's take a closer look at him. Jussie Smollett may be a third-rate supporting actor, but he has a striking political background. His mother is close friends with none other than black radical Communist Angela Davis. Jussie's been photographed with the Obamas, and he knows Kamala Harris – small world.Perhaps to camouflage any suggestion of a political motive, Jussie, who apparently enjoys lying to police, claims he did it because he's unhappy with his salary. Huh? A million a year not enough for you, Jussie? But surely even he knows that making yourself the target of a phony hate crime is not the pathway to getting a raise. It's obvious that his fraud was a political hit job against President Trump and his supporters, meant to inflame African Americans and social justice warriors in order to garner votes for the Dems. And then there's that coincidental Anti-Lynching bill with its Orwellian redefinition of lynching....It's worth recapping Smollett's hoax, which Michelle Malkin dubs ""Fake Noose:""For the phony attack on himself, Jussie hires two Nigerian pals of his to play the part of white supremacists – probably because he wants to support black actors – and then pays them by check. You gotta wonder what he wrote on the memo line. He tells them to wear ski masks and MAGA hats and to bring rope for a noose to put around his neck. They couldn't find MAGA hats in downtown Chicago, but figured red caps would do in a pinch. The faux ""hate crime"" takes place in the wee hours and after the Nigerians skedaddle, Jussie calls the police who come ten minutes later; while waiting, he keeps the ""noose"" around his neck to be sure they see it. The MSM goes gleefully wild with the story – competitive virtue-signaling and MAGA bashing galore.Later, two white guys are fingered as the culprits by Smollett, arrested, charged, and found guilty, their lives ruined – or found not guilty, followed by a week or two of African American rioting in Chicago. Oops... Score that part as a ""could have been"" which was prevented, thanks to Chicago police detectives.But let's not forget Cory Booker's words of wisdom: ""We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise...the majority of them white supremacist attacks."" And check out this tweet from Kamala Harris: ""Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" Hmmm.... Doesn't speak too well of her social network.Senator Harris goes on to say, ""This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.""Well, I agree that we should confront the hate, but it's the Left's hate of the American people that we need to confront. And let's not dismiss Jussie's crime as a hoax as if that means it's not to be taken seriously. This despicable travesty has something in common with false flags – specious crimes that put the blame on an innocent party, in order to serve the political agenda of the real perpetrators.If Smollett doesn't do jail time for this shameful fraud against the American people, we'll only see more of these faux hate crimes. But there's a silver lining for those of us who love our country – the Dem's increasing desperation is waking up more and more Americans, ironically positioning Trump for a potential landslide win in 2020. The Left may have meant its strategy for evil, but perhaps God meant it for good.© Cherie Zaslawsky"

Police suggested they had an open-and-shut case against Smollett when they charged him last week with filing a false police report.

But there are several ways Smollett can try to convince a jury he’s been wrongly accused.

Smollett at first told police, on Jan. 29, that two men beat him, put a rope around his neck and covered him in bleach while shouting racist and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.”

Last week, police said Smollett, a star of Fox’s “Empire,” had actually hired brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, to attack him, and then reported it as a crime in order to get a salary increase.

Everyone agrees that Smollett had ties to the brothers, both of whom are weightlifters. Ola Osundairo appeared on “Empire.” ABC News said Smollett wrote Abel Osundairo a check for $3,500. Police say it was to pay for the attack, but the check says it was for training and a nutrition plan.

The pair were first arrested and questioned by police as persons of interest. But after 48 hours, police released them without filing charges, saying “new evidence” had emerged. Police filed charges against Smollett soon after.

Geragos raised questions on his “Reasonable Doubt” podcast about what happened while the brothers were in custody.

“Did you charge them? Did you give them immunity? Did you do anything with them?” he asked. “You said they changed their story in the 48th hour — why did they change their story? Was it lawyer-driven?”

A person with knowledge of internal discussions among Smollett’s defense team told TheWrap that they believe the brothers made a last-minute deal to avoid charges.

Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Geragos said police had a stronger case against the brothers than against Smollett. “I have not seen anything that supports this idea or the narrative that they put out there that he was in cahoots with anyone. They have a whale of a case against the two guys — the two brothers — but that’s it,” he said.

Los Angeles-based criminal defense attorney Lou Shapiro, who is not involved in the case, said Smollett’s team can argue that any deal casts doubt on the brothers’ credibility.

“Clearly some deal was struck, or some promise was made to them to tell the story and maybe it was a coerced confession in some way,” Shapiro said. “Maybe it wasn’t a deal, maybe they just felt so coerced and pressured that they had to tell the story just to get out, right? That’s another angle.”

Geragos also took issue with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson’s argument that Smollett staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.“

“Not only is that not true, they have video evidence that that’s not true,” he said. “They didn’t talk to his lawyer, they didn’t talk to anybody at the production company, they didn’t talk to an agent. Nobody. I’ve done that. I know for a fact that’s untrue. That’s categorically untrue. That’s not the motivation, yet that was what was articulated as the motivation.”

As TheWrap previously reported, Smollett was making around $125,000 per episode on “Empire” and there had been no salary dispute between the actor and the show. Several people told TheWrap that Smollett had never sought a raise.

“The theory that staging this would somehow help him get an increase in salary, that doesn’t follow logically, right?” Shapiro said. “Just because somebody is the victim of a hate crime doesn’t mean that their boss is gonna go, ‘OK, now we’re gonna give you that raise you asked for. Only because you’re a victim of a hate crime, now we’re going to give you that raise.'”

Geragos believes police assigned salary as a motive because it seems so “inexplicable” that Smollett would stage an attack on himself.

“They don’t need motive for a crime. It’s not an element of a crime,” he said. “But, it’s inexplicable if there’s no motive.”

Another potential play for the defense: Go after Johnson. A person privy to internal discussions among Smollett’s legal team said Johnson may have been playing to the cameras to protect his own job, which could be in danger if Toni Preckwinkle wins a runoff to become the next mayor of Chicago.

In December, the Chicago Sun Times wrote that “Police Supt. Eddie Johnson will be looking for a new job or living off his police pension” in the event of a Preckwinkle victory.

Preckwinkle told the paper that Johnson’s force has a “code of silence,” and cited what she believes were cover-ups in the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.

Shapiro said there could be several ways for Smollett to explain why he wrote Abel Osundairo the $3,500 check.

“He has to explain the check, he has to give what they call a plausible factual scenario for why he wrote that check,” he said.

ABC News posted a copy of a check Monday which is dated Jan. 23 — six days before Smollett reported the attack — and contains the memo line: “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).”

A person close to Smollett told ABC News the check was for $600 per week for a workout plan, plus $100 per week for nutritional help. The person said Abel Osundairo was helping Smollett get in better shape for a video for a song called “Don’t Go.”

ABC News also published text messages it said were between Smollett and one of the brothers, whom he called “Bon,” in which the two discussed exercise and meal regimens.

Meghan Blanco, another California-based criminal defense attorney not involved in the case, told TheWrap that Smollett’s team should seize on the shifting explanations for the check.

“It’s not unusual that he would write a check to personal trainers. So I would focus on that,” she said. “And the fact that that piece of information was provided to law enforcement early on — that it did not fit with law enforcement’s narrative of what they wanted to have happened — so they re-approached the brothers and got them to change their story to fit whatever the law enforcement’s narrative was. And when they came and told the news and the public about what had transpired, they had neglected to tell anyone that the brothers had initially told them that the check was for personal training. I think that’s a huge oversight on their part and I would argue that was intentional.”

Blanco said the shifting details surrounding the case wouldn’t hurt Smollett, because people who are traumatized often make errors under pressure.

“I expect that in the weeks and months to come, his attorneys are going to be able to piece together the information that was relayed to law enforcement in a way that makes sense and is consistent with their firm belief that the two men attacked him and that Jussie was the victim in this case,” she said."

Smollett alleged that two supporters of President Donald Trump assaulted him and poured a bleach-like substance on him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs last month. He was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report earlier this month.

The article is titled, “‘I’m About to Break’: Jussie Smollett and the Pressure of Hollywood Fame.”

“The ‘Empire’ actor claimed to be the victim of a heinous crime that played perfectly into Hollywood’s worst fears about hate in America,” the lede of the article reads. “Did the pressures of childhood fame or a struggling music career play a role in causing him to concoct what police are now deeming an elaborate hoax?” (RELATED: Here All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgment On The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

The article continues in part:

One question is whether the pressures and anxieties of modern fame played any role in Smollett’s seemingly inexplicable behavior. “One of the darkest corners of fame is that it becomes addictive,” says Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist who specializes in fame and celebrity, “and then you are so afraid of becoming a has-been or yesterday’s news that you might do something desperate.”

It goes on to explain Smollett’s childhood and how he got his start in acting and singing. The article also discusses Smollett’s seemingly deteriorating mental health.

If he’s convicted, Smollett faces a one- to three-year prison sentence and potentially fines of up to $25,000.

And since America is marinated in the juices of Hollywood, it’s a nice Rorschach test for the mysterious tendings of our nation.

By the way, I got in a late screening of Black Panther the night before. It’s about the techno-metropolis of Wakanda hidden deep in the African jungle lo these many centuries. (Who knew?) The elite of that utopia travel the world in flying saucers. When trouble turns up, what weapons do they reach for? Spears. I kid you not. My favorite line in the movie: American white G-man to Nakia, Black Panther’s ex-girlfriend: “Put that spear in the trunk!”

So… I tuned into the last ten minutes of the red carpet pre-game. Side boob as far as the eye could see — from women who will return to anti-rape culture activism when they get over their hangovers. Everybody on the runway was “stunning.” And they appreciated being informed of that, because they hear it so seldom. Glenn Close revealed that her gown contained four million beads and weighed 40 pounds. I hope she donates it to the Clinton Foundation for HRC’s 2020 nomination acceptance speech.

Oh, Black Panther just won its first award: costume design. It’s amazing what you can do with vibranium. It drapes beautifully, breathes, and can recharge your Tesla. I confess, the costumes kept me going through that movie because the story was so incomprehensible. LL Bean will be offering field jackets in Vibranium next fall, with a special pocket that charges your cellphone. I want one!

Cut to Marty Scorsese selling Rolex watches. Every American should have one, and when AOC is finally president, every American will have one!

Oh, Black Panther won another statuette-of-color for production design (sets and stuff). Fer sure, I felt that I was transported to another world where absolutely nothing was recognizable, which is also how I feel when I read The New York Times.

Followed by the strangest musical number of the night so far: Jennifer Hudson costumed like an elevator operator in front of a Supreme Court backdrop, belting out a power ballad about women and… well… power (from the documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg). Well, RBG is getting on in years. She certainly deserves an elevator in her place of business. More power to the ole gal!

Uh-oh, Black Panther just lost in the Sound Editing category. Unfair! Ballot recount, please!

Bunch of white guys won the Sound Mixing award for Bohemian Rhapsody. They all look the same. Same tuxedo. Same plain vanilla speech. Boring. I cannot tell you exactly how sound mixing differs from sound editing. Probably doesn’t. Fake award! Investigation perhaps?

Saved by another musical number: From Mary Poppins Reboot. Ole Bette Midler in an outfit that said Waitress-in-a-donut-shop. I think the song was composed in eleven minutes in the parking lot of the Shake Shack on Sunset off NW Knollwood.

Here comes Pharrell Williams in a camo tuxedo, soon to be worn by US Army Rangers in the forthcoming invasion of the Hamptons. Followed by some chick in a jogging outfit (best animated short). Followed by an hysterical babe “fighting for menstrual equality!” Empowerment, yes! Hear us roar! (Grrrowww!)

Commercials coming hot and heavy now, like the flak over Saarbrucken, 1942. A kind of battle fatigue settling over the auditorium. If it was me out there, I’d be hitting that half-pint of rock’n-rye in my back pocket.

More boring white guys picking up their awards for visual effects. Space movie. Does make you kinda wonder if we actually went up there in 1969, or was that a visual effect too? British accents. (Fake?) The odor of colonialism wafting out over the audience. Thank Gawd that’s over with.

Awards for short films nobody will ever see. (Yawn.)

Spike Lee wearing some kind of futuristic cab driver get-up: “Do the right thing.”

I confess, I don’t care who wins the bigly awards. (Double yawn.)

Most interesting feature of the whole excruciating spectacle: Nobody even mentioned the name of he-who-will-not-be-named-here-either (hint: occupies White House.) The word must have gone out… don’t…go…there. Was it the Jussie Smollett effect, or is something more sinister a’foot?

Anyway, I can’t take it anymore. Zzzzzzzzz….

(Joshua Lott/Reuters)

Jussie Smollett’s arrest deflated mainstream media for barely a millisecond.

Immediately upon charges being filed against Smollett for allegedly making a false police report, the progressive media narrative shifted to an alleged spike in hate crimes. This CNN headline is typical: “Hate Crimes Rising Regardless of Jussie Smollett.”

Almost every media outlet attributed the alleged increase in hate crimes to President Trump’s “divisive rhetoric.” The alleged increase, it was noted, had occurred “in Trump’s America,” “Amid Trump’s First Year,” and “Since Trump Took Office.” Even the 2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (of which I am a member) hate-crimes hearing was inspired by an alleged avalanche of hate crimes since Trump’s inauguration.

But the new narrative is inspired by either ignorance, mendacity, stupidity, or perhaps some combination thereof. A few facts:

Over the last decade the number of hate crimes has fluctuated between approximately 5,600 and 7,800 per year.

There were 7,615 total hate crimes reported in “Trump’s America” in 2017. Ten years earlier, when the U.S. population was 25 million less and far fewer agencies were reporting hate crimes, the number was nearly the same: 7,624. In 2006 (ten years before Trump’s America began) there were 9,652 hate crimes.

Hate crimes reported aren’t the same thing as hate crimes confirmed. Many hate crime reports are based on a victim’s perception of the reason for the crime. If a criminal uses a slur during a robbery he would’ve committed anyway, it may end up being reported as a hate crime.

There are more hate-crime statutes and ordinances today than there were just a few years ago and far more law-enforcement personnel have been trained to report hate crimes. Just a short time ago, if a white guy hit a black guy it would have been classified as aggravated assault, whereas today that same act is more likely to be classified as a hate crime.

There were over 1,000 more hate crimes reported in 2017 than in 2016. Journalist Robby Soave, who testified at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2018 Hate Crimes Hearing, notes that the 2017 increase likely is the result of 1,000 more agencies beginning to report hate crimes in 2017 than reported in 2016.

Nearly 90 percent of police departments reported zero hate crimes in 2017. As portrayed by mainstream media, hate crimes generally consist of violent thugs beating, say, an outnumbered Jussie Smollett. In reality, hate crimes are more likely to consist of graffiti and vandalism.

If Trump’s “divisive rhetoric” is spurring hate crimes, it’s doing so in counterintuitive fashion: blacks are approximately 200 percent more likely to commit hate crimes than whites.

Without diminishing hate (or any other) crimes, perspective is in order. Hate crimes are a vanishingly small portion of total crime. For example, a total of 1,231,566 murders, rapes, aggravated assaults, and robberies occurred in 2015. 821, or .00067, were classified as hate crimes. That’s for an entire year. An average of 550 Americans are struck by lightning per year, most of which strikes occur during just half the year. Even in Trump’s America.

Hayden Williams, a 26-year-old field organizer for the conservative Leadership Institute, was punched in the face on Feb. 19 by a man who appeared upset over a sign on his table about the harm of hate crime hoaxes, a reference to the Jussie Smollett case.

Dan Mogulof, the assistant vice chancellor in the Office of Communications and Public Affairs, said Tuesday the police department had concluded its investigation and was ""seeking a felony warrant from the Alameda County District Attorney for the identified suspect.""

However, the Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Teresa Drenick told the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday: ""The matter has not yet been formally submitted for consideration of charging and the investigation is ongoing.""

Asked for an update, Mogulof said, ""We have been in touch with the DA, and our police force is now doing some additional investigative work necessary for a determination of charges and/or the issuance of a warrant for the suspect's arrest.""

As Williams recruited for the right-wing group Turning Point on the campus's main plaza last week, two men approached his table and accused him of promoting racism and violence. As Williams and an onlooker both filmed, one man flipped over his table, began pushing him and swearing at him, and finally sucker-punched him in the face.

Williams, still sporting a black left eye from where he was punched, appeared on Fox News on Wednesday morning and could not comment on the details of the investigation. He noted there were people on campus who were hailing the man who punched him, and he criticized the school's administration for ""allowing it to get to this point"" where violence is accepted and even encouraged.

Berkeley stressed last week it in no way condones violence and condemned the assault. The identity of the suspect has not been released; as of last week, police did not think the suspect was a student.

Berkeley College Republicans President Matt Ronnau told the Free Beacon last week he was not surprised by the attack.

""I was pretty shocked that it had happened, but I wasn't, honestly, surprised, which is kind of disappointing, just given how Berkeley is and incidents that we've experienced in the past,"" he said. ""People here just don't get it. They just don't know how to act when someone expresses a viewpoint that they disagree with."""

The Jussie Smollett hoax has finally forced the mainstream media to acknowledge what Wilcox and others paying attention have known for decades: The left has been shamelessly spinning politically useful hoaxes since the October Revolution a century ago.

Wilcox's 1994 book,""Crying Wolf: Hate Crime Hoaxes in America,"" is still the standard in the field. Wilcox is no crank. His research collection is housed at the Spencer Library at the University of Kansas.

According to Wilcox, ""80 percent of the events that happen on campus are hoaxes or pranks."" He noted, ""It's a place where consciousness of discrimination, sexism and homophobia is at a peak, and when there's nothing happening, and they need something to happen, they can make it happen.""

With so many hoaxes in the news, it might be useful to expand on Wilcox's work and classify hoaxes as though they were hurricanes.

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

""Category 1"" hoaxes occur almost daily. The trail of destruction is usually limited to a given college campus. The emotional damage includes fainting, swooning and crying. The physical damage includes piles of discarded fliers and pools of melted candle wax.

Late in 2017, for instance, the normally sane Kansas State University suffered three Category 1 hoaxes in the space of a few months. In one case, a 21-year-old black man defaced his own car with racist graffiti. This inspired a weepy campus march before the hoax was exposed.

The marchers also lamented the destruction just a few days earlier of a Jewish Sukkah, a temporary hut constructed for use during a week-long Jewish festival.

A grad student who worked on ""diversity initiatives"" conveniently found the remains of the Sukkah and was quick to cry ""hate."" The police investigated and determined that the Sukkah was knocked down in a wind storm.

A few months before that a noose was found on campus among a scattering of ropes. After much fuss, the police put this issue quietly to rest as well.

""Due to the size, the material, and the placement, there's nothing to indicate [racism] was the intention,"" said a K-State detective whose common sense was as unwelcome on campus as head lice.

Category 2 hoaxes cause enough angst to get national attention. The Smollett hoax and the Covington Catholic hoax fall into this category. The exposure of the scam limits the damage.

Category 3 hoaxes have serious political consequences. They go largely undetected and their exposure as hoaxes is under-reported. The church burning hysteria of 1996 falls into this category.

Spun wildly by the hard-left National Council of Churches (NCC) and the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), the hoax hit America's newsrooms like a veritable Katrina.

In a three-month span, the NCC and CDR scam generated more than 2,000 articles, including three huge layouts on consecutive days in USA Today, a two-page spread in the New York Times and incendiary headlines like the following from the New York Daily News, ""Flames of Hate: Racism Blamed in Shock Wave of Church Burnings.""

This being an election year, President Clinton used a June radio address to warn America of the ""disturbing rash of crimes that hearkens back to a dark era in our nation's history.""

A month after Clinton's radio address, the Associated Press, having analyzed six years of federal, state and local data, quietly announced that there had been more fires at white churches in the South than black, that the totals for 1996 were within the normal range, that the numbers of fires had dropped off considerably since 1980, and that there was ""no evidence ... of a conspiracy or of a general climate of hatred.""

The suspects included blacks and whites, insurance scammers, devil worshipers, drunken teenagers and even bored fire fighters. As is their wont, the media buried the correction.

Category 4 hoaxes are rare. They must have significant political consequences and, to gain traction, they need a complete buy-in from the major media.

It is not enough that the media get things wrong. They must be knowingly and recklessly indifferent to the truth. The Russia hoax falls into this category. So too does the cover-up of the TWA Flight 800 shoot down in 1996.

Category 5 hoaxes have long-lasting, worldwide consequences that permeate the culture. Two come to mind. The lesser of the two is climate change (neé global warming), now in its fourth decade and still gaining strength.

The more destructive of two has been wreaking moral havoc worldwide for 160 years and shows only the slightest signs of abating.

So powerful are its supporters and so sacred its roots that I risk criticism from my own allies for daring to point out the obvious, namely that Darwinism, neo or old school, is nothing but wind."

Before Smollett's tale of being of a victim of an attack by two men yelling pro-Trump slogans fell apart, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of many who vouched for his character, blamed President Donald Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such an attack. Waters said: ""I know Jussie. I love him. His family's a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what's happening, what's going on.""

This ""man of impeccable character and integrity"" appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" two weeks ago, where an oh-so-sympathetic Robin Roberts interviewed him. Smollett, at times tearing up, described the pain of being attacked by racist Trump-supporting homophobes. But he also described his second painful experience, that of being doubted. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black,"" Smollett told Roberts, ""I feel like the doubters would've supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""

Smollett's alleged hoax raised many interesting questions, one of which is this: How often do people lie to or about the police?

In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, with a population of approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, a follow-up analysis showed use-of-force incidents on the shifts with body cams were down 59 percent compared to those without cameras. But something else rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers – with or without body cams – were down 87.5 percent from the prior year.

Why? It was not because officers changed their behavior. They applied the same training they used before body cams. It was the civilians who changed their behavior. It turned out that when civilians knew they were being recorded, they behaved better and stopped making false accusations. Civilians – aware that they might be taped – became less confrontational, followed officers' instructions more readily and did not engage in the kind of resistant behavior as before random cops were required to use body cams. As a result, officers did not have to use the kind of force previously needed.

A 20-year veteran Rialto police officer told me: ""Newspapers make you think that the cameras made us change what we did and how we went about our business 'because the cops were being watched.' That's not true. The cameras made the civilians stop lying about us, reduced the mouthing off and the kind of resistance we used to see.""

The city of Rialto is not alone in experiencing an almost 90 percent drop in officer complaints as a result of body cams.

A 2016 Cambridge University study of five police stations in the U.K. (in England and Northern Ireland) and two in the U.S. (including Rialto) found the same result. Complaints against the police fell 93 percent when some officers were randomly assigned body cams. Jayne Sykes of the West Yorkshire Police Department said: ""Anecdotally, in terms of bringing offenders to justice, our Crown Prosecution Service have said to us on numerous occasions that the video footage has tipped the ballot in favor of prosecution, whereas without it, they may not have been able to prosecute. And also, again anecdotally, we're getting more early guilty plea from suspects which saves the victim the trauma of having to go to court and give evidence.""

Barack Ariel from Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, one of the authors of Cambridge's study, says that in the original Rialto study, the drop in complaints against police translated into a savings of $4 in complaint litigation for every $1 spent on the installation of body cams.

In the last two years, there have been several hate crimes later exposed as hoaxes. Nikki Joly, a Michigan LGBT activist, lost his house in a 2017 fire, which killed his two dogs and three cats inside the home. Two days later, the activist exhorted his followers ""to be angry, be very angry."" The police quickly determined it was arson, while the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. As a result of his ""plight,"" the activist, called ""citizen of the year"" by a local newspaper, received $58,000 in donations. But a year later, the police charged the activist with setting the fire.

When Smollett's hate crime claim imploded, Roberts called Smollett's story ""a setback for race relations."" About the assertion made by many blacks that cops engage in ""systemic"" or ""structural"" or ""institutional"" racism, one must ask this question: What impact do false accusations against cops play in pushing the ""cops are out to get us"" narrative?"

In fact, Page openly wept on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show when they discussed the attack of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, and how horrible the hatred of that dreaded “other” has become ever since those dastardly Republicans took power. Like her televised tears, however, Smollett’s story seemed fake, and hardly anyone was surprised when it turned out to be the case.

Everyone was surprised except the Hollywood and the media, who once again bore an entire all-you-can-eat egg breakfast on their faces just as they were still trying to wipe off the Covington Catholic mess as well.

Undaunted, however, Page attempted to figuratively save some of her egg covered face by redirecting the attention back onto the people she swears up and down are the TRUE villains in this story, the religious right.

Writing an op-ed in The Hollywood Reporter, Page acknowledged that Smollett lied, but noted that Smollett’s story is still a reality. She begins by telling the story of a lesbian couple who was harassed, groped, and assaulted while attending a Seahawks game by a man. The man was tackled to the ground by other fans.

Police arrived and also struggled with the man, identified as Jay Dee Harp III, who fought them back as well, even going so far as to punch one of the officers in the stomach. Eventually, they were forced to taze him and found that he was heavily under the influence of alcohol. That information I got from the Seattle Times. Why Page didn’t include officers coming to blows with Harp, or that the man was drunk, I’m not sure. It doesn’t make what he did any better, but at least it offers some more context.

Page then proceeds to tell us that she’s met with people from the LGBT community all over the world, and has been told stories of hate crimes done upon them, then says she’s attempting to use her “privilege” and status as a platform to make the world aware of their pain.

In the midst of telling you all of this, she tells you not to question them or her about any of this:

I ask you not to question our pain, not to draw into question our trauma, but to maintain, wholeheartedly, that hate violence exists. The merits of one case should not and cannot call that into question. The media coverage does not convey the reality and totality of the cruelty and danger we face. This is the story that must be told.

Page then goes on to give us stats — that I won’t bore you with here — about suicide rates among the transgender community, and how hate crimes have been on the rise. All of this, she says, comes from “rhetoric we read and the hate speech we hear” from “our politicians, our media and entertainment, our neighbors and families and our religious leaders.”

She ends by stating that we need to “have to work together to end the normalization of anti LGBTQ+ sentiment and rhetoric.”

Some quick facts before we continue. Hate crimes are actually on a ten-year decline, and are, in fact, incredibly rare. In truth, many of the “hate crimes” reported involve things as simple as stealing an LGBT flag off a poll, or just someone saying something mean to them.

It should also be noted that the suicide rate among transgendered individuals is so high is due to the fact that transgenderism is a mental disorder. Many people have been far more oppressed and marginalized than the trans community, and none of these races or religions came close to the same suicide rate as the trans community does. Also, suicide rates skyrocket by 19 times when transition surgeries are performed.

One doctor reported that he had a tidal wave of trans individuals who had the surgery come to him to request they be restored back to their original bodies. This triggered one scientist to want to study the phenomenon, but was denied by Universities to study it because they feared the LGBT mob.

With that out of the way, I want to make it clear that I hope people like Jay Dee Harp III who actually do commit these crimes are prosecuted. Nobody should be attacked verbally or physically, no matter what group they belong to.

But in that, I make my point. Members of every group are verbally or physically attacked for some reason. White kids in MAGA hats get attacked, and there are a handful of recent stories about that, one of which made national headlines because the very media was so willing to attack the kids. In fact, if you want a solid way to see someone assaulted, don’t grab the hand of a same-sex person, put on a red MAGA hat and walk around in public. Don’t worry, they’ll find you eventually.

And don’t let it slip past you that it was MAGA hat wearing Trump supporters that were targeted in the fake Smollett story Page was too ready to get weepy over.

People are attacked for having white skin, black skin, and brown skin. They’re yelled at because they’re Christian, Islamic, gay, straight, man or woman. Everybody faces some kind of prejudice from somebody out there, but we should be thankful that these idiots are rarer than they are numerous. Even in the story Page presented, it was one man who was doing the assaulting. She doesn’t seem to give much credence that it was an entire group of people, both with badges and without, that physically took him down.

Page doesn’t seem to be concerned about anyone else, however. As far as I can tell from her behavior, she sees the LGBT community, she sees herself and partner as she weeps openly on television, and she sees an avenue by which to attack her political opposition.

By her telling the hate only seems to come from one direction. She seems more concerned about getting hits on people she disagrees with ideologically than the fact that hate crimes are a thing. If she did care, she’s not showing much concern over people who don’t fall within the social justice sphere of protection.

To be honest, Page’s blustering seems to be more about her than anything else. Her causes, her politics, her image, and her spotlight. Page acts more like a woman with an ax to grind than a concerned citizen. She has a well-crafted narrative that she even OPENLY asks you not to question.

If I could figuratively try to pry Page’s eyes open for a second, I’d like to try to show her that the person with the most hate in the room is Page. She’s the one demonstrating more prejudice than anyone, even going so far as to attack Chris Pratt for attending a church she claims is anti-LGBT when she’s actually quite wrong on that regard.

Page is the kind of person Page purportedly hates. Page is the one spreading hate and tossing around rhetoric that divides us. Page, and people like her, are the one pushing this toxicity.

If she truly believes what she wrote in her last paragraph about “no child, no teenager, no adult” deserving to be victimized, then she needs to stop creating enemies, and truly start trying to bridge gaps.

But I won’t hold my breath."
