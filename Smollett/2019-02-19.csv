On Friday, Jan. 18th, a letter was sent addressed to Jussie Smollett and Cinespace Studios. “MAGA” was sloppily written in the return address space.

Cwbchicago.com reports: Four days later and about eleven miles away, the letter found its way to Smollett.

Something about the envelope must have raised concerns. Smollett would later tell police that he and Empire’s executive producer donned gloves before they opened it and exposed themselves to a threat letter covered in white powder. Police logged the time as 2:30 p.m.

The powder was later determined to be crushed Tylenol, according to reports. But the letter addressed to Smollett depicted a curly-haired stick figure being hanged by another stick figure with a noose.

Using individual letters and words that appear to be clipped from magazines, the sender threatened Smollett with an anti-black and anti-gay message:

“You will die black fag.”

About a week after Smollett opened the letter, he told police that he had been beaten and kicked in Streeterville by two men who recognized him from Empire. They poured bleach on him and—in throwbacks to the threat letter—called him anti-gay, anti-black slurs while putting a noose around his neck and screaming “this is MAGA country,” he said.

As Smollett reported the attack to police, a multi-agency federal investigation into the source of the threat letter was entering its seventh day.

Headed by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office, the terroristic threat investigation is being assisted by one of America’s oldest and most underestimated law enforcement agencies: The United States Postal Inspection Service.

Whoever sent the letter to Smollett may have considered the mail to be an untraceable way to deliver a message. They’d be mistaken.

“Those postal guys are the real deal,” said a North Side cop who worked with inspectors on a serial package theft case in Lincoln Park last November. “They can do amazing things and aren’t afraid of the work.”

Since being created by Benjamin Franklin—yes, that Benjamin Franklin—the service has learned a few things about tracing mail-based crimes. Figuring out who mailed a letter has been made easier because, while most criminals know to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, most criminals also forget to leave their cellphones at home when they go to the mailbox.

Even without tracking phones, inspectors have a catalogue of techniques developed over the course of 200 years to track a letter to its source. More than 1,000 “white powder” cases were investigated between January 2007 and March 2009 alone, according the LA Times.

And inspectors aren’t afraid of tedious work.

Retired Chicago cop Donna Kenny: “My first experience with postal inspectors was in 1987. I answered a call to ‘see the mother about the mailman,’” Kenny remembered. “The mother thought the mailman was flirting with her 12-year-old daughter.”

“I was very new and I eventually wound up contacting the postal inspectors. I’d never heard of them before.”

The inspectors met Kenny at the mother’s house to compile some information. While they did that, they asked Kenny to earn the girl’s confidence. She did.

“She told me she had sex with the 36-year-old mailman who said he wanted to marry her.”

That was day one.

The next morning after roll call, Kenny was called into a meeting.

“The postal inspectors dropped a thick 3-ring binder on the desk and said, ‘Come with us.’”

“They had spent the whole night interviewing the whole neighborhood, getting the mailman’s personnel record which included previous complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior with minors and the report from the emergency room, where I had taken the girl the day before. I didn’t even realize there was an emergency room doctor’s report.”

Kenny worked side-by-side with the inspectors, shepherding the girl through meetings with detectives and prosecutors.

“I learned so much in those few days and I was grateful for the education on how to do things properly from start to finish. To this day, they are two of the best cops I ever worked with.”

New Developments

Two Lakeview brothers who were previously considered “persons of interest” in Smollett’s purported attack told police during interrogations last week that Smollett staged the hate crime because he was upset that the threat letter did not get enough attention, ABC7 Chicago reported Monday afternoon. Detectives are investigating their claim.

Meanwhile, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has been quietly working on the origins of Smollett’s letter for nearly a month. Giving it far more “attention” than he knew.

Late Monday, CWBChicago received confirmation that the letter case has been before a federal grand jury and multiple subpoenas have been generated over the course of the investigation.

In a conversation on Feb. 8th, before police met with brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, a leading source within the Smollett attack investigation called the hate crime a “false flag”and said “There is a direct line between (the letter) and (the purported attack).” In the same conversation, the source hinted at what was to come: “This is not a whodunit. It’s a how-many-people-dunit.”

Whoever mailed the letter “made an enormous mistake,” we were told. Federal charges were “certain.”

Very good source on @JussieSmollett hate crime investigation: ""This is not a whodunit. It's a how-many-people-dunit."" Threat letter is a ""direct"" link to purported attack. #jussiesmollett #Chicago — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) February 11, 2019

A law firm partner who asked not to be identified by name spoke with us about the federal problems ahead for whoever mailed the letter: “If they have Smollett on the letter, he’ll be facing ’terroristic hoax’ charges, a felony. There may be federal obstruction charges as well.”

All in all, the federal legal options are numerous: “If they want to bury him, they can.”

Meanwhile, the Osundairo brothers are reportedly holed up in a Chicago hotel with police protection.

Attack location identified

One piece of housekeeping: CWBChicago has confirmed with Chicago police that Smollett told responding officers that he was attacked on the southwest corner of New Street and Lower East North Water Street.

Previous reporting had the attack taking place across the street and slightly west, in an area where Lower East North Water Street is covered by an upper traffic deck.

The correct location was confirmed by information contained in dispatch records for a Chicago Police Department evidence technician who was assigned to process the purported crime scene shortly after Smollett reported the attack to police. CWBChicago sought the dispatch records after noticing that the Chicago Police Department’s original case report of the purported attack lists the address of occurrence as “341 E Lower North Water St”—that’s across the street and slightly east of Smollett’s home.

On Saturday, a 30-year-old woman who lives in a high-rise that overlooks the purported crime scene told CWBChicago that she believes she saw the events that Smollett described to police as a violent hate crime.

The woman said she returned to her apartment early on Jan. 29th after helping a friend move from the Gold Coast to Lincoln Park. “It was cold and everyone bailed on him, so it took forever,” she said.

Upon returning home, the woman saw three men standing on the corner where Smollett would later report being attacked.

“All I saw was three guys talking,” she said. “They were standing right before the staircase” that leads to Upper East North Water Street.

“I don’t think there was any problem because it looked like they knew each other.”

And she said, as she looked down on the men through her open bedroom window, she did not hear any screaming or slurs. “I heard trucks (two blocks away) on Michigan Avenue, but I didn’t hear anything from them.”

If the woman is right, she estimates that the actual timeline for the crime as known to the public is off. “10, 15, maybe 20 minutes off,” she said.

So, why’d she have her window open so early on a frigid Tuesday morning?

“Because I was smoking pot,” she laughed. “That’s why I haven’t talked to the cops, too.”"

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.

“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”

Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. But he also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.

“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.

“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.

Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.

“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”

Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.

“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.”

CHICAGO, Feb 20 — US detectives are investigating a tip that on the night gay black actor Jussie Smollett reported being beaten in a hate-motivated attack he was in an elevator with two brothers later arrested in the probe.

The 36-year-old star of TV drama Empire told police on Jan 29 that two masked men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck on the streets of downtown Chicago.

Public figures including Emma Watson, Katy Perry, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden led an outpouring of sympathy for Smollett, with Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker decrying “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

President Donald Trump commented that the alleged attack was “horrible.”

Now police say they want to speak to the actor again after two “potential suspects” were released without charge, with US media outlets reporting that the attack may have been staged.

Smollett, who has hired a prominent criminal defence attorney, said his assailants used racial and homophobic slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country” — a reference to Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan.

But Chicago TV station WBBM reported that the suspects claimed Smollett hired them to stage the attack, because he was unhappy that a threatening letter he had earlier received had not gotten enough attention.

Chicago Police spokeswoman Jessica Rocco told AFP detectives had received a tip that the suspects were seen with Smollett in the elevator of his apartment building on the night of the incident.

Police are working to confirm the tip, said Rocco, who would not reveal whether there was video evidence.

“We do not have any further details at this time,” Rocco told AFP.

The suspects were identified as brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who had ties to Smollett, according to US media.

The probe could be handed to a grand jury this week, according to the celebrity news website TMZ, which reported yesterday that the actor’s role on Empire has been curtailed.

Fox declined to comment. — AFP

But now, in a twist more sensational than anything portrayed onscreen, cops say the gay black actor PAID two friends to carry out the “attack” in Chicago last month.

Detectives will now quiz him after suggesting he staged the elaborate assault, possibly in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

A Grand Jury, which decides whether someone should be indicted for a serious crime, was notified it would hear testimony as early as this week alleging Smollett filed a false police report, according to law enforcement sources

Just days earlier, and before the shock twist in the story emerged, A-listers had flooded social media with their ­support for the 36-year-old.

COPS WANT TO QUIZ ACTOR

Brit catwalk queen Naomi Campbell — who previously starred in hip-hop drama Empire — was one of the first to leap to Smollett’s defence.

Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on Chicago’s mayor to catch the “despicable people” who had committed this “act of hate”.

Oscar-winner Viola Davis also shared a photo of the actor on Instagram, saying: “OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate!

“We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved!”

OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate! Oscar-winner Viola Davis

And TV host Ellen DeGeneres, referring to an interview when the actor revealed he was gay, said: “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

Smollett, who was treated in hospital, had told cops his white “attackers” were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and made reference to “MAGA” — the “Make America Great Again” election catchphrase used by President Trump.

On Thursday last week, he gave a tearful US TV interview where he described being set upon at 2am while speaking to his manager on his phone after leaving his apartment to get food.

'THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY' CLAIM

He told Good Morning America interviewer Robin Roberts: “While I was on the phone I heard . . . I was crossing the intersection . . . I heard ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire.”

Smollett, who first rose to prominence in 1992 children’s movie The Mighty Ducks, then said he heard one of them utter a racial slur. He said: “So I turned around and said, ‘What the f*** did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker masked.”

Getting emotional, Smollett continued: “He said: ‘This MAGA country n*****’. And he punched me in the face so I punched his ass back.”

There is a f***ing rope around my neck Jussie Smollett

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back. Smollett claimed the attackers ran off then saw his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager Brandon Moore was still on the line and Smollett said he told Brandon he had been jumped.

Then, looking down, Smollett claimed he saw a rope. He said: “I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck.’ ”

Choking up, Smollett added: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

But some people had early doubts about the authenticity of the attack — and why the star refused to hand over his phone to detectives.

Cops were also curious as to why he still had the rope around his neck when they arrived on the scene 30 minutes after the attack. He also asked responding officers to turn off their body cameras and come into his apartment — because he said he did not want neighbours witnessing the scene.

Expressing frustration, Smollett told Roberts: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.” Smollett insisted he was targeted because of his vocal criticism of Trump, the 45th US President.

COPS BELIEVE SMOLLETT PAID MEN TO 'ATTACK' HIM

In his TV interview, he added: “I come really hard against 45.”

But his story seemingly unravelled after cops arrested two black men with connections to him.

Brothers Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, 25, were held on Wednesday after leaving the US for a holiday just days after the alleged attack. Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

It appears that Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad Donald Trump Jr

A Chicago police spokesman said: “The information received from the individuals questioned earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Cops are now understood to believe the star paid the men £2,700 to attack him and £390 when they returned from Nigeria.

They reportedly have proof that Smollett directed his “attackers” to buy the rope used in the “assault” at a local store. Sources told website TMZ the trio even REHEARSED the assault. Following their release, the two brothers would only say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump.”

Jussie Smollett says there has never been a 'closet to come out from' on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

Smollett has hastily appointed a lawyer, ironically one who represented Trump’s jailed former fixer Michael Cohen.

But many are now asking why Smollett would invent the whole thing. Trump’s son Donald Jr tweeted: “It appears that Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad.”

It is also suggested Smollett wanted to raise his profile because his gay character Jamal Lyon was being written out of Empire, which airs in the UK on channel 5Star.

The show’s fifth series has been promoting the death of a major ­character, with shots of lead character Lucious Lyon — Smollett’s dad in the show — standing next to a coffin.

'MAKE TRUMP SUPPORTERS LOOK BAD'

But programme bosses refuted the claim. Co-creator Danny Strong said: “There is zero per cent truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire.”

Another theory is that Smollett might have staged the attack because a threatening letter he said he received the week before was not given enough police attention.

A photo of the letter mysteriously emerged online after the actor mentioned it for the first time in his emotional TV interview.

It contained “a powdery substance”, which was ruled to be aspirin or another ­painkiller. On it were the words “You will die black f***”, spelled out in cut-and-pasted letters, and “MAGA” scrawled in red pen.

Speaking to TV host Roberts, Smollett added: “Did I make that up too?” Cops are now investigating whether that was the case.

Smollett’s solicitors said in an early statement: “As a victim of a hate crime, Jussie is angered . . . he has now been victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.”

Empire is set to return to screens in March. Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the penultimate episode — which is being shot now — but five scenes have now reportedly been cut.

As the questions mount, Smollett is now facing the role of his life.

Two brothers who said the actor paid them to stage an attack on him were talking to prosecutors, sources told CBS News.

The brothers spent the afternoon at the Cook County courthouse, where a grand jury was deliberating. It's a possible sign of increasing legal peril for the actor who says he was assaulted three weeks ago.

It was not immediately clear if they had actually testified yet, but they are expected to, according to sources. That could lead to an indictment of 36-year old Smollett.

Police said the two brothers said during interrogation last week that Smollett paid for them to fake an attack. While initially the two were considered possible suspects, their cooperation has led the investigation in the direction of Smollett himself.

The actor said he was beaten in an unprovoked attack by two men yelling homophobic and racist slurs. He said they doused him with a chemical, draped a noose around his neck and yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" all as he was walking from a restaurant at 2 a.m. in 10 degree weather.

Smollett initially granted interviews to police but in recent days has declined repeated requests to meet again with detectives.

Smollett's legal team said Tuesday, ""we are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner."""

But now, in a twist more sensational than anything portrayed onscreen, cops say the gay black actor PAID two friends to carry out the “attack” in Chicago last month.

Detectives will now quiz him after suggesting he staged the elaborate assault, possibly in a bizarre bid to boost his career.

A Grand Jury, which decides whether someone should be indicted for a serious crime, was notified it would hear testimony as early as this week alleging Smollett filed a false police report, according to law enforcement sources

Just days earlier, and before the shock twist in the story emerged, A-listers had flooded social media with their ­support for the 36-year-old.

COPS WANT TO QUIZ ACTOR

Brit catwalk queen Naomi Campbell — who previously starred in hip-hop drama Empire — was one of the first to leap to Smollett’s defence.

Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on Chicago’s mayor to catch the “despicable people” who had committed this “act of hate”.

Oscar-winner Viola Davis also shared a photo of the actor on Instagram, saying: “OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate!

“We ALL have to take this racist and homophobic act of violence very personally! My arms are around you @jussiesmollett. You are loved!”

OMG!! This is why the LGBTQ community continue to fight to be seen and protected against hate! Oscar-winner Viola Davis

And TV host Ellen DeGeneres, referring to an interview when the actor revealed he was gay, said: “Four years ago, @JussieSmollett came out on my show. I’m sending him and his family so much love today.”

Smollett, who was treated in hospital, had told cops his white “attackers” were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” and made reference to “MAGA” — the “Make America Great Again” election catchphrase used by President Trump.

On Thursday last week, he gave a tearful US TV interview where he described being set upon at 2am while speaking to his manager on his phone after leaving his apartment to get food.

'THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY' CLAIM

He told Good Morning America interviewer Robin Roberts: “While I was on the phone I heard . . . I was crossing the intersection . . . I heard ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire. My name ain’t Empire.”

Smollett, who first rose to prominence in 1992 children’s movie The Mighty Ducks, then said he heard one of them utter a racial slur. He said: “So I turned around and said, ‘What the f*** did you just say to me?’ I see the attacker masked.”

Getting emotional, Smollett continued: “He said: ‘This MAGA country n*****’. And he punched me in the face so I punched his ass back.”

There is a f***ing rope around my neck Jussie Smollett

Smollett said they started tussling and ended up near some stairs, as a second person kicked him in his back. Smollett claimed the attackers ran off then saw his phone had fallen out of his pocket.

His manager Brandon Moore was still on the line and Smollett said he told Brandon he had been jumped.

Then, looking down, Smollett claimed he saw a rope. He said: “I noticed the rope around my neck and I started screaming: ‘There is a f***ing rope around my neck.’ ”

Choking up, Smollett added: “I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.”

But some people had early doubts about the authenticity of the attack — and why the star refused to hand over his phone to detectives.

Cops were also curious as to why he still had the rope around his neck when they arrived on the scene 30 minutes after the attack. He also asked responding officers to turn off their body cameras and come into his apartment — because he said he did not want neighbours witnessing the scene.

Expressing frustration, Smollett told Roberts: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.” Smollett insisted he was targeted because of his vocal criticism of Trump, the 45th US President.

COPS BELIEVE SMOLLETT PAID MEN TO 'ATTACK' HIM

In his TV interview, he added: “I come really hard against 45.”

But his story seemingly unravelled after cops arrested two black men with connections to him.

Brothers Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, 25, were held on Wednesday after leaving the US for a holiday just days after the alleged attack. Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

It appears that Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad Donald Trump Jr

A Chicago police spokesman said: “The information received from the individuals questioned earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Cops are now understood to believe the star paid the men £2,700 to attack him and £390 when they returned from Nigeria.

They reportedly have proof that Smollett directed his “attackers” to buy the rope used in the “assault” at a local store. Sources told website TMZ the trio even REHEARSED the assault. Following their release, the two brothers would only say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump.”

Jussie Smollett says there has never been a 'closet to come out from' on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

Smollett has hastily appointed a lawyer, ironically one who represented Trump’s jailed former fixer Michael Cohen.

But many are now asking why Smollett would invent the whole thing. Trump’s son Donald Jr tweeted: “It appears that Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad.”

It is also suggested Smollett wanted to raise his profile because his gay character Jamal Lyon was being written out of Empire, which airs in the UK on channel 5Star.

The show’s fifth series has been promoting the death of a major ­character, with shots of lead character Lucious Lyon — Smollett’s dad in the show — standing next to a coffin.

'MAKE TRUMP SUPPORTERS LOOK BAD'

But programme bosses refuted the claim. Co-creator Danny Strong said: “There is zero per cent truth that @JussieSmollett was going to be written off of Empire.”

Another theory is that Smollett might have staged the attack because a threatening letter he said he received the week before was not given enough police attention.

A photo of the letter mysteriously emerged online after the actor mentioned it for the first time in his emotional TV interview.

It contained “a powdery substance”, which was ruled to be aspirin or another ­painkiller. On it were the words “You will die black f***”, spelled out in cut-and-pasted letters, and “MAGA” scrawled in red pen.

Speaking to TV host Roberts, Smollett added: “Did I make that up too?” Cops are now investigating whether that was the case.

Smollett’s solicitors said in an early statement: “As a victim of a hate crime, Jussie is angered . . . he has now been victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.”

As the questions mount, Smollett is now facing the role of his life.

According to numerous sources who spoke to both TMZ and Deadline, writers have been told to make last minute changes to scripts in order to minimize scenes involving Smollett:

Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d.

As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.

With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we’re told Jussie’s working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

Thegatewaypundit.com reports: It is also being reported that Jussie Smollett’s case may be heading to a grand jury as early as Tuesday.

The evidence presented could lead to a felony indictment against Jussie Smollett for filing a false police report.

On January 29th, Jussie Smollett told Chicago Police that two white Trump supporters ambushed him on the streets of Chicago at 2 AM while he was walking back to his apartment following a midnight run to Subway to grab a sandwich.

Smollett alleged the two white males recognized him as the actor from ‘Empire,’ hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.

The hate hoax began to unravel after it was revealed two Nigerian brothers, who were also extras on Empire were paid $4,000 to stage the attack.

It is also being reported that Smollett and the Nigerian brothers were behind that racist threatening letter sent to Empire’s Chicago studio.

Jussie Smollett could face up to three years in prison for filing a false police report in the state of Illinois, a class 4 four felony."

A resident or someone visiting Smollett’s Chicago apartment told the cops that they saw the actor in the elevator with Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo late in the night of the assault. Now confirmed to have known Smollett socially as an Empire extra and a personal trainer, the brothers were picked up by the police on February 13 and questioned for 48 hours before being released without charges.

The incident was originally described as a racist and homophobic barrage that left the openly gay Smollett beaten, drenched in bleach and with a rope slung around his neck. Previously identified as the individuals in the photos of “persons of interest” in the Smollett case, the Osundario siblings are now said to be “fully” cooperating with authorities, according to one law enforcement source.

Related Story Jussie Smollett Cut From 'Empire' Episodes As Attack Probe Continues

However, this tip about the trio being seen together fell fast from fact, as Chicago police spokesman Anthony Gugliemi announced on social media this afternoon:

CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives. — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 19, 2019

This short-lived new turn in the CPD probe comes as Smollett’s team has been in contact with Hollywood lawyer Mark Geragos “the last couple of days,” a source told Deadline on Tuesday.

There is no formal agreement between the two sides at present, we’re told, but such a move would bring the high-profile attorney into Smollett’s camp amid a swirl of conflicting accounts of an alleged attack on the Empire actor last month. Currently represented by Chicago defense attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, Smollett and everyone else could have seen the high profile Geragos using his pundit platform to basically audition for the gig on a CNN appearance on Monday night where the the lawyer offered a spirited rallying for the actor.

Right now, Smollett’s legal team, with or without Geragos, are standing arm-in-arm to keep their client from another formal session with the CPD.

Though there has been no sit-down scheduled despite repeated requests by the Chicago police, the department continues asking lawyers and reps for the actor for a chance to be able to talk to Smollett again. As suspicion and the spotlight of the investigation seems now to be centering on Smollett himself, the CPD want more information about what happened in the early hours of January 29, when two men reportedly attacked the Empire star near his Windy City his apartment.

Now, based on information obtained from the Osundario brothers and others, the CPD are seeking knowledge whether the attack might have been preplanned and with an agenda.

Speaking on Good Morning America on February 14 in his first interview since the January 29 incident, Smollett said he thought the attack occurred because of his high profile criticism of the former Celebrity Apprentice host. “I come really, really hard against 45,” the actor told GMA co-host Robin Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue,” Smollett added of the President who called the attack on him “horrible” a coupe of days after it occurred.

Meanwhile, Empire producers are cutting Smollett’s scenes from the episodes that are in production this week and going forward, according to sources. Just over a week ago, Fox and others connected with the show strongly rejected the notion that Smollett was being written off Empire, which some local Chicago media floated as a reason the attack may have be orchestrated. Now, even with the renewed support for Smollett from Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney on February 17, Fox has been noticeably quiet about the future of the actor on the show.

Empire returns for its second half of its fifth season on March 13 – by which time, if it isn’t resolved, this case will have shifted several more times you can rest assured."

The two men whose names are Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundair, were released by officers and later questioned where they claim Smollett paid them $3,500 to orchestrate the attack.

According to Chicago Police Department Spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi, a person who either lives in the same building as Smollett or was visiting another resident on the same night of the attack eyed the three men together in the elevator.

Smollett’s initial reports claimed two white men were the assailants of a violent racist, homophobic attack where he was called the n-word, suffered bleach being thrown on his person while his attackers yelled “MAGA country” and hung a noose around his neck. But heads quickly turned after the Osundairo brothers, who are Black, were named as “persons of interest,” and Smollett’s submission of a redacted PDF of phone records.

Police are requesting to speak with Smollett as soon as possible, claiming the “investigation has shifted,” due to the Osundair’s allegations. Smollett has not publicly spoken since his Good Morning America interview, but his lawyers allege the new developments have created an atmosphere of victimization, and deny the actor staged his own attack.

The details of the attack and the information released by the Chicago Police Department over the last two weeks continues to cause a heated debate on social media over those who believe Smollett and are weary of the Chicago Police Department’s troubled history, and those who unabashedly believe Smollett was complicit in planning the attack against himself."

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Outrage Over Jussie Smollett Attacked Has Switched Sides

The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again. Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”"

CHICAGO - The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

8:25 p.m.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanour complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

4:50 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says two brothers who were arrested and later released from custody in connection with the attack reported by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett have met with police and prosecutors at the courthouse.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the meeting happened Tuesday in Chicago. He also said that officers have determined a tip that the two men may have been in an elevator with Smollett last month was not credible. He said video evidence helped them make that determination.

Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

12:10 p.m.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven't confirmed the person's account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

“The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at ‘Empire’s’ Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack,” ABC News reported, after confirming with two federal officials. “The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.”

On Monday, CBS News reported that the attack on Smollett was allegedly concocted because Smollett was upset that the incident involving the letter did not get a “bigger reaction.”

In a separate development, Chicago Police “are investigating a tip that on the night ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe,” the Associated Press reported.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that tip came from someone who either lived in the building or was visiting someone in the building at the time.

The news comes as the brothers and their attorney left court where they were expected to testify against Smollett in front of a grand jury.

Brothers and attorney Gloria Schmidt just left grand jury room. Brothers were expected to testify against Jussie Smollett @cbschicago — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) February 19, 2019

The Daily Mail reported on Monday that Smollett had participated in a play that was similar to the alleged attack hours before the attack happened.

“He had been in New York City for a reading of the play Take Me Out, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Smollett was being considered to appear in a possible revival of the Tony-winning production about a biracial baseball star who comes out as gay,” The Daily Mail reported. “The script for that play finds the lead character being attacked by a new pitcher who joins the team. That character uses the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‘f****t’ and ‘n****r.'”

Over the weekend, TMZ reported that Chicago law enforcement officials were suspicious of Smollett early on in their investigation:

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Also on Monday, The Blast reported that whoever sent the letter to Smollett could receive up to five years in prison, if convicted. The Blast reported that the charge would be “mailing threatening communications,” which states:"

It was also reported that the two men were recorded in a car from a ride-sharing app, presumably on their way to the scene of the incident. The Osundairos seemed nervous during the car ride, sources told CBS.

Last month, Smollett reported to police that he was attacked in the early morning hours of January 29, when two men approached him and attacked him on the street in Chicago near his home telling yelling “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett said the men also slipped a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance onto him while calling him racial and homophobic slurs, which prompted a hate crime investigation by local law enforcement. Chicago police took two men into custody on Wednesday but they were released Friday evening. Since the brothers went into police custody, more information has come out alluding to Smollett potentially orchestrating his own attack. CNN reported on Saturday that at least one of the brothers reportedly worked on Empire as an extra, and are now fully cooperating with law enforcement.

The brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, says they have provided evidence to Chicago PD to corroborate that Smollett was involved in purchasing the rope, according to CBS. New details published Saturday by CBS say the men were paid $3,500 by Smollett to stage the attack, which they had rehearsed days prior. After the attack, the brothers fled for Nigeria and returned days later. They say Smollett was supposed to pay them an additional $500 upon their return, CBS reports.

A spokesperson for the department told CBS after the bothers were released that the detectives on the case “have additional investigative work to complete.” The Advocate reports that Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys to represent him in light of allegations that the attack may have been coordinated. According to a spokesperson for Smollett, one of the brothers was Smollett's personal trainer, and therefore, ""it is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

The story of the attack also brought on doubt from others. Earlier this week, Smollett responded through a spokesperson to rumors that he may have been lying about the attack in a statement saying that he “is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police.”

Though Smollett’s case has been met by skepticism by some, hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people are generally on the rise and have become more severe. Shortly after news of the attack broke in late January, the New York City Anti-Violence Project released a statement emphasizing that “Jussie is not alone” in his experience. Gay Black men are among “some of the most vulnerable to violence in the LGBTQ community.”

According to the latest numbers from the FBI, previously reported by Out, the number of hate crimes reported nationwide rose from 6,121 in 2016 to 7,175 in 2017. The most common types of hate crime incidents were based on the victim’s race (59.6%), religion (20.6%), and sexual orientation (15.8%). Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported, 7,106 were single-bias incidents while 69 were based on more than one bias.

At first, the public was empathetic, hoping that he finds justice and that his attackers are sentenced appropriately. Then, it came out that the two brothers that jumped him were extras on Empire and friends with the actor. It's all so absurd but here we are...

The Chicago Police Department has been actively sharing updates on the case, and some are hoping that they keep that same energy for cases not involving famous actors. Kenan Thompson recently spoke on the matter with AP, saying that he wishes he knew the truth about what's happening. ""That story is so crazy,"" said the comedian. ""Now it's coming out that he might have set it up or whatever so I wish I knew what the truth was because everybody's so quick to jump on one side or the other before the actual facts come out.""

Kenan Thompson had reached out to Smollett when he first heard about the attack. Now, he's not too sure what to think. Which side do you stand on?

Police said they want to talk to Smollett, but so far, he's refused.

Chicago police said Smollett is no longer considered a victim in the case, but he's also not a suspect. He's wanted for more questioning.

""If he doesn't submit to reinterviewing by the police then there are going to be legit questions asked about the veracity of his allegations,"" retired FBI agent Bobby Chacon said.

His allegations of a hate crime are under scrutiny after police sources said the men Smollett identified in a grainy surveillance video of his attackers rebuked the actor's story and were released from custody over the holiday weekend.

""Innocence prevailed,"" attorney Glorida Schmidt said. ""My guys are walking home. They're not charged. They are not suspects in this case.""

Brothers Ola Osundairo and Abel Osundairo told detectives they were hired to stage the attack, according to police sources. The incident included racist and homophobic slurs by Smollett, police said.

Chicago police told NBC News that detectives are investigating a tip that the three men were seen together in an elevator of Smollett's apartment building on the night of the alleged attack.

Smollett has publicly denied that he lied about being attacked.

Investigators are now examining all communication between Smollett and the brothers, one of whom was his personal trainer and appeared as an extra on ""Empire."""

CHICAGO - The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

8:25 p.m.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanour complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

4:50 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says two brothers who were arrested and later released from custody in connection with the attack reported by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett have met with police and prosecutors at the courthouse.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the meeting happened Tuesday in Chicago. He also said that officers have determined a tip that the two men may have been in an elevator with Smollett last month was not credible. He said video evidence helped them make that determination.

Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

12:10 p.m.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven't confirmed the person's account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

PUTIN' THE INTERNET IN A TIGHTER GRIP: Russia is taking steps to tighten its grip on the internet within its borders, as the nation's legislature advanced legislation that would test temporarily disconnecting Russia from the global internet.

The first version of the bill was approved by the legislature on Tuesday. It still has two more steps to go before it gets final approval.

The bill would require that all internet traffic move through servers physically based in Russia. And it will expand the state-run communications office to oversee that routing.

In a separate move, the Kremlin has also announced that it is planning to build its own version of the Domain Name System (DNS), the records systems used for the internet to direct users to specific domains for websites.

Both decisions are raising eyebrows on Capitol Hill.

""I think it's rich that Russia is that concerned about"" cyberattacks, said Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersThe Hill's Morning Report - Capitol Hill weighs action on racial justice as protests carry on Bottom line Officials warn Chinese hackers targeting groups developing coronavirus treatments MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee.

Others labeled it an attempt to crack down on Russian citizens' internet access.

""The United States should condemn any action by Russia to tighten government control of the internet and prop up its authoritarian regime,"" Senate Intelligence Committee member Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOVERNIGHT ENERGY: Internal watchdog probing Park Police actions toward Lafayette Square protesters | Democrats detail their .5T green infrastructure plan | Green groups challenge Trump water rules rollback Internal watchdog probing Park Police actions toward Lafayette Square protesters IRS used cell phone data to try to track potential suspects: report MORE (D-Ore.) said in a statement to The Hill.

""The Trump Administration needs a strategy for addressing barriers to free speech and commerce online, from China's Great Firewall to the latest threat from Russia,"" he added.

Russia has been a leading aggressor in cyberspace.

In a threat assessment released last month, the Office of Director of National Intelligence labeled Russia a ""highly capable and effective adversary, integrating cyber espionage, attack, and influence operations to achieve its political and military objectives.""

Gen. Paul Nakasone, the director of U.S. Cyber Command, said in testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday that Russia ""certainly provides a very sophisticated threat to our nation,"" adding that they had been a threat for several years.

Russian media has described the policy as at least partly in response to the U.S.'s new cyber strategy, which was released last year. National security adviser John Bolton said at the time of the strategy's launch that the United States would take on a more offensive posture in cyberspace.

ICYMI ON MONDAY: Iran and China have been carrying out increasingly more aggressive cyberattacks in recent months, The New York Times reported Monday.

Dozens of U.S. entities -- including banks, businesses and government agencies -- have been targeted in what experts have attributed as an Iranian hacking campaign, multiple sources told the Times.

The hostile attacks, which analysts at the National Security Agency and experts at the security firm FireEye linked back to Iran, pushed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue an emergency order last month in response, which took place during the record-long partial government shutdown, according to the report.

A spokesperson for FireEye declined to comment, and a spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Iranian hackers reportedly had become far less active after the Obama administration signed the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2015. The new Iran-attributed cyber activity is believed to be linked to President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE's decision to pull out of the deal.

At the same time Iran is becoming more bold in its cyber operations against the U.S., so too is China as it seeks to steal trade and military secrets through cyber means, the Times reported, citing sources that include intelligence officials, lawyers and private security researchers.

News of their growing offensive efforts, which has been largely directed at technology companies and contractors for the Pentagon, comes four years after China had scaled back its cyber espionage efforts following an agreement between then-President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping to stop cyberattacks aimed at stealing trade secrets.

After the deal, China largely slowed its cyber espionage efforts for more than a year, but the Times reports that they are now amping up their hacking efforts as Beijing seeks to gain the leading edge in developing artificial intelligence and other sophisticated technologies, as laid out in China's five-year plan.

HARRIS FOR PAPER BALLOTS: Sen.

Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines MORE (D-Calif.) on Tuesday issued a call for states to focus on election security and possibly adopt paper ballot measures, telling a crowd of New Hampshire voters that paper ballots remain the securest way to cast votes.

Speaking at the ""Politics & Eggs"" breakfast in New Hampshire, the 2020 Democratic contender told attendees that her infrastructure plan as president would include investments in election security at the state level.

""We have proposed that part of the investment in infrastructure has to be upgrading the infrastructure of states around elections,"" Harris said Tuesday. ""Because guess what? As it turns out, for all that technology has brought us, good and bad, the best way to conduct secure elections? Paper ballots.""

""'Cause, the way I kind of say it, half joking, is 'Russia can't hack a piece of paper,' "" Harris added.

CUE SHAGGY'S, 'IT WASN'T ME': The founder and CEO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei denies in a new interview that his company poses a security threat to the U.S. and has dismissed allegations of links to the Chinese government.

In his first interview with a U.S. outlet, Ren Zhengfei told CBS News that Huawei has never provided information to the Chinese government and never will, according to a clip that aired Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning."" He also denied that Beijing could have backdoor access to the company's technology.

""It is not possible,"" Ren said. ""Because across our entire organization, we've stressed once and again that we will never do that. If we did have that, with America's advanced technology, they would [have] found that already. So that proves we do not have it.""

Ren's comments come as President Trump is reportedly preparing to issue an executive order blocking companies like Huawei from next-generation wireless networks in the U.S. known as 5G.

In another interview with the BBC, the CEO also blasted the arrest of his daughter, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, and the Justice Department's indictments of her and the company. Late last month, the U.S. charged the company and its executives with violating sanctions against Iran and stealing intellectual property.

EXPOSED: A group of patients and health data experts is accusing Facebook of misleading users about how their personal health information can be manipulated and exposed without patients' explicit permission.

In a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint released publicly on Tuesday, the group alleges that Facebook prompts its users to join online medical support groups under the guise that they are ""private"" – but does not make clear that users could expose their health data when they join those groups.

""I think the highest-level deception is that they call [these medical support groups] safe,"" Fred Trotter, a security researcher and one of the complainants, told The Hill. He pointed out that Facebook executives, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergPatagonia becomes latest company to pull ads from Facebook The North Face pulls ads from Facebook Twitter flags Trump tweet featuring fake CNN chyron as 'manipulated media' MORE, have touted the medical support groups as an opportunity for patients to support one another, while failing to disclose that the group members' data could be mined for ad targeting and harassment.

Pallone and Schakowsky in a letter to Zuckerberg wrote that Facebook ""potentially misled Facebook users"" into sharing personal health information raises ""concerns about Facebook's privacy policies and practices.""

Facebook responds: A Facebook spokesperson in a statement to The Hill said the company looks forward to ""briefing the committee about how these products work.""

""It's intentionally clear to people that when they join any group on Facebook, other members of that group can see that they are a part of that community, and can see the posts they choose to share with that community,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

COMING CLEAN: Twitter announced Tuesday it will launch tools in the European Union (EU) aimed at promoting transparency over who pays for political ads on its platform and how those ads are promoted on users' feeds.

The social media giant said in a blog post that it will extend the strategies it used during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections to the EU, as well as to India and Australia ahead of elections in both of those countries.

The move comes shortly after the European Commission called on tech giants to step up their efforts in combatting fake news ahead of the European parliamentary elections in May.

The details: Twitter will now require political advertisers to go through a certification process before they are allowed to promote ads on the platform, and the social media company will offer users the option to explore details about the groups behind such ads.

The company said it will begin enforcing the new policies in the EU, India and Australia starting March 11.

""Only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads on our service [at that time],"" Twitter wrote in the blog post. ""Political advertisers must apply now for certification and go through the every step of the process.""

The tools will allow users to browse the billing information, demographic targeting and ad spending details behind each political advertisement.

It will also require political advertisers to prove that they are not a foreign entity seeking to interfere in regional elections.

AND GOING GREENER: Major online retailer Amazon is making a push to halve the carbon footprint of its shipments by 2030.

The company, which relies largely on shipping packages across the globe, said Monday it ultimately aims to make all its shipments carbon neutral.

The new push, titled ""Shipment Zero,"" ultimately aims to make all of the retailer's shipments have a carbon footprint of zero. The company says it plans to meet its 2030 goal by utilizing electric vans, using renewable energy sources such as solar power and pushing more retailers to reuse packaging. It also hopes the rise of aircraft biofuels will aid in its plan.

""It won't be easy to achieve this goal, but it's worth being focused and stubborn on this vision and we're committed to seeing it through,"" Amazon said in a statement.

NEED FOR SPEED: Russian threat actors are able to enter and then move through a targeted network significantly faster than actors from any other nation state, according to a new report released Tuesday.

Security firm CrowdStrike found that it takes Russian actors less than 19 minutes to move within a network that they've compromised. That's a major gap between those countries' actors and the next fastest-moving hackers out of North Korea, who generally take about two hours and 20 minutes to make their next move in a victim's system.

Chinese actors were found to be the next fastest, making lateral movements in a network about 4 hours after having initially compromised it.

The CrowdStrike report states that there may be several unknown reasons why a hacker might not immediately move once they've accessed a victim's network. But the researchers noted that cyber actors likely have to move faster to avoid being detected as technology improves.

QUITE TAXING: New Zealand's government is considering a plan to tax multinational tech corporations at a higher rate, citing a disparity between the taxes paid by New Zealanders and large corporations such as Facebook and Google.

The Associated Press reports that the plan could tax tech companies 2 to 3 percent on the revenue they generate in the country, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says is necessary to bring fairness to New Zealand's tax code.

""Our current tax system is not fair in the way that it treats individual taxpayers and the way that it treats multinationals,"" the prime minister said, according to the AP.

TECH TRIES TO LEARN FROM HQ2: Amazon's decision to scrap its plans for a second headquarters in New York City, dubbed HQ2, stunned both the tech world and its critics this week, raising new questions about the industry's ambitious expansion plans and their dealings with state and local governments.

Experts say Amazon's plans for New York were disrupted by the public backlash against large tax breaks for corporate America. And they say the company's case could draw new fault lines for other tech companies over the deals they strike and how they handle the publicity over their growth and wealth.

""Companies are going to be more cautious in how they go about negotiating these subsidy deals [after Amazon],"" Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told The Hill.

""I think it's unrealistic to think they're going to start turning down subsidies entirely,"" Davis added. ""But I think they're going to know that if they push too hard and ask for too much and word gets out, the public may not view that favorably.""

Activists in New York City pushed against Amazon for a number of reasons. They took issue with the tech company's business ties to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which they said was an affront to Queens' significant immigrant population. They said Amazon's new offices would drive up rents and displace poor residents. The labor-friendly city also balked when an Amazon executive said the company would not remain neutral if workers tried to unionize.

But local lawmakers and advocates expressed the most outrage over the public nature of Amazon's search for a second headquarters, which prompted New York City to offer $3 billion in state and city tax breaks to woo Amazon.

Predicting the fallout: But some tech watchers question how much of an impact the HQ2 debate will have.

ADVERTISEMENT

""Amazon said in its own statement that it's going to continue to grow in New York and that it isn't going to be looking for an HQ2,"" Mitchell told The Hill. ""They talked about these 25,000 jobs coming in over a 10-year timeline.""

""I wouldn't be that surprised to find in 10 years that they had 25,000 jobs in New York,"" Mitchell added.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the attack reported by Jussie Smollett (all times local):

8:25 p.m.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

4:50 p.m.

A Chicago police spokesman says two brothers who were arrested and later released from custody in connection with the attack reported by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have met with police and prosecutors at the courthouse.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the meeting happened Tuesday in Chicago. He also said that officers have determined a tip that the two men may have been in an elevator with Smollett last month was not credible. He said video evidence helped them make that determination.

Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

The Chicago Police Department said in a statement Friday night, ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charges and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

Since his TV interview with “Good Morning America,” new developments have emerged about Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack in Chicago.

Two men have been arrested, but not charged. The Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi told ""Extra"" Friday morning, “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Guglielmi added, “Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney. While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

In response to reports that the attack was staged by Smollett and the two men, Anthony tweeted on Thursday, “Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

While the police have not released names, CBS Chicago reported that the individuals who are being questioned are two brothers who worked on “Empire” with Smollett.

The men have been in custody since Wednesday night, the same day that the police raided their home. Their attorney, Glorida Schmidt, told CBS, “When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”"

In a week when the U.S. culture wars focused on actor Jussie Smollett’s reportedly false claim of being the victim of a hate crime and on Donald Trump calling immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a “national emergency,” people also were on Twitter fiercely debating John Wayne’s infamous, racially charged 1971 Playboy interview, during which he observed, “I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.”

While Wayne died nearly 40 years ago, the legendary actor was a No. 1 trending topic on Twitter from Monday night through Tuesday afternoon.

There were people who questioned whether there were more relevant issues to worry about than things Wayne said in 1971, and others who joked about whether Wayne would still be able to get work in Hollywood.

Glad to see John Wayne's offensive 1971 interview trending, but let's also take a moment to remember that King Henry VIII had two of his wives beheaded. Totally misogynistic. #CancelHenryVIII — Natalie Wynn 🦋 (@ContraPoints) February 19, 2019

Yet for others, Wayne’s legacy lives on — and not just at the Orange County airport named after him. For some, his comments are disturbingly relevant to discussions still taking place in 2019.

Journalist and author Glenn Greenwald joined in the Twitter debate about the interview, which you can read in full here. In his 2008 book, “Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics,” Greenwald said the staunchly Republican actor has long served as a template for right-wing notions of “American courage and conservative manliness,” Publishers Weekly reported.

That’s largely because Wayne played World War II heroes and stalwart figures of the American West in many of the more than 200 Hollywood films he made from 1926 to 1977.

Greenwald, a co-founder of The Intercept, tweeted: “I devoted a book chapter to John Wayne, a conservative icon & one of the 20th Century’s most deceitful & pitiful men. A supporter of McCarthy, war cheerleader & moralizer who casually impugned patriotism & called people perverts while draft-dodging & having serial drunken affairs.”

As Greenwald suggested, Wayne’s biography shows that Wayne was anything but a real-life war hero. Other critics argued Tuesday, as they have for decades, that Wayne was no model of physical courage or moral rectitude.

Wayne’s record included three marriages and affairs, apparently doing all he could to avoid military service in World War II, leading efforts to help U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunt down Communists in Hollywood and holding views about race that many say were retrograde in 1971.

In the Playboy interview, Wayne, then in his 60s and fresh off his Oscar win for “True Grit,” discussed a range of topics, from working in Hollywood to race and sex. One of the more noteworthy quotes in the interview came up in a discussion about African-American political activist and academic Angela Davis.

“With a lot of blacks, there’s quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so,” Wayne said. “But we can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”

Later in the interview, Wayne also said he didn’t feel “guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago (black) people were slaves.” Wayne continued: “Now, I’m not condoning slavery. It’s just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can’t play football with the rest of us.”

Wayne also decried “tokenism” in Hollywood. But he said he had been willing to give black actors opportunities in films he directed by hiring an actor to play “a black slave in ‘The Alamo'” and by having a “correct number of blacks in ‘The Green Berets.'”

Also in the interview, Wayne, whose Western films like “The Searchers” were accused of perpetuating stereotypes about Native Americans, accused Native Americans of “selfishly trying to keep (North America) to themselves.”

He also blasted Communists for teaching in American public schools and the depiction of gay sex in “Midnight Cowboy,” the 1970 best picture Oscar winner. Wayne used a homophobic slur to describe the characters played by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.

Matt Williams, a screenwriter who shared excerpts of the interview, wrote: “Jesus (expletive). John Wayne was a straight up piece of (expletive).”

Williams also pointed out that Wayne turned down a role in Mel Brooks’ Western spoof “Blazing Saddles” because the language was too “blue.”

Among those weighing in on Wayne’s interview were comedian Patton Oswalt, who addressed the actor’s quote that he gave African-American actors opportunities in his films.

“‘If it’s supposed to be a black character, naturally I use a black actor’ was as ‘woke’ as John Wayne got, I guess,” Oswalt tweeted.

Producer Joe Carnahan excoriated Wayne for being a war hawk, especially during the Vietnam War, even though he dodged service during World War II. Carnahan mentioned some of Wayne’s famous contemporaries who signed up to serve, including in combat units.

The Duke dodged service during WWII but was still a huge hawk. While Jimmy Stewart & Clark Gable were flying bombing runs over Berlin, Wayne was making fake war films. John Ford apparently tortured him on this point, repeatedly and ruthlessly.https://t.co/1vpf0udKa2 https://t.co/3Tau5h9Exy — Joe Carnahan (@carnojoe) February 18, 2019

Speaking of Wayne’s World War II record, Wayne started the war with a 3-A deferment from the draft for family dependency because he was the sole provider for.a family of four, DenofGeek.com and film historian Karina Longworth explained in her “You Must Remember This” podcast. But those family deferments were later recalled. Wayne then qualified for a 2-A deferment because he was in Hollywood, engaged in making morale-building films that were believed to serve an important propaganda purpose, Longworth said.

There are conflicting accounts about whether Wayne made a serious attempt to join some branch of the military service. He appeared interested in a position in a unit of the Office of Strategic Services, where director John Ford was making documentary and reconnaissance films, according to Longworth. Ford had made Wayne a star by casting him in “Stagecoach” in 1939.

But it also appears that Wayne kept putting off joining the unit, saying he needed to finish up his next set of films, Longworth added. Ford continued to let Wayne know he was disappointed in his failure to serve, saying he was getting rich making movies while other men died, according to the PBS documentary American Masters.

Wayne’s reluctance to leave Hollywood may have been due a torrid love affair he was having with occasional co-star Marlene Dietrich, according to writer Marc Eliot in his book, “American Titan: Searching for John Wayne.” Longworth also said he may have worried how a long absence from Hollywood would affect his career.

In any case, Wayne’s lack of military service was back on people’s minds Tuesday, as were his “white supremacy,” slavery and tokenism comments. Wayne had some defenders on Twitter who said his views are not that shocking when seen in the context of 1971.

But others insisted that times haven’t changed as much as others think.

“Seeing John Wayne complain about seeing gay relationships in movies and accusing diverse roles of “tokenism” pretty much tells me (expletive) hasn’t changed one bit,” wrote one person. Another said:

People are asking why is John Wayne’s self admitted white supremacists views being brought up after all these years. You realize there is an airport named after him here in Ca? — Tariq Nasheed 🇺🇸 (@tariqnasheed) February 19, 2019

But still others said it’s not useful to get worked up about Wayne’s comments when there are so many other “truly egregious” events to be concerned about:"

The FBI is working with the U.S. Postal Service to determine whether Empire actor Jussie Smollett sent himself a threatening letter in the days before the “hate crime” he is now under investigation for allegedly staging, two federal officials told ABC News Tuesday.

The two Nigerian brothers who told Chicago Police last week that Smollett paid them to stage a racially motivated attack on him have also told the authorities that Smollett sent himself the threatening letter that arrived on the Empire set on January 22, just seven days before they claim they conducted the hoax attack.

The brothers, one of whom worked as an extra on Empire, reportedly claimed that Smollett was motivated to stage the attack after his coworkers’ reaction to the letter did not live up to his expectations.

The letter, which was accompanied by crushed up aspirin, is now being analyzed at an FBI crime lab.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo agreed to cooperate with police last week after they were presented with evidence that they purchased the rope that Smollett claimed was placed around his neck by two attackers who yelled racist and homophobic slurs before shouting “this is MAGA country” as they fled.

Smollett’s attorneys maintain that he was attacked and have denied that he was complicit in staging the assault.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines MORE admitted during her recent appearance on “The Breakfast Club” radio show that she smoked pot in college. In an apparent effort to seem ‘cool’ for the hosts and audience, and making references to popular rap music, she went on to say, “I think it [marijuana] gives a lot of people joy. And we need more joy in the world.” Few would criticize Harris for smoking a joint in college, but her clear misunderstanding about the differences between today’s high-potency, commercialized marijuana and her college joint, are alarming. It demonstrates just how effective ‘Big Marijuana’ lobbyists have been at convincing politicians that legalizing weed is no big deal.

The senator is surely not alone in her misperceptions about weed. For most people marijuana conjures up images of carefree Woodstock hippies. They say, “I tried it and I turned out fine. Legalizing a little pot won’t hurt anyone.” However, there is strong scientific evidence demonstrating today’s pot brings greater risk of mental illness, increased youth use and more drugged-driving deaths.

Before any candidate expresses support for legalization and commercialization of marijuana, especially those seeking the presidency, they should learn more about the significant health, fiscal and other societal impacts. Don’t be blind to the fact that today’s pot, with THC levels more than ten times what it was in the ‘70s and ‘80s. It’s big business.

Today’s marijuana is an industry, funded by billions from alcohol, Big Tobacco and Wall Street hedgefunders. Their goal is increased, regular use of gummies, candies, sodas, ice creams and concentrates containing up to 99 percent pure THC, the mind-altering chemical found in marijuana. That’s a far cry from the 5 percent THC of yesteryear.

Studies on low-potency marijuana, have shown that prolonged marijuana use can affect the human brain. For instance, we know it can severely impact young people’s ability to learn, can lower IQ, and impairs memory. The causal link between regular pot consumption and serious mental illness, such as psychosis, depression and schizophrenia also becoming increasingly clear. We also know that pot can impair judgement, motor skills, and reaction time, making it incredibly dangerous to use prior to getting behind the wheel or performing at work.

That’s low-potency THC. We should assume commercialized products that are as much as 90 percent THC will have significant long-term effects on the brain, body and society.

Joy certainly isn’t what Corinne LaMarca Gasper feels of when she thinks of weed. Her 22-year-old daughter, Jennifer, was killed by a driver under the influence of marijuana.

Andy Zorn, was a courageous veteran who served our nation in Iraq. Pot didn’t bring him joy. His suicide note read in part, “My soul is already dead. Marijuana killed my soul + ruined my brain.”

One would think Harris and other national politicians would also realize that the pot industry, like the big tobacco and alcohol industries before it, is preying on the low-income and communities of color. One need only look at the clusters of pot shops in minority neighborhoods in Denver to see that.

Before she was running for president, Harris stated that, “we need to research the impact of weed on a developing brain” and institute standards for impairment to address and enforce marijuana impaired driving. What happened?

The scientific data and the first-hand accounts show that marijuana is indeed a harmful substance and numerous lives have already been irrevocably changed by this industry. If Harris and other 2020 candidates want to show leadership, they should be honest with Americans about the dangers of another Big Tobacco, rather than send mixed messages to our young people or ignore science.

Lawmakers, especially the 2020 presidential candidates, should learn the real science about today’s marijuana, instead of glamorizing its use to the very youth we need to engage.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, told Entertainment Weekly: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

‘He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

His lawyers now say that one of men was Smollett’s personal trainer for a music video. They added: ‘One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

‘It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.’

The stunning turn of events saw the two men involved in the alleged hoax now fully cooperating with law enforcement, CNN reported Saturday.

On January 29, two men ‘yelled out racial and homophobic slurs’ while attacking Smollett, the actor told police.

One of the assailants tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, Smollett claimed at the time.

Smollett’s claim that his attackers shouted “this is MAGA country” became the lynchpin of the ensuing coverage. Since the alleged incident was first reported on January 29, the three major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) have repeated the line “MAGA country” 28 times on their morning and evening news shows.

During an NPR interview on February 1, The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart explained the media mindset, saying the “MAGA country” allegation illustrated “the atmosphere of menace that African Americans in particular, and people of color in general, have felt since the advent of the Trump Administration.”

Once Smollett’s credibility had all but evaporated, Capehart used the same language to retroactively justify the media’s credulous reporting. During the 10:00 a.m. Eastern hour of MSNBC Live on February 18, he rationalized:

What he said happened to him sort of fit in with a narrative — not a narrative, but a reality, for a lot of people in this country since President Trump was inaugurated: that there is an atmosphere of menace and an atmosphere of hate around the country that made it possible for people to either readily believe or want to believe Jussie Smollett.

In a January 31 segment on CBS This Morning, correspondent Dean Reynolds emphasized that the actor was “known for speaking out against racism and bigotry,” adding, “he is also a frequent critic of the President.”

As more time passed, reporters began to gloss over the fact that Smollett had not even mentioned the “MAGA country” comments in his first conversation with the police.

Reporters also repeated unconfirmed rumors linking the alleged attackers to President Trump. For example on January 29, NBC News correspondent Miguel Almaguer reported during the 1:00 p.m. Eastern hour of MSNBC Live that police were looking for “two suspects, apparently wearing Make America Great Again hats, though that has not yet been officially confirmed.”

Since Smollett was exposed, the usual media suspects have twisted the news item into a “conservatives pounce” story. Meanwhile, right-leaning news outlets have endeavored to explain why the media seem to continuously fall for hate crime hoaxes. In a National Review piece, Andy Ngo blamed the rise of “victimhood culture,” which he termed “America’s sickness.” Others, such as PJ Media’s Debra Heine, theorized that culpable journalists might suffer from some combination of confirmation bias and plain old gullibility.

As with the Covington scandal – not to mention moments like this one on CNN – the Smollett coverage is further evidence that Trump supporters have become fair game in the liberal media’s rule book.

Recent polling suggests that the media establishment is suffering from a credibility crisis. Journalists like Mumford are right to be concerned; but concern alone will not rehabilitate them in the eyes of the same Americans whom they tarred — inadvertently or otherwise — with their reckless handling of the Smollett story."

""I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened, and the guilty should suffer the maximum,"" Sharpton said Sunday on his MSNBC program ""Politics Nation.""

""I still maintain that,"" he added. ""And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.""

On January 29, Smollett was allegedly beaten by two assailants in a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago, Illinois.

According to Smollett, who stars as Jamal Lyon on Fox's ""Empire,"" two perpetrators, who were wearing ski masks, yelled, ""Aren't you that f****t 'Empire' n*****?"" before attacking him, Sputnik previously reported.

They also yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" before walking away from the scene of the crime. MAGA is shorthand for US President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

However, on Saturday, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the case told CNN that they believe Smollett paid two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo (who were ""Empire"" extras) to stage the assault against him. According to the brothers, who were arrested and questioned by the Chicago Police Department last week, Smollett decided to stage the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter he had previously received did not generate enough attention, a Chicago Police Department official told ABC News Monday.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America's"" Robin Roberts last week, Smollett discussed the letter.

""Just because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said, 'Smollett, Jussie, you will die, black [expletive],'"" Smollett said. ""There was no address, but the return address said in big, red, you know, like caps, 'MAGA.' Did I make that up too?""

The Osundairo brothers were released on Friday, as officials noted the discovery of ""new evidence.""

In addition, Chicago police are investigating a tip that Smollett and the two brothers were seen in his apartment building elevator together the same night that Smollett reported being attacked.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement this weekend. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview."""

In case you somehow missed the story, here's a brief recap:

Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two white men while walking home from a Subway restaurant around 2 am.

Despite frigid, polar vortex weather, Smollett stated that the two men had staked him out and recognized him from his role on TV's Empire.

He added that they came equipped with a bottle of bleach that they dumped over his head and a length of clothesline that they wrapped around his neck in an act mock lynching.

Smollett claimed that the men used several racist and homophobic slurs and screamed at him, ""This is MAGA country!""

Many found the actor's version of events suspicious from the start, but Smollett quickly gained the support of numerous celebrities and politicians, including presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

Over the course of the past week, however, Smollett's story began to unravel.

Currently, Chicago police are investigating the possibility that Smollett staged the attack with the help of two Nigerian who briefly worked as extras on Empire.

His case is set to go before a grand jury as early this week.

If convicted of a felony for filing a false police report, Smollett faces several years behind bars.

So it should come as no surprise that he's lawyering up -- or that he's reportedly hired one of the most famous defense attorneys in the country.

According to TMZ, Smollett has hired Mark Geragos to represent him in court.

Neither Smollett nor Geragos has officially announced that decision, but the attorney has spoken out on Jussie's behalf on several occasions, most recently on Anderson Cooper's CNN show:

""Any time you start to get law enforcement drip, drip, drip leaks that, to me, is a telltale sign that something else is going on,"" Geragos told the host.

Geragos went on to express his doubts that it would have been possible for police to track down Smollett's alleged co-conspirators via the ""grainy footage"" that was presented to them.

He credits Smollett's cooperation with the arrest of the brothers, and states -- in somewhat contradictory fashion -- that they were only taken into custody due to public ""pressure"" to make an arrest.

""I haven't seen anything but leaks from law enforcement sources,"" Geragos added.

""To me, that screams out that someone is trying to manipulate something.""

No doubt by this time, many on both sides of the aisle would prefer for this ugly story to disappear from the headlines.

But as Geragos and Smollett gear up for an epic legal battle, we're reminded that this saga is just getting started."

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

ORIGINAL STORY:

On Tuesday, the Associated Press confirmed that the Chicago Police Department is investigating a credible tip from a witness who claims he saw “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett in an elevator on January 29 together with the two Nigerian brothers he allegedly paid to help him stage a hate crime attack.

The AP reported: “Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.”

“[The Chicago Police Department] confirm [Associated Press] report they’re investigating a tip that on the night #JussieSmollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers. [Chicago Police] are interviewing a witness who says he saw them all together,” reported Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel.

According to a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, the witness, who “lives in the building or was visiting someone there,” told police he saw Smollett and the two brothers on the night of January 29, the date the attack allegedly took place, reports the AP.

Authorities are currently investigating the tip and plan to interview the alleged witness on Tuesday, according to Mr. Guglielmi.

Smollett claims he was targeted by two white Trump supporters at 2:30 a.m. on his way home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago because he’s black and gay. The men allegedly called Smollett a “n*****” and a “f*****” and told him he was in “MAGA country.” The actor also says the men kicked him in the ribs, tied a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him.

However, new reports suggest Smollett hired the two Nigerian men, who have since been arrested in connection to the case, to stage the attack on him after a threatening “MAGA” letter he received at work did not generate enough media attention.

The letter Smollett received, which can be seen below, says “you will die black f**” in cutout magazines letters. It also contained a white powder later identified as Tylenol and the acronym “MAGA” written under the return address.

According to reporting from Weigel, the Chicago Police Department found in the brothers’ home: “bleach, a red hat, a receipt (PD says was for the rope) and a magazine that according to our source ‘was similar’ to the one used in the letter that was sent to #Smollett.”"

It makes for the second HBO advertisement in Los Angeles, California, that the Faction has vandalized since the start of 2019, part of a campaign to fight “Trump Derangement Syndrome” in the media.

In mid-January, media outlet Culttture ran exclusive footage of the Faction targeting a billboard advertisement for liberal comedian Bill Maher’s Real Time talk show with the same meme.

This week, elsewhere in the city, a fellow conservative street artist who goes by the name Sabo trolled Hollywood by posting faux movie posters.

Harris, a progressive Democratic presidential candidate who has embraced Medicare for all, told NBC that rising costs are making health care unaffordable. She said she wants to provide universal access to health care.

""It’s about understanding that access to affordable health care should not be a privilege, it should be a right. It’s about understanding that in a democracy, and the way we have constructed our democracy, we at least in concept have said that your access to public education, public health or public safety should not be a function of how much money you have,” Harris said.

A Harris adviser later signaled that she would be open to more moderate plans to reform health care.

Medicare for all has become a sort of progressive litmus test among 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, and is a marker of where many Democrats are pushing for their party and the country to go.

In Congress, the party is wrestling over a variety of proposals, and Harris herself has co-sponsored various Medicare for all-type bills, including a Medicare buy-in."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

This version of the story corrects the 4th paragraph to say that last week police said reports the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed. Corrects earlier version saying that police had declined to comment on whether it was a hoax.

And he was right. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" Joe Biden warned that ""we must no longer give this hate safe harbor,"" his implication being that we need to stop winking at such racist attacks. If Beale Street Could Talk's Barry Jenkins lamented, ""This what all that hateful mongering has wrought. Are you PROUD???"" Good Morning America interviewed Smollett without asking a single critical question about his story.The examples are as numerous as the retractions will be minimal.Yet the CPD, along with their law enforcement brethren, are surely aware of what the data say regarding hate crimes. In 2017, the FBI reported an additional 1,000 hate crimes from 2016, for a total of 7,000. But an additional 1,000 police agencies participated in hate-crime reporting in 2017, as Reason's Robby Soave has pointed out, so it's not clear that that increase is real or simply a result of more reporting.And the definition of a hate crime is highly political: very little black-on-white street crime gets classified as such, though hatred for whites undoubtedly drives a considerable fraction of this activity. (Between 2012 and 2015, blacks committed more than 85 percent of interracial violent victimizations between blacks and whites.)Native American activist Nathan Phillips concocted an outright lie about his interaction with the Covington Catholic High School students, and he, too, became an instant, revered celebrity. Then as now, public figure after public figure announced that MAGA hats were the very symbol of white supremacy. Alyssa Milano declared that ""the MAGA hat is the new white hood."" New York Times columnist Charles Blow called MAGA hats the ""new iconography of white supremacy."" Other recent credulously received phony claims of white racism include the Jazmine Barnes case in Houston and racial-profiling charges against a South Carolina cop. Andy Ngo has collected many more. Now that Smollett's story is falling apart, he is clinging to his victim identity any way he can: his lawyers say that he feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault.. Anti-racism-preferably of a performative nature-is now the national religion of white elites, who would rather blame themselves (and the deplorables) for nonexistent racism than speak honestly about the behavioral problems and academic skills gaps that lead to ongoing socioeconomic disparities. The Senate just passed an anti-lynching bill, backed by Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott-as if lynchings were a fact of our current reality. Don't be surprised if Democrats appropriate funding for a new underground railroad.The current anti-racist frenzy is the product of a poisoned academic culture that has declared war on Western Civilization and that teaches students, more than anything else, how to hate-to hate the greatest accomplishments of our civilization, to hate America, and to hate one another.We continue to play with fire."

The Reverend Al Sharpton believes Jussie Smollett should be held accountable ‘to the maximum’ if it is found that the Empire actor staged a homophobic and racist attack on himself.

Sharpton was addressing the incident on Sunday after Chicago police said they were still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that ‘shifted’ their investigation of the reported attack.

It shifted after police questioned two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, following allegations Smollett paid them $3,500 to assault him in an orchestrated, rehearsed attack.

Sharpton, a civil rights leaders, said the alleged attack on Smollett was a ‘reminder of the times we live in’ when it was first reported on January 30.

The Democratic reverend doubled down on his rebuke of it on Sunday.

‘I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,’ Sharpton said on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation.

‘I still maintain that. And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.

He added, however, the it was not a ‘left wing hoax’ like some had claimed on social media because even President Trump had condemned the incident.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ‘This is MAGA country!’

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Smollett said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Reports emerged last week that the actor may have staged the attack to save his job on Empire with the help of the two brothers who he supposedly knew as extras on the show.

The pair decided to cooperate with police after investigators revealed that they had evidence the brothers bought the rope that was put around Smollet’s neck at the nearby at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store hardware store.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ‘victimized’ by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that: ‘Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ‘suspects’ in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

‘It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,’ the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim.

Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

One of those people supporting Smollett was House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who wrote on the day of the attack: ‘The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.’

She has since deleted her tweet."

Smollett’s alleged fake “hate crime” appears to be the latest instance of liberals manufacturing hate crimes for attention in the Trump era.

The Daily Caller News Foundation compiled below some of the most outrageous fake hate crimes since Trump was elected, in rough chronological order:

1. Anti-Muslim hate crime in Michigan turns out to be a hoax (November 2016)

A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention from national outlets like The Washington Post in November 2016 after she claimed a drunk 20-something man threatened to light her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax.

2. Bisexual student fakes Trump-inspired hate crime (November 2016)

Taylor Volk, an openly bisexual senior at North Park University, claimed to be the target of hateful notes and emails following Trump’s election in November 2016. Volk told NBC News that “I just want them to stop.” But the “them” referenced by Volk turned out to be herself, as the whole thing was fabricated.

3. Gas station racism goes viral—then police debunk it (November 2016)

Philadelphia woman Ashley Boyer claimed in November 2016 that she was harassed at a gas station by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. Boyer claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.” Boyer deleted her post after it went viral and claimed the men had been caught and were facing criminal charges. Local police debunked her account.

4. White men rob Muslim woman of her hijab and wallet–except it never happened (November 2016)

An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed in November 2016 that two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

5. Church organist vandalizes own church (November 2016)

A church organist was arrested in May 2017 after he was found responsible for spray-painting a swastika, an anti-gay slur, and the words “Heil Trump” on his own church in November 2016. When the story first broke, media outlets tied the hoax to Trump’s election. “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” The Washington Post reported at the time.

6. “Drunk white men” attack Muslim woman in story that also never happened (December 2016)

Another 18-year-old Muslim woman, this time in New York, was the subject of breathless headlines in December 2016 after she claimed to have been attacked by a group of Trump supporters on a New York subway while onlookers did nothing. The woman, Yasmin Seweid, would go on to confess that she made the whole thing up.

7. White guy sets his own car on fire, paints racial slur on his own garage (December 2016)

Denton, Texas, resident David Williams set his own car on fire and painted “n—— lovers” on his home’s garage, in an apparent attempt to stage a hate crime. Local police investigated the arson as a hate crime. Williams and his wife, Jenny, collected more than $5,000 from Good Samaritans via a GoFundMe page before the hoax was exposed.

8. Prankster tricks liberal journalist into spreading anti-Trump hoax (December 2016)

As tales of Trump-inspired “hate crimes” were spread far and wide by liberal journalists after Trump’s election, one online prankster decided to test just easy it was to fool journalists. The prankster sent Mic.com writer Sarah Harvard a fictitious story in which a Native American claimed to have been harassed by an alleged Trump supporter who thought she was Mexican. Despite no evidence backing up the claim, Harvard spread the fake story, emails the prankster shared with The Daily Caller showed.

9. Student writes anti-Muslim graffiti on his own door (February 2017)

A Muslim student at Beloit College wrote anti-Muslim graffiti on his own dorm room door. The student was reportedly motivated by a desire to seek attention after a Jewish student was targeted with an anti-Semitic note.

10. Israeli man behind anti-Semitic bomb threats in the U.S. (April 2017)

Media outlets didn’t wait to find out who was behind a string of bomb threats targeting synagogues and Jewish schools before linking the threats to Trump. A U.S.-Israeli man was charged in April 2017 and indicted in February 2018 for the threats. A former reporter for The Intercept was also charged in March 2017 with making several copycat threats.

11. Hoax at St. Olaf College (May 2017)

Students at St. Olaf College in Minnesota staged protests and boycotted classes in May 2017 after racist notes targeting black students were found around campus, earning coverage in national media outlets like The Washington Post. It later came out that a black student was responsible for the racist notes. The student carried out the hoax in order to “draw attention to concerns about the campus climate,” the university announced.

12. Fake hate at Air Force Academy goes viral (September 2017)

The Air Force Academy was thrown into turmoil in September 2017 when horrific racist notes were found at the academy’s preparatory school. “Go home n—er,” read one of the notes. The superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, went viral with an impassioned speech addressing the racist notes.

“If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect–then you need to get out.”-Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, Superintendent @AF_Academy pic.twitter.com/njCktv5Fmp — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) September 28, 2017

Two months later, authorities determined that one of the students targeted by the notes was also the person responsible for writing them.

13. Kansas State fake hate crime (November 2017)

A student at Kansas State University filed a police report in November 2017 over racist graffiti left on his car. “Go Home N—— Boy” and “Whites Only,” read the racist graffiti, which the the student later admitted to writing himself.

14. Racist graffiti carried out by nonwhite student (November 2017)

Another instance of racist graffiti that same month also turned out to be a hoax. A Missouri high school investigated after racial slurs were left on a bathroom mirror in November 2017, only to find that the student responsible was “nonwhite.”

15. Waiter fakes note calling himself a terrorist (July 2018)

Texas waiter Khalil Cavil went viral after posting a Facebook picture of a racist note that he claimed a customer had left on the receipt, in lieu of a tip. The note described Cavil as a “terrorist.” Saltgrass Steak House, where Cavil worked, initially banned the customers for life, before their investigation revealed that the waiter had faked the racist note. “I did write it,” Cavil later admitted. “I don’t have an explanation. I made a mistake. There is no excuse for what I did.”

16. Waitress fakes racist note, blames law enforcement (July 2018)

A Texas waitress apologized in July 2018 after blaming local law enforcement for an offensive note targeting Mexicans. She later admitted to writing the note herself.

17. New York woman’s hate crime that wasn’t (September 2018)

A New York woman was charged in September 2018 after police determined she fabricated a story about white teens yelling racial slurs at her and leaving a racist note on her car.

18. Student faked racist notes (December 2018)

Several racist notes at Drake University were actually the work of one of the students who had been targeted by them. “The fact that the actions of the student who has admitted guilt were propelled by motives other than hate does not minimize the worry and emotional harm they caused, but should temper fears,” Drake University President Marty Martin said afterward.

19. The Covington catastrophe (January 2019)

National media outlets pounced on a selectively edited video from the March for Life that showed Native American activist Nathan Phillips beating a drum in front of a boisterous group of boys from Covington Catholic High School.

Phillips originally told The Washington Post the students swarmed him while he was preparing to leave the Indigenous People’s March scheduled for the same day. Phillips originally said one student, who later identified himself as high school junior Nick Sandmann, blocked his path from leaving as he tried to do so.

The extended video shows that wasn’t the case: Phillips approached the high school boys during their cheers, not the other way around. Some of the people with Phillips were directing racially charged language at the students, not the other way around.

Phillips told a second variation of his story to the Detroit Free Press. Phillips claimed he was playing the role of peacemaker by getting between the students and four “old black individuals,” whom he claimed the students were attacking.

“They were in the process of attacking these four black individuals,” Phillips told the Michigan paper. “I was there and I was witnessing all of this … As this kept on going on and escalating, it just got to a point where you do something or you walk away, you know? You see something that is wrong and you’re faced with that choice of right or wrong.”

“These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey, and I stood in between them and so they needed their pounds of flesh and they were looking at me for that,” he added.

Extended video shows that account also isn’t accurate. The four individuals Phillips referenced were members of the Black Hebrew Israelites and they launched racist and anti-gay slurs at the high school students, not the other way around.

Bonus: Anti-Semitic vandal exposed as Democratic activist (November 2018)

Anti-Semitic vandalism in New York City turned out to be the work of a Democratic activist, according to police. It wasn’t a hoax—the anti-Semitic vandalism was real—but the suspect wasn’t the right-winger some had assumed him to be. The man police arrested, based on surveillance footage, was 26-year-old James Polite, who had actually interned for City Hall on anti-hate issues.

Bonus II: Trump-inspired racist blaze at black church was carried out by black churchgoer (November 2016)



This hoax occurred one week before Trump was elected, but The Daily Caller News Foundation is including it as a bonus because it was so egregious. Leftist media outlets ran headlines like “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump” after a black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and spray painted with the words “Vote Trump.”

The Washington Post’s original coverage of the incident read in part, “Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons called the fire a ‘hateful and cowardly act,’ sparked by the incendiary rhetoric of GOP nominee Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.” But the church was set on fire by one of the church’s own congregants, who is black.

The 36-year-old star of Fox TV drama Empire told police on Jan 29 that two masked men beat him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck on the streets of downtown Chicago.

Public figures including Emma Watson, Katy Perry, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden led an outpouring of sympathy for Smollett, with Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker decrying ""an attempted modern-day lynching"".

President Donald Trump commented that the alleged attack was ""horrible"".

Now police say they want to speak to the actor again after two ""potential suspects"" were released without charge, with US media outlets reporting that the attack may have been staged.

Smollett, who has hired a prominent criminal defence attorney, said his assailants used racial and homophobic slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" - a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But Chicago TV station WBBM reported that the suspects claimed Smollett hired them to stage the attack because he was unhappy that a threatening letter he had earlier received had not got enough attention.

Chicago Police spokesman Jessica Rocco told AFP detectives had received a tip that the suspects were seen with Smollett in the lift of his apartment building on the night of the incident.

Police are working to confirm the tip, said Rocco, who would not reveal whether there was video evidence.

""We do not have any further details at this time,"" Rocco told AFP.

The suspects were identified as brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, who had ties to Smollett, according to US media.

The probe could be handed to a grand jury this week, according to the celebrity news website TMZ, which reported on Tuesday that the actor's role on Empire has been curtailed.

Fox declined to comment."

“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”

The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.

Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.

If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.

“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”

Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.

Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.

Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. Update: NBC News reported Tuesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanor counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the L.A. City Attorney’s office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.

Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.

“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.”

Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.

“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”

Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.

“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.

Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.

“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”

Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.

“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.”"

Jussie Smollett was allegedly seen with Abel and Ola Osundairo on the night of his Chicago attack, according to a tip received by the Chicago Police Department.

On Tuesday, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Associated Press that authorities are investigating information given to them by a person who either lives in the Empire star’s apartment building, or was visiting someone there.

Allegedly, the individual saw the actor and the Nigerian brothers in an elevator on the night in question.

Per CBS 2 on Monday, a source told investigator Brad Edwards that the thespian “concocted the staged attack” after a racist and homophobic letter addressed to him “didn’t get enough attention.” According to insiders via CNN, the Osundairos were allegedly paid by the star to orchestrate the attack, which TMZ said was allegedly rehearsed days prior.

Despite the controversy, two of Smollett’s siblings — Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett — are standing by their brother.

On Monday, Jurnee reposted Jocqui’s Instagram image of a quote attributed to Malcolm X that seemingly blames the media for incorrectly spinning Jussie’s story.

Jocqui also reposted a screenshot of a tweet that says even if there was concrete evidence in support of Jussie, detractors would still discredit the 36-year-old because of their “contempt for survivors of hate crimes.”

Though their investigation has “shifted,” the Chicago PD have not officially declared Smollett a suspect. They also have not identified him as a victim or person of interest.

Last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for about 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

On Tuesday November 27th thousands of Mississippians will vote for a senator. We need someone who respects lives of lynch victims.



We're hanging nooses to remind people that times haven't changed.



FBI statistics for 2015 (the most recent available at the time of the 2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Hate Crimes Hearing ) show that there were 1,997,700 violent crimes in the U.S. A total of 5,850 crimes were designated hate crimes – whether violent or non-violent. There were 15,696 cases of murder or manslaughter in the U.S., of which 8, or .0005, were designated hate crimes. There were 764,449 aggravated assaults, of which 681, or .00089, were designated hate crimes. There were 124,047 rapes, of which 12, or .000096, were designated hate crimes. There were 327,374 robberies, of which 120, or .00036, were designated hate crimes.



By Bryan Fischer Follow me on Twitter: @BryanJFischer , on Facebook at ""Focal Point""Host of ""Focal Point"" on American Family Radio, 1:05 pm CT, M-F www.afr.net For the last number of years, our nation has been awash in ""hate crimes"" against minorities, gays, and transgendered folk.Or have we?The national media went into an instant froth in early February when actor Jussie Smollett, of the TV show ""Empire,"" claimed to have been beaten by two white guys wearing ""MAGA"" hats and yelling that Chicago is ""MAGA country,"" an assertion that is about as far from the truth as it is possible to get. Smollett was able to tick two boxes on his victim card as both a black and a homosexual. National race-baiters jumped into battle before the first pixels of the story had faded. President candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker (of ""Spartacus"" fame) were quick to call it a ""lynching,"" and the rhetoric heated up from there. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it "" an affront to our humanity ."" Socialist poster child Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blistered the media for describing the incident as a ""possible"" hate crime. Her anti-American, pro-Palestinian colleague Rashida Tlaib wrote hysterically that "" the right wing is killing and hurting our people .""Now, however, Smollett has turned from a victim into a perp. Chicago police are now saying the attack was staged by the actor with the help of two acquaintances of his from Nigeria who took five grand from Smollett for their part in the hoax. Celebrities from coast-to-coast are back-pedaling as fast as they can to get away from the mess altogether. Even Nancy Pelosi deleted her nasty Tweet.Last November, In Mississippi, an apparently horrid hate crime involving nooses turned out to be nothing of the sort. In fact, the ""perpetrators"" were not racists but anti-racists. The nooses were not an expression of racism, but a protest against racism.The nooses in question were hung in the Mississippi state capitol building the day before the election last November. Cindy-Hyde Smith, the Republican candidate and eventual winner, had made a lame joke about hanging that was clearly made in reference to the fate of horse thieves in the Old West.The nooses had been found along with what the media called ""hate signs,"" which was a narrative that worked until the Mississippi Department of Public Safety released photos of the ""hate signs."" Here's what they said:Oops. The message of the nooses was not targeted at blacks but at supposedly racist whites. The media slowly and reluctantly corrected their inflammatory headlines.Also in Mississippi, just a week before the 2018 election that sent Donald Trump to the White House, a historic black church was burned and spray-painted with the message ""Vote Trump."" It was immediately labeled a ""hate crime,"" and remained so until authorities discovered that the culprit was actually a member of the congregation. After the fire, while their church was being renovated, the congregation worshiped at a predominantly white church, a sign of the progress in race relations in the Deep South.I am the co-author of Idaho's marriage amendment, passed 63-37 in 2006 to enshrine man-woman marriage in our state constitution. The homosexual lobby spent a good part of the campaign insisting that the amendment would unleash a wave of hate and violence targeted at gays in Idaho.Sure enough, the day after the election, a twenty-something man filed a police report that he had been jumped while walking on our city's greenbelt by attackers yelling anti-gay slurs and swinging their fists. Ah, said the activists, there is your proof – we told you this would happen!However, it didn't take long for his story to unravel when he was questioned by police, and it turned out that he beat himself up because apparently there were no gay-haters in Boise willing to do it for him.Andy Ngo is a journalist, editor (at Quillette), and photographer who started a thread on Twitter two days ago rehearsing the litany of fake hate crimes over the last several years. (I'd show you but I have been suspended – again- by Twitter for telling the truth about sexual deviancy.)Here is his giant list of fake hate crimes , just during the Trump administration. In my judgment, we should simply abolish the ""hate crime"" designation altogether. Every crime is a hate crime, and we should not give more legal protections to victims of some crimes than we give to victims of other crimes. Justice indeed should be blind to color.Peter Kirsanow, a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, points out that the facts contradict the media narrative that hate crimes are on rapid and disturbing rise:In 2017, nearly 90 percent of reporting police departments registeredhate crimes in their respective jurisdictions. And the most recent data show that blacks are much more likely to commit hate crimes than whites. In fact, blacks are approximately 200 percent more likely to commit hate crimes than whites.At a Commission hearing on hate crimes, Kirsanow asked this question of the panel of criminologists, law-enforcement officials, and hate-crime experts:federalNo one answered. Kirsanow poses this question to us: ""If designating a crime a hate crime doesn't deter, prevent, or resolve such crime, what's the purpose of the designation? By now, most Americans are getting a pretty good idea.""In other words, ""hate crimes"" are not about justice at all. They're about giving regressives a cudgel to beat conservatives about the head and shoulders until everybody figures out the crimes are fabrications.Here's a point worth pondering. If hate crimes are so rare they have to be invented, perhaps America is not nearly as racist and homophobic as the Talking Snake Media wants us to believe. And maybe, just maybe, the hate and racism is coming from the left rather than the right.© Bryan Fischer"

The recusal by Cook County prosecutor Kim Foxx is the most recent twist in an increasingly bizarre case that stems from Smollett, a black and gay actor known for his role in the TV series “Empire,” alleging that he was brutally attacked on a street in Chicago around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29.

Chicago police initially said this week that they were looking into a tip that claimed Smollett was seen riding the elevator in his apartment building the night of the attack with the two men arrested (and then released) as his suspected assailants. But officers later said the tip was unfounded.

The developments in the case come amid mounting suspicion — much of which has been fueled by media reports citing unnamed police sources — that Smollett paid his alleged assailants to stage the attack. The FBI and United Postal Service are also reportedly looking into allegations that Smollett sent a threatening letter containing crushed up Advil to himself.

Smollett, 36, said he was out getting something to eat at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, when two masked men hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, beat him up, shouted “MAGA Country,” threw a chemical substance on him, and placed a noose around his neck. Smollett returned to his apartment after the attack and then called the police, who took his report and suggested he take himself to hospital for evaluation.

Days later, Smollett appeared on stage for a sold-out concert in Los Angeles with no visible injuries apart from a small mark under one eye. “I had to be here tonight,” he told his fans.

The brutal nature of the allegations against a backdrop of rising hate crimes nationwide thrust the case into the national spotlight and generated an outpouring of support from prominent lawmakers, including 2020 contenders Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and former Vice President Joe Biden. (Harris and Booker have declined to comment further on the case pending the outcome of the investigation).

But in the days immediately following the alleged attack, Chicago Police said they were struggling to locate evidence that could help them identify Smollett’s assailants, which only fueled speculation — mostly from the right — that the whole situation could be a hoax. Even Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, jumped in and retweeted posts promoting the theory that Smollett had faked his own attack.

Weeks later, the skepticism has now started moving across party lines. Cardi B said on Instagram Live Monday that she was “really disappointed” in him. “I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro,” Cardi said.

For his part, Smollett has vehemently denied any suggestion that he was complicit in his own attack. “Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” his lawyer said.

Police sources told NBC News that, if Smollett was found to be lying, he could face criminal charges and possibly even jail time. Falsification of police reports in Illinois is a Class 4 felony and carries a prison sentence of one to three years.

The arrests

On Jan. 31, after scouring “hundreds of hours of surveillance video,” Chicago police published a grainy image taken from an overhead camera showing “persons of interest,” two individuals in the approximate place and time where Smollett said he was attacked.

Nearly two weeks later, on Feb. 13, police took two brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, into custody after they arrived at Chicago O’Hare airport. According to CBS News, the brothers had left for Nigeria the day after the alleged attack. Police had also raided their home in Chicago and removed bleach, a red hat, black masks, and an “Empire” script, among other items that lined up with Smollett’s accusations.

In an emotional appearance on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" on Feb. 14, Smollett discussed the alleged attack and said he believed he’d been targeted because of his outspoken criticism of the Trump administration.

Later that day, citing “sources familiar with the investigation,” ABC-7 and CBS Chicago reported that Chicago Police were looking into whether the two men they’d taken into custody had colluded with Smollett to stage the attack. Their motive for staging the attack, sources told ABC-7, was because Smollett was being written off ""Empire."" (Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment released a statement saying the idea that Smollett would be written off the show was “patently ridiculous.”)

Ongoing investigation

In response, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote in a statement on Twitter that such reports describing the attack as a “hoax” were unconfirmed by case detectives. “We have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate” he tweeted.

But on Friday, Feb. 15, the Osundairo brothers were released without charges “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations,” Guglielmi wrote on Twitter.

The next day, Smollett’s lawyer released a statement denying his client’s complicity in the attack and said one of the brothers was “Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.” He added that it was “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie.”

That same day, CBS reported — once again citing unnamed police sources — that the Osundairo brothers told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack and fessed up after detectives confronted them with evidence linking them to the rope that was tied around the actor's neck in a noose.

CBS also reported, via anonymous sources, that Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 before they left for Nigeria on Jan. 29 and promised them $500 more upon their return. CNN, also citing unnamed police sources, reported that Smollett paid the brothers to “orchestrate the assault.”

In a statement that evening, Chicago police said that information they learned from the Osundairo brothers during questioning had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” adding that they’d reached out to Smollett’s lawyer to request a follow-up interview.

On Monday Feb. 19, Smollett’s lawyer released a statement that any reports of his client planning to meet with police for a second interview that day were false.

By that point, conservative media and pundits that had labeled the case a hoax from the beginning were claiming victory. Donald Trump Jr. shared an article on Twitter by the Daily Wire, a conservative publication, with the headline “The Jussie Smollett Hoax Is What Happens When A Culture Fetishizes Victimhood.”

The next day, according to the Associated Press, Chicago police were following up on a tip from someone who lives in Smollett’s apartment building that they saw him riding the elevator with the Osundairo brothers the same day of the attack. Police later found out the tip didn’t square with video surveillance footage taken from the building.

CBS Chicago, again citing unnamed police sources, reported Tuesday that Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter sent to Fox Studios and addressed to him last month “didn’t get enough attention.” CBS also reported that Chicago police are no longer referring to Smollett as a “victim,” and now refer to him as “the individual who reported the incident.”

And according to Deadline, Fox is taking steps to minimize Smollett’s role in ""Empire"" and cutting some of his scenes, in response to the controversy.

The Chicago Police did not respond to VICE News' request for comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue co-operating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

City Attorney's office confirmed to NBC News.

Smollett, now 36, was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail in the 2007 case, an L.A. City Attorney's spokesman told NBC News.

The case is coming to light as Chicago police investigate whether Smollett made up a story about being the victim of a racially, motivated hate crime. Chicago police have requested LAPD provide them information about the 2007 arrest, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar the investigation.

Chicago police officials say they have shifted their focus from a hate crime investigation to one of filing a false report.

At this point Chicago police have said Smollett is neither considered a victim nor a suspect and are waiting to hear from him.

Police sources tell NBC News that the LAPD made the initial arrest. The case was handled by prosecutors with the LA City Attorney's office in the Van Nuys branch.

On Tuesday Chicago police were investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven't confirmed the person's account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday."

The brothers were also seen in a ride-share near the location of the attack in the Streeterville neighborhood. They arrived before Smollett and were seen sitting on a bench and walking around.

The two people seen in a still image swiped from surveillance footage in the area and circulated widely on suspicion of being the attackers were later confirmed by the police to be the brothers.

Sources said that a passing car gave the brothers pause about going through with the plan but they ultimately did.

Police confirmed that they received the tip about the trio being together on an elevator.

It wasn’t clear whether the witness saw the trio before or after the alleged attack, a police spokesman told the Wall Street Journal.

The witness is believed to either live in the same apartment building or was visiting when he saw Smollett and the brothers together, reported the Chicago Sun-Times. A police spokesman stressed that the validity of the information hasn’t been confirmed as of yet.

A law enforcement source told the Sun-Times on Tuesday that a grand jury could be empaneled soon to investigate Smollett’s claims in the wake of explosive information that seemed to shift the investigation from an alleged hate crime to an alleged hoax, as law enforcement sources told a number of news agencies that the Nigerian brothers told detectives that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack and even rehearsed how it should go down with them several days before Jan. 29.

TMZ previously reported that a grand jury would be put in place soon, as early as Tuesday.

Amid the reports, Smollett has maintained his innocence. In an interview published by ABC News, he blasted people who expressed doubt at his attack, details of which almost immediately prompted speculation, such as two supporters of President Donald Trump not only being in Chicago but recognizing Smollett from a television show.

While acknowledging that he knows the brothers, and saying he hired one as a personal trainer, the actor denied their reported account and said he was not involved in planning the alleged attack. His attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a statement on Saturday that the actor was upset and “victimized” by reports.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” they said.

Over the weekend, police confirmed that the Osundairos were arrested on suspicion of attacking Smollett but were later released after speaking with detectives. The information “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” one police spokesman said, saying police were looking to speak with Smollett to try to verify the information.

On Monday, Smollett’s team said he wouldn’t be going to the police to speak with them and officials said they hadn’t heard from the actor’s representatives in terms of setting up an interview.

A police spokesman told Fox reporter Rafer Weigel on Monday that there were no plans to impanel a grand jury but that it could be a last resort if Smollett didn’t submit to an interview voluntarily.

On Tuesday, CBS Chicago reported that Smollett might be hiring a new lawyer. “His team is talking with famed Los Angeles defense attorney Mark Geragos, whose represented Michael Jackson, Scott Peterson, Chris Brown, and on,” reported CBS reporter Brad Edwards.

“It’s not a done deal. Jussie’s wavered on counsel, but I’m told could be this close.”"

On Tuesday (Feb. 19), Chicago police confirmed they received a new tip in the ongoing investigation on the attack of Jussie Smollett. The Chicago Sun-Times reported police indicated Smollett may have been spotted in his building’s elevator with the two alleged attackers, brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo. Authorities have now told reporters that the tip is “unfounded.”

See the original story below.

Chicago police now believe the actor staged his own attack.

Chicago police are following up on a tip that Jussie Smollett was seen in an elevator with the two men previously arrested in connection with the attack that happened against the actor last month.

READ: Report: Chicago Police Claim Jussie Smollett Staged His Own Attack

According to a report from the Chicago Sun-Times, the tipster — presumed to be a resident or visitor in Smollett’s apartment building — said they saw the three men together the same night that the actor reported being attacked. The validity of the tip has yet to be confirmed, with investigators planning on interviewing the person Tuesday.

Police had previously disputed that the attack against Smollett was a hoax but now believe he staged it after speaking with two brothers that claim Smollett hired them for the attack.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were brought in on Wednesday as the lead suspects in the incident. After a round of interviewing and the threat of being charged with battery, the Osundairo brothers claimed that Smollet hired them to participate in the staged attack, paying them $4,000 for their assistance. They went on to paint a drastically differed picture of the incident, claiming to have bought the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a local hardware store and the red imitation MAGA hats at a beauty supply. They even rehearsed the attack a few days prior.

As a result of the scandal, his role in Empire as Jamal Lyon has reportedly been reduced.

Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to last episode but five of those scenes, as well as the musical number, have been cut. The episode is currently being shot.

The report continues: “As for the remaining 4 scenes…we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.”

According to TMZ, Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was suppose to appear in nine upcoming scenes, along with a big musical number in the second to last episode, which is currently being shot. However, his scenes have been reduced to four—where he will not longer be the main focus of—and the musical number is gone completely.

As a result, Smollett will only be working one or two days this week instead of every day like before.

As for the writers, they've been working in overtime making edits and multiple revisions to work around the scenario.

The actor's case will now head to a grand jury with a focus of presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against him.

Last month, Smollett claimed two masked men attacked him with racial and homophobic slurs, beat him, poured an unknown substance on him that may have been bleach, then proceeded to tie a rope around his neck. A week later, the actor spoke out about the riveted experience. Not long after that, law enforcement told news outlets that Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to carry out the attack. The brothers reportedly admitted they rehearsed the situation ""days"" before it happened and bought the rope to tie around Smollett's neck.

The Chicago Police Department has requested an interview with Smollett, but the actor has since declined.

As the story develops, the Chicago P.D. is reportedly investigating a tip that the Empire star was inside an elevator with the men who attacked him just before making the 911 call. A spokesperson for the department said a person who either lives in the apartment building or visiting someone there reportedly witnessed Smollett and the two brothers together.

Smollett's legal team insists on denying all claims that announce him as anything other than the victim.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement.

Several of his fellow cast members from the Fox series were quick to make statements defending their friend after initial reports of the attack came out.

Whether he'll be written off the show is still up in the air but the show's cocreator announced a week ago that their intentions are to keep him.

""There is 0 percent truth that [Smollett] was going to be written off of Empire,"" Danny Strong announced in a tweet. ""This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed."""

According to ABC News, FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service officials are probing the matter after two Nigerian brothers said to have helped stage the attack accused Smollett of playing a role in sending the letter. Further, ABC News reports that the letter, mailed to the studio on January 22, is undergoing an FBI crime lab analysis.

Cops: Smollett Faked Attack After No Fuss Over Bigoted Letter https://t.co/Tbj9NMDvyJ pic.twitter.com/dLKMevPpl2 — RCInvestigations (@RCInvestigates) February 19, 2019

The development follows reports that Smollett “concocted” the “staged” assault after the letter failed to garner a “bigger reaction.”

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2’s Brad Edwards.

The letter reportedly contained a message which read “Die Black fag” and “white powder,” which was later determined to be crushed aspirin.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to CNN that a HAZMAT team scrambled to Cinespace Studios, where the program was being shot, upon the letter’s discovery.

Chicago police are seeking to re-question Smollett amid reports that he “orchestrated” the attack with Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, who were extras on Empire. “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Anna Kavanagh, a press representative for Smollett, said in a statement. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Smollett, who is gay and African-American, told police that two masked individuals doused him with an unknown chemical substance as they hurled racist and anti-gay insults on January 29. The actor also told police that his assailants looped a thin rope around his neck and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before darting off.

In a statement to ABC News, Smollett’s lawyers said their client was “angered” and “further victimized” by reports that planned the alleged assault.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” they continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

The statement came after CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported that at least one of the brothers bought the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was purchased at the direction of Smollett, who paid $3,500 and promised an additional $500 later, according to De Mar.

Smollett could get between one to three years in prison if he is found to have filed a false report with the Chicago Police, per Illinois State law.

Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Company, the network that airs Empire, will reportedly keep Smollett on as a series regular.

“Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d,” according to TMZ."

Indeed, many celebrities are beginning to turn on Smollett amid reports that he faked a racist hate crime against himself.

Rapper Cardi B claimed that she feels “like he fucked up Black History Month.” Activist Alyssa Milano didn’t take the news so well, instead pleading with reality, hoping that it wasn’t true.

In fact, more Democrats than Republicans are willing to support violence if their side loses the 2020 election, says the study, titled “Lethal Mass Partisanship.”

The 2018 study debunks the widespread supposition among media analysts and Democratic partisans that Trump supporters are more violent than Democratic partisans. For example, CNN analyst Chris Cillizza relied on this fake news to explain why many Democrats rushed to believe the claim by actor Jessie Smollett that he had been mugged by two Trump supporters in the sub-zero streets of Chicago. Cillizza wrote February 19:

When actor Jussie Smollett said he had been beaten and left with a noose around his neck by two men shouting slurs and pro-Trump messages in Chicago last month, Democratic politicians couldn’t issue sweeping condemnations quickly enough. … On and on it went. Why? Because it seemed so ready-made for politicians hoping to make a point about the poisoning of our culture by Trump and his ilk: Smollett is gay, black and an outspoken critic of Trump. Of course Trump supporters reacted violently!

The academic study uses data extracted from two surveys to test the truth of claims that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe the other party is “a serious threat to the United States, [that] only ingroup partisans want to improve the country, and [to accept] breaking rules to oppose the outparty.”

The study breaks the media’s narrative by concluding that “warm feelings toward Trump are unrelated to all three items.”

The study also reported that Democrats were more likely to approve of violence than Republicans if the other party wins the 2020 election:

Nine percent of Republicans and Democrats say that, in general, violence is at least occasionally acceptable. However, when imagining an electoral loss in 2020, larger percentages of both parties approve of the use of violence – though this increase is greater for Democrats (18 percent approve) than Republicans (13 percent approve).

The data shows a 4 point jump among GOP partisans — from 9 percent to 13 percent — should the Democrats win 2020, but a 9 percent spike — among Democrats. The Democrats’ conditional acceptance of violence doubles, from 9 percent to 18 percent, should Trump win reelection in 2020.

The data is based on a 2017 survey of 1,000 people by YouGov.com.

When questioned by Breitbart News, the two authors downplayed their study’s conclusions that Trump’s partisans are not more supportive of violence than are Democratic partisans. Nathan Kelmore, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, told Breitbart News:

Overall, the lack of general party differences is consistent with several past studies testing less extreme versions of negative partisanship. For that reason, minimal party differences probably won’t surprise other scholars much … We didn’t measure level of societal threat, making threats, or violent actions, so our evidence can’t generalize that far, but we don’t find any consistent partisan differences for these hostile and violent attitudes in the general public. Violent attitudes are uncommon, hostile attitudes are more common, but neither differs by party. … We measured 4 violence items, and for the other three, Republicans were marginally more approving of violence (threatening leaders, harassing people online, advocating partisan violence in general) than were Democrats. The Democrats only grow more approving when encouraged to think of losing the 2020 election. This is consistent with what we would expect the party out of power to do.

Both Jocqui Smollett and Jurnee Smollett-Bell reposted a quote on Instagram attributed to Malcolm X, in which the late Muslim minister and activist is critical of the media. “This is the media, an irresponsible press. It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal. If you aren’t careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”

Malcolm X uttered the phrase during a 1964 speech in Harlem and used the words press and newspapers instead of “media” as stated in the quote shared by the Smollett siblings.

Smollett-Bell, who played Nicole Wright in the smash HBO series True Blood, then shared a screenshot from her brother of a tweet in support of the Empire star. “I have a feeling even if we had video of Jussie [Smollett] being attacked…y’all would still discredit him,” the tweet written by “@imgionni states. “Because it’s easier to believe what aligns with your contempt for survivors of hate crimes, sexual abuse, etc who happen to be LGBTQ+, disabled, or women.”

The Smollett siblings’ words of support come as Jussie Smollett refuses to meet with Chicago police after detectives obtained “new evidence” while interrogating two Nigerian brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — said to have helped orchestrate the assault.

CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported Saturday that at least one of the brothers bought the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store in the days leading up to the alleged staged attack. Smollett is said to have directed the purchase of the rope, and paid the brothers $3,500 and promised an extra $500.

Smollett, who is both African-American and gay, told police that two masked men shouted racist and anti-gay insults at him and poured an unknown chemical substance on him as he made his way back from a restaurant early on the morning of January 29. The actor claimed his assaulters looped a rope around his neck and told him “This is MAGA country!” before running away.

Smollett’s lawyers say their client was “angered” and “further victimized” by accusations that he staged the incident.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

Ilhan Omar.

Pat used Farrakhan's words against him to serve as a reminder to the audience of the double standard society has imposed on the different races and beliefs.

Click here to watch the full episode.

In Farrakhan's own words

Fox News host Sean Hannity reported on this Farrakhan statement during his annual Saviours' Day event in Chicago, ""The wicked Jews want to use me to break up the women's movement. It ain't about Farrakhan; it's about women all over the world [who] have the power to change the world,""

Farrakhan went on to say:

Ms. Omar from Somalia — she started talking about 'the Benjamins' and they are trying to make her apologize. Sweetheart, don't do that. Pardon me for calling you sweetheart, but you do have a sweet heart. You sure are using it to shake the government up, but you have nothing to apologize for. Israel and AIPAC pays off senators and congressmen to do their bidding, so you're not lying. Stop laying down. You were sent there by the people to shake up that corrupt House.

The takeaway

Pat highlighted the difference in how Farrakhan is treated compared to how conservatives are treated by the media and on social media. Farrakhan spews racism and Omar posts anti-Semitic tweets without a peep or challenge from the media. Meanwhile, conservative voices in media and on social medial are silenced and banned for telling the truth.

Pat also noted the double standard that allows Farrakhan to have a platform where he speaks without censorship, while conservatives are called racists and bigots for questioning the motives of Jussie Smollett.

The 36-year-old — whose claims he was the victim of a Chicago hate attack are unravelling — will see his scenes on the hit show drastically cut, TMZ reports.

According to the gossip website, Smollett was slated for nine scenes and a musical extravaganza for an upcoming Empire episode but that has been drastically cut.

Smollett claimed last month he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in the Windy City.

But now, police suspect that Smollett paid two pals to stage the assault.

Investigators received a tip from a witness claiming he was previously with the two men who allegedly attacked him in his apartment building.

The two suspects — who are brothers and allegedly wearing masks — were arrested and then released.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month.

In Smollett’s dramatic telling of the tale, his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Last week, cops announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges.

Now, detectives want to talk to Smollett again but have so far declined to characterize the “attack” as a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Smollett claimed his attackers yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Cops couldn’t find any video footage of the attack.

Cops said Monday that brothers — Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — are no longer suspects.

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM, the men said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”"

Dave Chappelle took aim at Jussie Smollett at a Thursday performance in Charlotte, N.C.

Chappelle joked that a report that the gay Empire actor faked an attack against himself ""made him so mad he wanted to break a dollhouse over the star’s head,"" an attendee of the standup set at the Belk Theater, Jeff Taylor, wrote in NewNowNext.

The joke referenced a tweet from Kevin Hart, whose resurfaced statement that he would slam a dollhouse over his son's head if he suspected he might be gay led to his stepping down as host of this year's Academy Awards. Chappelle defended Hart at his Thursday performance, saying he was ""obviously joking"" and likely now laughing at the controversy surrounding Smollett.

Chappelle had used Yondr — a pouch that locks away mobile phones — for attendees at the venue, so there is no audio or video recording of the set available yet.

While the audience was thus disconnected from the internet, Chappelle read breaking news about Smollett to the crowd, involving sources who said the Chicago Police Department was investigating whether the gay actor conspired with two men to fake an attack on him in the early hours of January 29. These reports were denounced by police soon afterward, which was not mentioned by Chappelle during his set.

However, the report did spur Chappelle to devote some time Thursday in his hour-long performance to questioning Smollett's claims, which he said even Scooby Doo, the cartoon detective dog, would have been skeptical of. Smollett told police he was attacked by two men who hurled racist and antigay slurs at him, screamed ""MAGA,"" beat him, poured an unknown liquid on his body, and hung a rope around his neck.

Smollett never said his attackers were wearing MAGA hats — a refrence to President's Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan — with ski masks, but Chappelle included this rumor in his listing of the actor's claims. Smollett did say one of his attackers asked, “Aren’t you that f*ggot Empire n*gger?” Chappelle said it sounded more like a statement he himself would say, rather than an Empire viewer.

In his Charlotte set, Chappelle expressed anger multiple times that the Smollett case may discredit other victims of hate crimes, and joked that he hoped that ""the gays"" would receive the lion's share of the backlash.

Chappelle also addressed the past criticism he's received from ""the alphabet people,"" his term for the LGBTQ community. The comedian has received backlash from the transgender community, in particular, due to transphobic jokes in his Grammy Award-winning Netflix specials.

However, the comedian dismissed this criticism as internet anger that he believed is not indicative of how most LGBTQ people feel the real world. When he sees trans people, he said, “They’re just like, ‘Heyyyy!’” Chappelle said, miming an enthusiastic greeting with a smile and a limp wrist.

Chappelle also relayed a conversation he had with his son Sulayman, who expressed frustration that others habitually sided with a transgender friend in disagreements. “Yo, son, they get on my nerves, too,"" the comedian said he confided to his son, as reported by the Charlotte Observer in its coverage of the event. Chappelle then delivered a message to his transgender critics.

""Just because [you’re trans] doesn’t make you right about every goddamn thing,"" he added. ""You right about a lot of [expletive], but I mean ... just give these people their rights so I can say funny [expletive] again.""

The Charlotte Observer reported that Chappelle's set was met with ""raucous laughter"" from the crowd. The comedian also acknowledged the insensitive nature of his remarks — with a caveat.

""If I ever get in trouble for the things I say, I’ll say it right now: I’m going to apologize,"" he said. ""Just know: I’m not sorry."""

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service have expanded their investigation into hate mail received by Jussie Smollett to include the actor himself.

Smollett, who reported an alleged hate crime on January 29, has recently become a subject in the investigations swarming around him as the story continues to receive massive national attention. Two federal officials confirmed this most recent change in the investigation scope with ABC News on Tuesday.

No one has been charged in connection with the incident and police are still actively asking to re-interview Smollett.

The letter first arrived at Fox Studios in Chicago on January 22 before the now well-known reported incident a week later. It portrayed a stick-man being shot by a gun with hate language directed at the actor.

Substances were found in the envelope but were confirmed to be powdered Tylenol and an unknown protein substance by detectives.

Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, the two men who were picked up and released after giving local police new evidence into the investigation, have told investigators that Smollett paid them to help orchestrate the incident.

They also stated the motive behind the incident was connected to the letters in question not garnering any attention by local or national media once received, according to sources interviewed by ABC News.

During a police raid of the brother's home, a magazine was recovered as evidence by police, according to inventory sheet reviewed by The Advocate.



Earlier in the day, the Associated Press confirmed with Chicago police that they are investigating a tip that Smollett was seen with the two brothers at his apartment just hours before the attack. This was confirmed as unfounded after police interviewed the witness.

""CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives,"" a Chicago spokesperon informed reporters by the afternoon.

Smollett was not able to be reached for comment on any of these matters at the time of reporting."

Haley was the governor of South Carolina in 2015 when a true hate crime was perpetrated against African-Americans by white supremacist Dylan Roof in the Charleston church shooting.

Dylan killed nine members of the Emmanuel AME Church, including the congregation’s senior pastor.

Last month, Smollett told police that two white men physically attacked him after making racial and homophobic slurs in the upscale Streeterville neighborhood on Chicago’s north side.

The 36-year-old “Empire” star, who has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, claimed one of the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett further alleged his assailants “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him and put a noose around his neck.

CBS affiliate WBBM-TV reported that sources informed the news outlet that Chicago police are seeking to interview the actor again after receiving information the attack was staged. Smollett has so far declined the follow-up interview request.

Smollett is said to have paid two Nigerian men $3,500 to carry out the fake assault.

If these reports prove to be true, he faces the prospect of being charged with filing a false police report.

According to the Media Research Center’s Newsbusters, the big three broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, and NBC — spent 101 minutes covering Smollett’s alleged hate crime between Jan. 29 and Feb. 14, before his story appeared to unravel.

Since then, from Feb. 14 to 18, they have spent 55 minutes.

MRC contrasted that coverage with the 24 minutes dedicated by the networks in total in coverage to the real hate crime perpetrated against a white autistic man by African-American teens in Chicago following Trump’s election.

He was kidnapped and tortured by black teens in early January 2017. The perpetrators broadcast the incident on Facebook Live.

WBBM-TV reported they cut their victim and forced him to drink from a toilet and say, “F— Donald Trump,” “F— white people,” and “I love black people.”

In response to Smollett’s reported refusal to be interviewed by police, Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted, “No problem, its not like he faked a vicious hate crime and rehearsed it thoroughly to try to create a national narrative of hate against Trump supporters…”

Smollett told police that the two attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country” as they put a thin rope around his neck and poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him.

RELATED: A timeline of Jussie Smollett’s reported attack and its investigation

The actor denied allegations that the incident was staged in an interview on “Good Morning America” with anchor Robin Roberts, and said the attacks on his credibility have been hard to take. He called accusations that he was lying “ridiculous.”

Democratic politicians from across the country seized on the alleged invocation of President Donald Trump’s signature phrase — an acronym for “Make America Great Again.”

U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., whose district covers the South Side, wrote a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray the day after the attack was reported, asking the bureau to open a hate crime investigation.

“This is a hate crime plain and simple and I will not stand by while evil acts are inflicted on any citizen, especially not in my hometown,” Rush said at the time.

Three weeks later, Rush’s tone had softened considerably.

“Congressman Rush is aware of the recent reports citing law enforcement sources,” Rush’s spokesman, Ryan Johnson, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “While it is clear that this case is still developing he continues to believe that any allegation of a crime warrants a thorough investigation, regardless of the outcome. Mr. Rush will have no further comment until the investigation has concluded and the facts are definitive.”

The day the attack was reported to police, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. tweeted that the alleged incident “was an attempted modern day lynching.”

Earlier this week, Harris — a former federal prosecutor — said she still was concerned about Smollett’s claims, but stressed that the investigation was still ongoing.

“I think that the facts are still unfolding and I’m very concerned about, obviously, the initial allegation that he about what might have happened,” Harris was quoted as saying.

Like Harris, fellow presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called the incident “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

Asked about the case’s developments earlier this week, Booker told reporters: “I’m going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources.”

The day after the reported attack, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

However, the tweet was deleted from Pelosi’s account on Monday.

In a statement to People, a representative for Pelosi explained: “Given the turn in the investigation, we decided to no longer amplify the original accusation.”"

By Don Babwin / Associated Press

CHICAGO — Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for about 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”"

Rod Dreher, author of ""The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation,"" said Facebook blocked his article for The American Conservative while Daily Caller reporter Jen Kerns said Facebook did the same to her piece and that Instagram froze her account when Kerns put a link to her story in her Instagram bio, PJ Media reported.

What happened to Dreher?



""You are not allowed to say on Facebook that Jussie Smollett carried out a hate hoax,"" Dreher tweeted Sunday, showing an image of Facebook's blocking message.

The image indicates Facebook blocked Dreher's article because it violated the social media giant's ""Community Standards"" and that no other Facebook users could see it.

Facebook lifted the ban later on Sunday, the outlet said.

What happened to Kerns?

Kerns told PJ Media's Tyler O'Neil that Facebook blocked through Sunday her story titled, ""Is Jussie Smollett the modern Tawana Brawley"":

When Kerns attempted to place a link to that same article in her Instagram bio, she told PJ Media that Instagram froze her account ""to protect our community"" until she deleted the link:

The outlet emphasized that Dreher's piece noted reporting on the Smollett case and included his opinion on the hoax chatter now surrounding it while Kerns' article compared Smollett to Brawley, who in 1987 falsely accused four white men of rape.

What did Facebook and Instagram have to say?



Neither Facebook nor Instagram on Tuesday immediately responded to TheBlaze's request for comment on Dreher's and Kerns' assertions.

What else did Dreher say?

Dreher addressed the Facebook block in a follow-up article:

I fully support Facebook or any other social medium having a policy of banning certain material (porn, neo-Nazi propaganda, etc.). But when you can't talk about hate hoaxes in general, or about a celebrated hate hoax in particular? Presumably my blog post violated Facebook's ""hate speech"" prohibition (I can't find any of their other Community Standards that it might have violated). Facebook's policy on ""hate speech"" is here. This, I suppose, is what my blog post violated:



But the entire reason for the post is new evidence indicating that Jussie Smollett was NOT a victim of a hate crime, but rather faked a hate crime!"

But Facebook users who say so just might get shut down.

According to a report from American Conservative writer Rod Dreher, a Facebook user who posted Dreher’s story titled “Jussie Smollett’s Hate Hoax” on Facebook had it taken down because it violated the social media giant’s “community standards.”

The “Hate Hoax” piece began by excerpting the latest reports involving the Smollett case, including one from CNN.

“Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault,” the piece read.

“The brothers, who were arrested Wednesday, were released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ‘new evidence.’ The sources told CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

“Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were ‘yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.’ He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

“The sources told CNN that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.”

Dreher piece then went on to catalogue all of the people who uncritically believed Smollett’s story, including media outlets, politicians and celebrities.

This wasn’t anything particularly new or scandalous. In fact, stories like these have appeared not infrequently over the past few days as it’s become clear Smollett’s case is falling apart.

But apparently, it was too much for some delicate sensibilities at Facebook, as Dreher demonstrated with a Twitter post:

You are not allowed to say on Facebook that Jussie Smollett carried out a hate hoax. pic.twitter.com/jnFx7aQFbS — Rod Dreher (@roddreher) February 17, 2019

The post was apparently made by a friend of Dreher.

“The link below on my wall is to Rod Dreher’s blog post that has been blocked by FB for ‘violating community standards,’ if you can believe it. So, what I did was create a tiny url of it just to see how long it stays up,” the Facebook user wrote, according to Dreher.

“If FB blocks it, I am outta here, and I hope some of you will join me. The type of soft totalitarianism that this company employs in order to silence dissent runs counter to the underlying purpose of communication: to speak and learn the truth. That, of course, means that we may stumble once and (sic) a while, which is what I have done on occasion.

“However, as long as we welcome correction and issue it with charity to others, we all benefit. FB, by short-circuiting that process in the name of protecting a particular ‘narrative,’ harms us all. Growth, whether spiritual or intellectual, sometimes requires that we hear and see things that not only challenge our cherished beliefs, but cause us real emotional pain. To try to purposely avoid such incidents is to advance the cause of ignorant docility. It is at bottom, paradoxically, inhumane.”

Dreher, at least, took his friend’s advice:

I have just deactivated my Facebook account. — Rod Dreher (@roddreher) February 17, 2019

Dreher reported that his friend later told him the post was unblocked.

“If true, that’s good news — but the fact that FB blocked it in the first place is a very troubling sign. I’m not going to reinstate my account. I’m done with Facebook.”

This isn’t the first time that Facebook has blocked innocuous content because it involved an account that did not match its liberal-loving worldview. In a recent case in the news, which happened just last month, came when a user called an alleged cop killer an “unvetted illegal immigrant,” compared with the cop he allegedly killed, who was a “vetted legal immigrant.”

Dreher’s post was positively anodyne compared to that, however. There was literally nothing that seemed to be controversial, unless you consider the statement that Smollett’s story was more likely than not a hoax to be a source of grave controversy.

Incidents like these are why conservatives don’t trust Facebook, and they have every reason not to.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question.

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett and that, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people that he is OK and thanking them for their support. He says he is working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California , opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” They question them about the case. Police also search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified only as Nigerian brothers by police — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he says.

Feb. 19

— Chicago police say they’re investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe."

The Jussie Smollett investigation recently made a major turn when new reports said the two Nigerian brothers arrested for the alleged assault against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett were paid to stage the attack. Authorities no longer list the two brothers as suspects in the case. Production sources told TMZ on Feb. 19 that Smollett’s screen time was cut significantly.

The actor could face time in prison for potentially filing a false police report. While authorities have yet to release a new statement, it comes as similar high-profile hate crime hoaxes plague the Trump era.

1. Vandalized Indiana Church

After President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, a church in Brown County, Indiana, which recognizes same-sex marriage, was allegedly vandalized with “Heil Trump,” swastikas, and an anti-gay slur. It was later revealed that the incident—which generated widespread media coverage and stoked fear in the community at St. David’s Episcopal Church—was a hoax.

The church’s gay organ player George Nathaniel Stang was the perpetrator. Stang faced a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief for vandalization.

2. Brooklyn Synagogue and Fires

Trump supporters took the blame for a series of hate crimes including Nazi vandalism at a Brooklyn synagogue and fires in a Jewish community—just days after the Pittsburgh massacre. The perpetrator was actually an African-American man named James Polite who worked for Christine Quinn, a New York City council speaker at the time. Polite faced four counts of criminal mischief as a hate crime and making graffiti.

3. Mississippi Black Church Fire

A historic black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire about one week before the 2016 presidential election and was widely dubbed a hate crime when the words “Vote Trump” were found spray-painted on the outside of the charred building.

An investigation soon revealed that the perpetrator was not a Trump supporter but an African-American member of the church named Andrew McClinton. He was charged with first-degree arson of a place of worship.

4. Muslim Student Assault Hoax

Also in 2016, a Muslim student at the University of Louisiana claimed two white Trump supporters physically attacked her and stole her hijab—the story went viral. But the Lafayette Police Department revealed later that the student had made up the whole story.

The young woman’s identity was not revealed and the university said they could not comment on if the student would face disciplinary action, citing federal privacy law.

5. Long Island Swastika Case

Trump’s name came up again in relation to a string of anti-Semitic graffiti across Nassau Community College in Long Island. The perpetrator was actually 20-year-old student Jasskirat Saini.

Authorities said Saini drew 110 swastikas—along with phrases such as “KKK,” and “Heil Hitler”—as a reaction to what he believed were insults from the Jewish community. The student’s graffiti spree started before Election Day in 2016.

6. NYC Subway ‘Attack’

A Muslim woman lied that she had been attacked by three white Trump supporters in New York City while on the subway. She claimed the men had tried to rip off her hijab while screaming “Trump! Trump!” in December 2016.

Yasmin Seweid, 18, was charged for filing a false report and for obstructing governmental administration, the police said, both misdemeanor charges. She was a student at Baruch College.

7. Fake Note and Slashed Tire

A 19-year-old student Adwoa Lewis lied to police in September 2018 about a hateful note on her car and a slashed tire. Lewis said a group of teens yelled “Trump 2016” after confronting her and told her she “didn’t belong here.”

Authorities found that she had faked the whole incident. Lewis admitted she had written the note herself and placed it in her vehicle. She was charged for faking a punishable written statement.

8. Graffiti on Campus

In November 2018, students at Goucher College demanded social justice training and safe spaces after racist, Nazi, and KKK graffiti were found on campus. Someone even wrote the names of black students. Trump supporters were blamed.

Authorities charged a biracial student at Goucher College near Baltimore after he had confessed to the race hoax.

Fynn Arthur, 21, wrote down the phone numbers of three black students, including himself, as well as a swastika on a campus bathroom stall in December 2018 to fake a racially motivated threat. At the time, a number of students at the college demanded social justice training and safe spaces as a response to the now debunked incident. Arthur, an African-American himself, later confessed to the crimes and faces two counts of malicious destruction of property."

Chicago Police have ruled out a tip suggesting Jussie Smollett was seen in the elevator of his apartment building with the two Nigerian-descent brothers who have been questioned over the attack he is accused of fabricating.

Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed told DailyMail.com on Tuesday that police had been told the trio were seen together on the night of the attack and that investigators are working to verify or rule out the claim.

'We are investigating the validity of the tip but someone called police this morning to report that the three may have been seen in an elevator together,' he said.

However a few hours later they released a statement saying the claims were unfounded.

'CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.'

It came as unnamed police sources cited by CBS revealed that the brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, were filmed getting a ride-share to the spot where the attack allegedly happened at around 2am and that they seemed 'nervous' in footage from inside the car.

Smollett did not return home to his apartment on January 29, the day of the attack, until after midnight.

He had been in New York for a reading of a play about a gay baseball player who suffers a homophobic attack similar to the one he claims he later suffered.

The actor then returned to Chicago late due to flight delays, which he documented on his Instagram story.

At around 2am, he went out to get a sandwich from a Subway near his building and claims he was jumped on his walk home.

It leaves a narrow window of time for him to have been seen in the building with the brothers before the alleged attack was reported at 2.42am.

There is surveillance footage of Smollett walking home before he was attacked. He was also filmed walking back into the building with a rope around his neck, but there is no footage of the ambush itself.

Last week, police announced that the 'investigation had shifted' following interviews with the brothers, adding fuel to speculation that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack.

Police declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax and have requested another interview with Smollett.

On Monday, it was reported that the actor may now face felony charges for filing a false police report about the alleged attack that shocked the world last month.

Smollett did not return home to his apartment on January 29, the day of the attack, until after midnight. At around 2am, he went out to get a sandwich from a Subway near his building and claims he was jumped on his walk home. There is only a small window of time for him to have been seen in the building with the brothers before the alleged attack was reported at 2.42am

Police combed through hours of surveillance video from the area where Smollett claimed he was assaulted but found no footage of the attack.

They did find video that shows two people, believed to be Abel and Ola Osundairo, in the area around the time of the alleged incident.

The brothers were taken into custody by police at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Wednesday as they returned from Nigeria. Investigators questioned the men about the attack and searched the apartment where they live.

Abel and Ola were arrested on suspicion of assault and held for about 48 hours before being released without charges on Friday after allegedly telling investigators that Smollett, who knew them, paid them to do it and told them to buy the rope he said was placed around his neck.

The brothers released a statement on Monday to say they were 'not homophobic, not racist and not anti-Trump' but they are yet to say anything else.

After DailyMail.com revealed that it was them who had been taken in to be questioned and that the pair knew Smollett and had even trained in his gym, the actor released a statement to say he found it 'impossible' that they could somehow have been involved.

The Empire star is due to speak to investigators again, and his team of attorneys says he is cooperating fully.

Over the weekend it was revealed that he had hired the same criminal defense attorney used by President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

His lawyers released a statement on Saturday saying the actor was angered and 'victimized' by claims that he may have played a role in staging the incident.

'Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,' attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson wrote.

In a tearful interview on Good Morning America last week, Smollett wept as he said he was telling the truth and was hopeful that surveillance camera footage of the attack would soon be found to quieten his doubters.

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident

Police sources cited by CBS and ABC but that have not yet been confirmed have suggested he made up the attack because he wanted more publicity, either because he feared he was being written out of the show or because a threatening letter he claimed to receive a week earlier did not get enough attention.

ABC reported Tuesday that the FBI and US Postal Inspection Services officials are now questioning whether Smollett may have written the letter, which featured the message 'You will die black fuck' in cut-out magazine letters alongside a stick figure hanging from a tree.

The letter - delivered to Fox's studio on January 22 in an envelope with the word 'MAGA' scrawled in red - is now at an FBI crime lab for analysis.

Smollett posted multiple Instagram stories documenting his flight delays on the night of his alleged assault. A source with knowledge of the probe told DailyMail.com that investigators believe the stories were posted so Smollett could alert Abel and Ola ahead of the attack

A source with knowledge of the probe told DailyMail.com on Monday that investigators now believe Smollett documented his flight delays on the night of January 28 in order to alert Abel and Ola ahead of the attack.

That theory could explain why a woman in Smollett's building claimed to have seen two men with a rope loitering near the residences approximately 90 minutes before the alleged incident.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department was unable to confirm those details due to the ongoing investigation.

'While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include additional investigation and speaking to the individual who reported the incident,' Guglielmi told DailyMail.com on Monday.

Last week, TMZ reported that Smollett gave a heavily redacted PDF print-out of his phone bill to prove that he was talking to his manager, Brandon Z Moore, when he was attacked.

Police would not confirm that report, but said the phone records Smollett provided were not enough to prove that he was on the phone with Moore.

'We continue to investigate but the records are insufficient to corroborate some of the information,' Guglielmi said last week.

'We appreciate the cooperation but will be following up for some additional data.'"

tupungato/iStock(CHICAGO) — The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at “Empire’s” Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack, two federal officials confirm to ABC News.

The accusation, made by the two brothers who were persons of interest, has not been confirmed.

The letter, which was sent Jan. 22, is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, one of the sources said.

The latest in this ever-changing story comes hours after the two brothers claimed they helped Smollett concoct the alleged assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the “Empire” show’s studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News on Monday.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo have also told investigators that Smollett paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the Jan. 29 attack that he said occurred near his Chicago apartment, sources said.

Detectives are actively investigating the account of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, but thus far police have not independently verified the allegations, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News.

The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope — allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs — at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.

No one has been charged in connection with the case.

A spokesperson for Smollett said Monday the actor’s attorneys are keeping an active dialogue going with Chicago police on behalf of the actor.

Smollett told police that on Jan. 29, he was walking on a street near his apartment when he was attacked by two men. The attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs before hitting him, pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him — possibly bleach — and wrapping a rope around his neck, he told detectives.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a separate statement Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The feds are probing whether Jussie Smollett was involved in sending a suspicious threat letter to himself a week before he claimed to have been attacked by racists with a noose and bleach in Chicago, according to a report on Tuesday.

The FBI and US Postal inspectors are now investigating the claim by brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo that Smollett played a role in the letter delivered to Cinespace Studios on Jan. 22, two federal officials confirmed to ABC News.

The note — which featured the message “You will die black f-g” in cutout magazine letters and a crude drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree — is at an FBI crime lab for analysis.

“MAGA” was written in red across the envelope. The letter also contained a white powdery substance later determined to be aspirin.

Revelation of the federal probe came as sources told ABC that the Osundairo brothers told investigators that Smollett hatched an idea to stage the Jan. 29 attack because he was upset over the lack of attention generated by the threatening letter.

Police are investigating those allegations, and the brothers — who were arrested Feb. 13 but released without charges two days later — were spotted with their lawyer at the Leighton Criminal Court building on Tuesday, ABC reported.

The brothers met with cops and prosecutors at the courthouse, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, amid reports that a grand jury has been seated, possibly to investigate whether the attack was a hoax.

Reports have said Smollett paid the men $3,500 up front to fake the attack and was supposed to give them another $500 afterward.

A grand jury was set to begin weighing charges against Smollett as early as Tuesday, TMZ reported. He could face a felony rap if he is charged with filing a false police report.

The Osundairo brothers are expected to testify before the grand jury if they haven’t already done so, sources told CBS News.

Meanwhile, cops also got a tip Tuesday morning that Smollett and the brothers were spotted together around the time of the alleged 2 a.m. attack on the “Empire” actor, Guglielmi told The Post.

The tipster said he may have seen the trio in an elevator together at the North Water Apartments, where the actor lives — and possibly after the assault occurred.

“Detectives were sent this morning to validate that tip and investigate it,” Guglielmi said. “They are investigating it. It is unconfirmed. We haven’t validated it.”

Guglielmi said investigators planned to interview the man who provided the tip.

Later Tuesday, Guglielmi said cops did not believe the tipster’s information was credible, based in part on video evidence.

Smollett claims he was attacked steps away from where he lives in the tony Streeterville ­neighborhood.

He told cops that two strangers in black clothing shouted homophobic and racist slurs — as well as “This is MAGA country!” — before dousing him with a liquid, suspected to be bleach, and looping a rope around his neck.

Smollett’s claims were widely accepted at face value and condemned by pols including presidential candidates and US Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), and the Rev. Al Sharpton among others, some of whom have since backtracked.

Police in Chicago have also stopped referring to Smollet as a “victim” and are instead calling him “the individual who reported the incident,” according to CBS.

Smollett has denied staging the attack, and his lawyers issued a statement Saturday that said, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

Police have said they want to re-interview Smollett over new evidence that “shifted the trajectory” of their investigation following interviews with the Osundairo brothers last week.

But as of Tuesday, he had still not agreed to their request. Lawyers for Smollett and the Osundairos didn’t return messages.

The buff Osundairo brothers, budding actor-models who have worked on “Empire,” considered backing out of the planned attack, sources close to the investigation told CBS’ Chicago affiliate.

The pair took a ride share near the location of the assault on North Water Street and appeared nervous in the car’s surveillance camera in the hours before it happened, sources said.

Abimbola and Olabinjo, who got there before Smollett, were also seen sitting on a bench. The actor arrived a short time later.

Two of Smollett’s six siblings posted a message of support for the actor on Tuesday — as they trashed the “irresponsible media” for its continuous reporting on the unraveling story.

Smollett, 36, was scheduled to appear in nine scenes and a musical number in upcoming episodes of the Fox drama, TMZ reported. But five scenes and the performance have allegedly been cut from production, according to TMZ.

Questions have also been raised about the threatening letter Smollett said he received a week before he was allegedly attacked in Chicago.

“Smollett, Jussie, You will die, black f***,” read the letter, which appeared to be put together with letters cut out from magazines.

“MAGA” was written in place of a return address on the envelope, photos of the mail showed.

It also contained a white powder that authorities determined to be crushed Tylenol.

Former FBI criminal profile James Clemente pointed out the note resembled a ransom letter that appeared in a recent episode of HBO’s “True Detective.”

“It is very coincidental that a major television show, ‘True Detective,’ just used exactly that type of letter, with the cut out letters,” Clemente told Inside Edition. “It's something that is really Hollywood-orientated and we don't see that in the real world these days.”

When police raided the home of Abel and Ola Osundairo, the two brothers investigators said told them they were paid by Smollett to stage the attack, they took away a magazine and stamps. The person or persons who sent the letter could face federal prosecution.

Police said the brothers told them Smollett orchestrated the attack he claimed occurred in Chicago because he was upset the letter did not get enough attention.

Smollett is ""angered and devastated"" by the allegations he paid two men to stage an attack on him, his attorneys said.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” his attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement.

In the poll just released on February 18, Americans listed the government/leadership as the most important problem facing the United States. Thirty-five percent of those polled — a record — saw government as the key problem in the United States today.

The previous high number showing government as the biggest problem was in October of 2013. Ironically, both the 2013 poll and this year’s were taken during or adjacent to times of federal government shutdown.

The current percentage that see government as the biggest problem is almost twice as high as when the same question was asked last November.

A more in-depth analysis of verbatim responses shows that 11 percent of respondents specifically listed President Donald Trump as the most important problem in America. Five percent named “Democrats” or “liberals” as the top problem, and only one percent named “Congress.” Eighteen percent of respondents named both parties and a combination of “gridlock” and “lack of cooperation” as the main issue.

Individual Americans are likely to see different things as the main problem in the country. Only occasionally do 35 percent or more of those polled agree on any one problem facing the United States. The October 2001 poll, taken in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, showed that 46 percent of Americans believed that terrorism was the most important problem. As the economic meltdown of 2008 was occurring, 58 percent of respondents cited the economy as the biggest problem. In 2011, as President Obama was laying out an ambitious job creation plan, 39 percent saw unemployment as the major problem.

So, the news of the day seems to have a large effect on how everyday Americans see problems. The current survey was taken from February 1-10, directly after the federal government shutdown over funding for President Trump’s border wall.

Of other problems addressed, only immigration at 19 percent even breeched double digits. Last November when the same poll was taken, 21 percent of respondents named immigration as the top problem in America, tops in that particular poll. So, apparently, President Trump’s message and plans for a border wall are having some effect.

Only three percent of Americans see the economy as a problem currently. Despite the vast amount of coverage of the Covington kids and actor Jussie Smollett, which occurred during the polling, only five percent see racism/race relations as the main problem in America.

Three percent of respondents see the environment/pollution (which would include so-called climate change) as the main problem facing the United States.

Considering the questions being asked, the sample size seems rather low. Only 1,016 adults (age 18 and over) in all states and the District of Columbia were polled. The margin of error is plus or minus four percent.

Perhaps, in an uncomprehending way, the citizens who answered this poll got things right — sort of. The problem is that far too many of them see government as a dysfunctional overlord rather than a group of out-of-control employees of the people who need to be reined in.

In this poll, people seem to have reacted to the government shutdown, which put a quarter of the federal government’s employees — some 800,000 people — out of work for a month. What many miss about that is the fact that the federal government employs more than three million people. The fact that the federal government is the nation’s largest employer is a disgrace. Government was never intended to be a jobs program.

Government, with all its intrusion via regulation, burdensome taxation, cronyism, and privacy-invading laws, is a huge problem. And the fact that people still look to government to solve the problems of the nation is curious, especially when government is the cause of so many of them.

One unfortunate result of many getting their news via social media headlines or cable news show chyron is that this ends up being the critical part of the story. Its wording and structure is of paramount importance for those who only view the world through one line of text. Even those who read just the headline and the first few words can be misleading, hence the term ‘burying the lede’. Colleague Scarlett Madison made this important point in her article on how the NY Times shows how to be biased even when technically telling the truth.

This is just a sampling of the past few days with some of the more absurd examples. No doubt, the socialist media will conjure up even more in their quest to propagandise the public.

Daring United flight attendant takes a walk on a plane’s wing midair

While not political per se, this example from a few weeks ago merits special attention. The future museum of clickbait will most likely feature this one as the pinnacle of the art. Given the structure of the headline, the impression is that a ‘Daring’ flight attendant took a walk on the wing of an airliner at flight level 320 and 460 knots without any safety gear. When it was really on a Stearman at low altitude and 44 kts harnessed to the plane at all times, a daring stunt to be sure but not the one implied by the headline. Although one had to click-through the headline to find that out, which is exactly the point.

Raising a question without raising a question

Some headlines are a lesson of subliminal propaganda, with a one-line editorial meant to convey a certain idea that is never alluded to in the piece. In the case of an Associated Press story on the Aurora mass murder, at one point the headline read as follows:

Aurora shooting raises questions over gun permit checks

With the usual trope that existing restrictions on Liberty are never good enough, holding out the impossibility of one more tweak solving all problems, in this case throwing in the idea of so-called ‘Red Flags’ as being some sort of solution. The propaganda being that ‘questions’ really mean faults in the law necessitating even more limitations on Liberty – for our own good, of course.

On the same topic, we have a headline on the same story that puts the subliminal advertising industry to shame

Vigil set for victims of gun rampage at Henry Pratt Company in Aurora, Illinois

Most people having a modicum of logic will ignore the overt implications of the phrase ‘gun rampage’, but it does plant the subliminal seed that it wasn’t the person who caused this mass murder to take place, but instead it was a gun that when on a ‘rampage’.

This is part of the mistake we make in using terms such as gun control or anti-gun. It focuses attention on an inanimate object [An object many fear] instead of the truth of the loss of Liberty.

Two headlines deflecting attention and attempting damage control of the Left’s ‘Green New Deal’

GOP Green New Deal stunt is a great deal for Democrats

Here the close proximity of the GOP with the Green New Deal conveys the subtle implication that it belongs to them with the bonus that it will redound positively for the nation’s socialist Left. Following in the fine tradition of nation’s Left projecting their maladies on the Pro-Liberty Right.

Welfare for those ‘unwilling to work?’ It’s not as crazy as you might think.

“Unwilling”? The now-retracted FAQ made other eyebrow-raising claims, but conservatives pounced on that word in particular. Of a piece with the usual complaints about welfare as a reward for laziness, it was called extreme, absurd and, in one florid instance, a “Communist Manifesto, 21st Century.”

[Our emphasis]

Once again, we see the use of one of the Left’s favourite words whenever the Right points out the facts of a situation.

Finally, there is this little gem from the Birdcage liner of record

Republicans Already Are Demonizing Democrats as Socialists and Baby Killers

Leftist media sources must have a lexicon of selected words designed to elicit a certain reaction. The term ‘Pounce’ is one of their favourites. Commonly used whenever the Socialist-Left makes colossal mistake and we of the Pro-Liberty Media merely reports on what happened. No doubt this will be seen in the stories on the Jussie Smollett situation.

Demonise is another Leftist favourite that roughly translates to having them dead to rights in describing them. Like the over-used ‘pounce’ they tend to keep those little gems in describing those of us trying to conserve Liberty. The underlying pretense with the ‘D’ word is that it’s not precisely true. In this case with the subtle implication that even though the Left has embraced socialism as tightly as Al Gore hugging a polar bear they aren’t truly socialist. Never mind that most of the mob of presidential candidates signed on to the ‘Green New Deal’ before reading the fine print penned by Mao Zedong. Or that they’ve kept their distance from bills that would preserve the life of a baby after it’s born. Curiously enough, they also like to keep the Left’s obsession with gun confiscation out of the mix.

The Takeaway

The purpose of these one line editorials in the guise of a headline is not to inform, but imply certain ideas without being overt about it. These were just a few from a couple of days, consider the effect of a constant stream of them for year upon year.

This is why we have to be careful in how we counteract these deceptions in a single line, and why Conservative media sources are vital to the survival of Liberty.

Read the story here.

New clues have surfaced in the Jussie Smollett case, as TMZ reports the star’s scenes have been slashed from upcoming episodes of “Empire.""

The “Empire” star has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was attacked January 29 around 2 a.m. outside his Chicago apartment building by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, leaving him with a rope around his neck.

Insiders, however, say he hired brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to fake the attack.

Now, CBS 2 reports multiple sources claim Jussie was upset that a threatening letter sent to him at FOX Studios in Chicago didn’t get a “bigger reaction.”

The note, posted by ThatGrapeJuice.net, stated in letters cut out of magazines, “You will die black f**.” The letter was delivered January 22, over a week before the attack. It reportedly included a white powder that turned out to be aspirin.

ThatGrapeJuice.net

Jussie told “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts last week, “There was no address but the return address said in big red caps... MAGA. Did I make that up, too?”

The brothers, who had been identified from surveillance video near the scene, were arrested Wednesday and held by police for two days. They were not charged.

CBS 2 says Chicago police found a magazine at the Osundairos’ apartment, which was taken as evidence. Sources also say that the brothers purchased a rope at the Crafty Beaver Hardware store in Chicago and a red hat allegedly used in the incident at a local beauty supply store.

They spoke to CBS 2 exclusively saying, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Olabinjo has appeared on “Empire” as an extra. Jussie’s attorneys have also stated that one of the men had worked for the star as a personal trainer.

Earlier, insiders told TMZ that Olabinjo and Abimbola met with Jussie in advance to choose a location where a camera would capture a staged assault.

The alleged attack took place outside of Jussie’s apartment, but the security camera was pointed the other way.

The brothers supposedly rehearsed the attack, and the sources claim Smollett asked the guys to get somewhat physical, but to avoid serious injury.

The insiders went on to say that the two men were nervous the night of the assault, but carried out the plan, even making some “contact with Jussie’s face” that they insisted was “weak.” They couldn’t explain his bruising, as they did not intend to injure him.

CBS Chicago reported that Olabinjo and Abimbola were paid $3,500 for their part in the attack. They left for Nigeria the night it happened, and were reportedly supposed to receive another $500 upon their return.

TMZ says a grand jury could soon hear evidence in the case, and sources tell the site that the two men have agreed to appear, and have not been subpoenaed.

Jussie could be charged with filing a false police report, which is a felony, if the grand jury believes the story of the brothers.

On Saturday, Smollett's lawyers told “Extra” in a statement that Jussie was “angered and devastated” by reports he knew the attackers, and that he now feels “further victimized.”

Smollett’s lawyers released a statement to CBS on Tuesday, saying, “We are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie Smollett’s lawyers are in contact with the Chicago Police Department. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner that does not include talking to the media at this time.”

TMZ sources say “Empire” is currently shooting the show’s second-to-last episode of the season. Jussie’s scenes have reportedly been cut from nine to four, and a musical number featuring the musician was nixed. The scenes that are left reportedly don’t feature Jussie."

“Thoughts on Jussie Smollett case: He must be held accountable in the strictest way,” she said in a tweet. “He must repay resources used to investigate and serve time for the division he caused. The media should be the most outraged. He played all of them for fools. He knew they would cover it.”

Thoughts on Jussie Smollett case: He must be held accountable in the strictest way. He must repay resources used to investigate and serve time for the division he caused. The media should be the most outraged. He played all of them for fools. He knew they would cover it. — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) February 19, 2019

She’s absolutely right that Smollett needs to be held accountable and serve time for what he did. As others have been quick to point out, Smollett – a gay black man – did an extreme disservice to those who truly are victims. Though he is one of many who have falsely reported a hate crime attack, his platform as a popular actor elevates his profile, and the damage from what he’s done will last for a long time.

Where I disagree with Haley is when she wrote that Smollett “played all of them for fools.” Did he? I don’t think so.

The mainstream media lives for stories like Smollett’s. We saw it play out with the Covington kids story, too.

There was no restraint in their reporting. They chose not to wait for all the facts. They took an edited news clip which did not tell the full story, ran with it, and it spread like wildfire across social media, news sites, and broadcast networks.

By the time the full story was known, it was too late. Nathan Phillips was falsely portrayed as a free speech hero who was attacked by “racist MAGA hat kids” because he was a Native American.

The MSM never learns their lesson because they are rarely punished for getting it wrong. They also live in a world where confirmation bias clouds every bit of their reporting. Most of them are left-leaning and anti-Trump, so as soon as a tweet comes cross their Twitter stream about an “abusive MAGA hat wearer”, they jump on it, scream “Aha! Told ya so” and shelve their investigative instincts in a mad rush to judgment.

Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?

Contrast their full-court press journalisming with how they report on claims that conservatives and Republicans make. “Without evidence” has become the standard line in their tweets and news coverage. They’re very careful to make sure you know that whatever claim is being made by the person is just an assertion, not necessarily a substantiated fact.

If the media treated both sides this way, perhaps they wouldn’t be as distrusted as they are. But they don’t, so here we are.

Wash, rinse, repeat.

We're told Smollett is depending on his legal team in Chicago to handle the ongoing investigation into his alleged attack, as well as any other criminal issues that may arise out of that investigation.

However, the actor needs help dealing with the media, so he's seeking outside counsel with someone who will be able to answer questions from the press and conduct interviews.

Geragos is a wise choice, as he not only navigated Kaepernick to success, he's represented tons of celebrities in controversial legal situations like Chris Brown, Winona Ryder and Michael Jackson.

ABC/Image Group LA(LOS ANGELES) — As the Internet continues to question the legitimacy of Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack plot in light of new evidence, plain-spoken rapper Cardi B has taken to Instagram Live to flame him.

The latest reports now claim that Smollet staged the assault after he became upset that a now-suspicious letter allegedly threatening him, which was sent to Empire‘s studio, did not get enough attention.

“So, I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollet, [sic]” the Grammy-winning rapper began. “I feel like he f***** up Black History Month, bro.”

However, Cardi did not completely dismiss the seriousness of the Empire star’s claims.

She continued, “I don’t want to completely blame him. You know, police in Chicago are racists. So, they probably tryna’ frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.”

“But, if he’s not…then bro you f***** up for real. Why would you do that?”

Cardi’s comments follow the news that the two men implicated in attacking Smollett — brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo — told police the actor paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the January 29 attack.

Meanwhile, the FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are currently investigating whether Jussie Smollett played a role in sending that letter — which was addressed to the actor at Empire‘s Chicago studio prior to the alleged attack, two federal officials confirm to ABC News.

Bisexual rapper Cardi B. recently took to social media to express her frustration with Smollett, saying she’s giving him the benefit of the doubt… for now. But, she added, if it turns out he lied then he really “f*cked up Black History Month.”

Meanwhile, Comedian Dave Chappelle addressed the controversy during a recent stand-up set in Charlotte, North Carolina, telling the crowd he wanted to “break a dollhouse over [the actor’s] head” if he, indeed, lied about the attack.

Even Rev. Al Sharpton has weighed in, saying that if Smollett is being dishonest, he should face “accountability to the maximum”.

It’s very important to note that, so far, police say they do not question the veracity of Smollett’s account and that the investigation is still ongoing.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said Sunday, “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

But this hasn’t stopped memers from going after Smollett, accusing the 36-year-old actor of lying, even though the investigation into the attack is still open…"

Somehow the liberal media thinks this is appalling. Yes, please bash conservatives for celebrating that a horrible racially motivated attack didn’t happen. Is this for real?

Smollett is an actor on the Fox series “Empire.” He alleges that two white men attacked him on January 29 in Chicago. They punched him, threw bleach on him, and then tied a rope around his neck. Cue the progressive anti-Trump outrage—and it was loud and outright wrong.

The two individuals turned out to be Nigerian brothers who were allegedly paid by Smollett to attack him. They bought the rope used in the alleged assault; they were reportedly paid by the actor and held rehearsals. The two are now cooperating with the Chicago police. With these new developments, the Chicago police want a new interview with Smollett, who hasn’t made the time. Gee—could you wonder why? New York Times columnist Charles Blow said if Smollett actually faked this hate crime, he’s a total psychopath. Real Clear Politics had the clip and partial transcript:





JOHN AVLON, CNN HOST: Not that you can get inside his head, but he's the one raising this to a national element, which -- elevating it to a national conversation, which makes the possibility of it being a hoax that much more devastating. CHARLES BLOW, 'NEW YORK TIMES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well listen, if Jussie has done what the Chicago police say he has done, it's not just that he's an actor, Brian. This is an insane person. This is -- this is a psychopath -- like -- and there's nothing in his history that suggests that he's a psychopath. ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST: Well, why -- BLOW: That's why it's so hard for everybody -- that's why people are waiting, trying to figure out like please go back and interview him Chicago P.D. -- AVLON: Yes, got to do it. BLOW: -- because we need to understand what's the motive because nothing -- I've met him one time. He was the sweetest -- it was just in passing at Essence Fest and I was with a girl with a college -- she's a big fan. And he -- she had to have a picture. He was the most gracious person and I think that that's the kind of feeling that people have about him. So if you did this, we need to know -- like, are you crazy? Like, are you -- did you like literally lose it because nothing is adding up about why he would do this?

So far, one theory is that he was mad that a racist letter with a white powder, later determined to be aspirin, sent to him didn’t get enough media attention (allegedly). Given the insanity of this story, it’s not shocking to think that he could’ve have sent this letter to himself. The other possible reason is that he was about to be written out of the show, or that his role was going to be reduced.

Liberal actor Jussie Smollett is accused of staging a racist and anti-gay attack on himself, which Smollett blamed on supporters of President Donald Trump.

Smollett’s alleged fake “hate crime” appears to be the latest instance of liberals manufacturing hate crimes for attention in the Trump era.

The Daily Caller News Foundation compiled below some of the most outrageous fake hate crimes since Trump was elected, in rough chronological order:

Anti-Muslim Hate Crime in Michigan Turns Out to Be a Hoax (Nov. 2016)

A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention from national outlets like The Washington Post in November 2016 after she claimed a drunk 20-something man threatened to light her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax.

Bisexual Student Fakes Trump-inspired Hate Crime (Nov. 2016)

Taylor Volk, an openly bisexual senior at North Park University claimed to be the target of hateful notes and emails following Trump’s election in November 2016. Volk told NBC News that “I just want them to stop.” But the “them” referenced by Volk turned out to be herself, as the whole thing was fabricated.

Bisexual Student Fakes Trump-inspired Hate Crime (Nov. 2016)

Philadelphia woman Ashley Boyer claimed in November 2016 that she was harassed at a gas station by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. Boyer claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.” Boyer deleted her post after it went viral and claimed the men had been caught and were facing criminal charges. Local police debunked her account.

White Men Rob Muslim Woman of Her Hijab and Wallet — Except It Never Happened (Nov. 2016)

An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed in November 2016 that two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

Church Organist Vandalizes Own Church (Nov. 2016)

A church organist was arrested in May 2017 after he was found responsible for spray-painting a swastika, an anti-gay slur and the words “Heil Trump” on his own church in November 2016. When the story first broke, media outlets tied the hoax to Trump’s election. “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” The Washington Post reported at the time.

“Drunk White Men” Attack Muslim Woman in Story That Also Never Happened (Dec. 2016)

Another 18-year-old Muslim woman, this time in New York, was the subject of breathless headlines in December 2016 after she claimed to have been attacked by a group of Donald Trump supporters on a New York subway while onlookers did nothing. The woman, Yasmin Seweid, would go on to confess that she made the whole thing up.

White Guy Sets His Own Car on Fire, Paints Racial Slur on His Own Garage (Dec. 2016)

Denton, Texas, resident David Williams set his own car on fire and painted “n***** lovers” on his home’s garage, in an apparent attempt to stage a hate crime. Local police investigated the arson as a hate crime. Williams and his wife, Jenny, collected more than $5,000 from Good Samaritans via a GoFundMe page before the hoax was exposed.

Prankster Tricks Liberal Journalist Into Spreading Anti-trump Hoax (Dec. 2016)

As tales of Trump-inspired “hate crimes” were spread far and wide by liberal journalists after Trump’s election, one online prankster decided to test just easy it was to fool journalists. The prankster sent Mic.com writer Sarah Harvard a fictitious story in which a Native American claimed to have been harassed by an alleged Trump supporter who thought she was Mexican. Despite no evidence backing up the claim, Harvard spread the fake story, emails the prankster shared with The Daily Caller showed.

Student Writes Anti-Muslim Graffiti on His Own Door (Feb. 2017)

A Muslim student at Beloit College wrote anti-Muslim graffiti on his own dorm room door. The student was reportedly motivated by a desire to seek attention after a Jewish student was targeted with an anti-Semitic note.

Israeli Man Behind Anti-Semitic Bomb Threats in the U.s. (April 2017)

Media outlets didn’t wait to find out who was behind a string of bomb threats targeting synagogues and Jewish schools before linking the threats to Trump. A U.S.-Israeli man was charged in April 2017 and indicted in February 2018 for the threats. A former reporter for The Intercept was also charged in March 2017 with making several copycat threats.

Hoax at St. Olaf (May 2017)

Students at St. Olaf college in Minnesota staged protests and boycotted classes in May 2017 after racist notes targeting black students were found around campus, earning coverage in national media outlets like The Washington Post. It later came out that a black student was responsible for the racist notes. The student carried out the hoax in order to “draw attention to concerns about the campus climate,” the university announced.

Fake Hate at Air Force Academy Goes Viral (Sept. 2017)

The Air Force Academy was thrown into turmoil in September 2017 when horrific racist notes were found at the academy’s preparatory school. “Go home n***er,” read one of the notes. The superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, went viral with an impassioned speech addressing the racist notes.

“If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect–then you need to get out.”-Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, Superintendent @AF_Academy pic.twitter.com/njCktv5Fmp — U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) September 28, 2017

Two months later, authorities determined that one of the students targeted by the notes was also the person responsible for writing them.

K-state Fake Hate Crime (Nov. 2017)

A student at Kansas State University filed a police report in November 2017 over racist graffiti left on his car. “Go Home N***** Boy” and “Whites Only,” read the racist graffiti, which the the student later admitted to writing himself.

Racist Graffiti Carried Out by Non-white Student (Nov. 2017)

Another instance of racist graffiti that same month also turned out to be a hoax. A Missouri high school investigated after racial slurs were left on a bathroom mirror in November 2017, only to find that the student responsible was “non-white.”

Waiter Fakes Note Calling Himself a Terrorist (July 2018)

Texas waiter Khalil Cavil went viral after posting a Facebook picture of a racist note that he claimed a customer had left on the receipt, in lieu of a tip. The note described Cavil as a “terrorist.” Saltgrass Steak House, where Cavil worked, initially banned the customers for life, before their investigation revealed that the waiter had faked the racist note. “I did write it,” Cavil later admitted. “I don’t have an explanation. I made a mistake. There is no excuse for what I did.”

Waitress Fakes Racist Note, Blames Law Enforcement (July 2018)

A Texas waitress apologized in July 2018 after blaming local law enforcement for an offensive note targeting Mexicans. She later admitted to writing the note herself.

New York Woman’s Hate Crime That Wasn’t (Sept. 2018)

A New York woman was charged in September 2018 after police determined she fabricated a story about white teens yelling racial slurs at her and leaving a racist note on her car.

Student Faked Racist Notes (Dec. 2018)

Several racist notes at Drake University were actually the work of one of the students who had been targeted by them. “The fact that the actions of the student who has admitted guilt were propelled by motives other than hate does not minimize the worry and emotional harm they caused, but should temper fears,” university president Marty Martin said afterwards.

The Covington Catastrophe (Jan. 2019)

National media outlets pounced on a selectively edited video from the March for Life that showed Native American activist Nathan Phillips beating a drum in front of a boisterous group of boys from Covington Catholic High School.

Phillips originally told The Washington Post the students swarmed him while he was preparing to leave the Indigenous People’s March scheduled for the same day. Phillips originally said one student, who later identified himself as high school junior Nick Sandmann, blocked his path from leaving as he tried to do so. The extended video shows that wasn’t the case: Phillips approached the high school boys during their cheers, not the other way around. Some of the people with Phillips were directing racially charged language at the students, not the other way around.

Phillips told a second variation of his story to the Detroit Free Press. Phillips claimed he was playing the role of peacemaker by getting between the students and four “old black individuals,” whom he claimed the students were attacking. “They were in the process of attacking these four black individuals,” Phillip tolds the Michigan paper. “I was there and I was witnessing all of this … As this kept on going on and escalating, it just got to a point where you do something or you walk away, you know? You see something that is wrong and you’re faced with that choice of right or wrong.”

“These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey, and I stood in between them and so they needed their pounds of flesh and they were looking at me for that,” he added. Extended video shows that account also isn’t accurate. The four individuals Phillips referenced were members of the Black Hebrew Israelites and they launched racist and anti-gay slurs at the high school students, not the other way around.

Bonus: Anti-Semitic Vandal Exposed as Democratic Activist (Nov. 2018)

Anti-Semitic vandalism in New York City turned out to be the work of a Democratic activist, according to police. It wasn’t a hoax — the anti-Semitic vandalism was real — but the suspect wasn’t the right-winger some had assumed him to be. The man police arrested, based on surveillance footage, was 26-year-old James Polite, who had actually interned for City Hall on anti-hate issues.

Bonus II: Trump-Inspired Racist Blaze at Black Church Was Carried Out by Black Church-goer (Nov. 2016)

This hoax occurred one week before Trump was elected, but TheDCNF is including it as a bonus because it was so egregious. Leftist media outlets ran headlines like “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump” after a black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and spray painted with the words “Vote Trump.” The Washington Post’s original coverage of the incident read in part,” Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons called the fire a ‘hateful and cowardly act,’ sparked by the incendiary rhetoric of GOP nominee Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.” But the church was set on fire by one of the church’s own congregants, who is black.

Zachary Bryant, of Boy Scout Troop 213, chartered out of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, was hailed as a hero and honored by the Atlanta City Council on Monday for pulling a boy from another troop from the raging Nantahala River in North Carolina in late July during a summer whitewater rafting trip, WSB-TV reports.

“I knew I just had to help,” Bryant said about his brave act.

But Bryant, a student at Druid Hills High School gives all the honor to the Lord.

“I gave all the glory to God in this situation,” Bryant said. “I was able to reach out with my left hand and pull him into the boat.”

Bryant and an Eagle Scout who was with him worked together to scoop up the drowning troop member.

“Pulling him up with one hand. I mean, that’s just the strength of God,” Bryant said.

“It was an experience that I think every parent would have just been humbled by,” Bryant’s mother said.

The Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, of Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist church where Bryant’s troop is chartered, also applauded the scouts for their heroism.

“They are young men of faith, and they have deep compassion and empathy for others and they took all that, with a dose of courage, and they saved somebody’s life,” Warnock told reporters."

“So, I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the fuck his name is. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro,"" Cardi B said. ""I’m not gonna say … yet, until he said out his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged. I don’t wanna completely blame him, because, you know, like, somebody that I was talking to, they said, like, you know, police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try and frame him and make him look like he’s a liar, but if he's not, then bro, you fucked up, for real.”

She said if Smollett faked his alleged ""MAGA"" assault in Chicago, he would effectively give President Trump ""immunity to laugh at fucking n----s and shit."" Cardi B went on to recount her own experience with police, recounting a years-old road rage incident about which she claims police twisted the story even though she admitted she never provided police with a statement.

Cardi B wasn't the only celebrity to comment on the Smollett controversy recently as rapper Snoop Dogg shared a famous image of former football player OJ Simpson fleeing from police in his white Ford Bronco with Smollett's face superimposed on top of it. Snoop Dogg posted the image without providing a comment about whether he supports Smollett or not.

Police opened a hate crime investigation Jan. 29 after Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed he was assaulted by two white men who shouted racial slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Smollett also said the men told him this was ""MAGA country,"" a reference to Trump's ""Make America great again"" slogan.

Recent reports citing police sources say that Smollett may have paid two Nigerian-American brothers to disguise themselves and commit the attack for reasons unknown. The two brothers have released a statement through their lawyer claiming they are not ""anti-Trump"" and they have both been released by police without charges.

Chicago police say they want to conduct a second interview with Smollett. Although one of his lawyers said he declined to meet with authorities on Monday, they intend to maintain an open dialogue with police on his behalf."

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Yesterday, TMZ reported Smollett and the brothers had scouted a location to stage the attack a few days before it took place. They allegedly also discussed how the attack would take place including that there would be a fight but not one that would be too serious. That story hasn’t been confirmed on the record by police (though TMZ cites police sources) but if true it suggests Smollett was coordinating directly with the brothers beforehand.

Here’s my one hesitation on this latest report. If the brothers are cooperating with police and were in Smollett’s building the night of the attack, they would probably have told police that themselves as a way to prove their story was true. So it seems a little off to me that police got a tip from a 3rd party. Either this tip isn’t going to pan out or the brothers aren’t really helping their own credibility.

In a related story, TMZ reports that Smollett is now having his scenes in upcoming episodes of the show cut after the investigation took a turn toward a possible hoax:

Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d. As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.

And since this is TMZ, it’s worth noting that Deadline has heard the same thing, i.e. Smollett’s scenes have been slashed. It’s quite a turn around from last week when Fox and the writers rushed to defend him.

Even some of the people who came out for Smollett after the initial report of the attack are starting to backtrack a bit. Rapper Cardi B said on Instagram that she felt, “like he f–ked up Black History Month.” Even Alyssa Milano seems to be preparing for the worst:

If that man staged his own attack he is wrong in so many ways. No one could be that hurtful? To stage this? Right? To fuck with all of us by playing into our weaknesses & make it even harder for victims to come forward?! No one could choose to be that hurtful? Right?! RIGHT? — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) February 18, 2019

And here’s one last update. Smollett already has an attorney but this Chicago reporter says he may be about to get an upgrade:

NOW: Jussie Smollett may be lawyering up, WAY UP, his team’s talking with famed LA defense attorney Mark Geragos – whose rep’d Michael Jackson, Scott Peterson, Chris Brown & on.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for about 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Tip that Jussie Smollett Was in Elevator with 2 Brothers on Night of Alleged Attack Was 'Unfounded': Police

Update: After questioning the person who provided a tip that Jussie Smollett was spotted in the elevator of his apartment building with two brothers who were later questioned in the case, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the tip was “unfounded,” writing on Twitter late Tuesday: “CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.”

Police are investigating a tip by someone claiming Empire actor Jussie Smollett was in the elevator of his apartment building with two brothers who were later arrested and questioned in the case, only to be released without charges hours later.

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, are the same people as those identified in surveillance footage on the night of the incident.

On Tuesday, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Associated Press that a person who lives in Smollett’s building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

“We sent detectives out to validate the tip,” Guglielmi tells PEOPLE.

The brothers were arrested Wednesday but released Friday without charges after Guglielmi said investigators received “new evidence.”

On Saturday, multiple outlets reported that the brothers claimed that the Empire star paid them to stage the incident.

In a Saturday statement to the Associated Press, Guglielmi said, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

He added, “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

An attorney for the men, Gloria Schmidt, previously told CBS Chicago that the men know Smollett from working on Empire and go to the same gym on occasion.

Schmidt did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment

On Saturday, Smollett’s lawyers responded to the rumors that the alleged attack was staged.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the lawyers said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

The news that Empire star Jussie Smollett may have orchestrated his own hate crime certainly came as a shock to much of America. Joe Jervis, however, wasn’t exactly surprised.

Jervis, creator of the news blog Joe.My.God, has been covering LGBTQ-related news and events for 15 years. Several years ago, he decided he would only report on alleged hate crimes if at least one of three criteria were met: There had been an arrest, there was conclusive video evidence, or there were uninvolved eye-witness accounts. The recent assault of a gay man in Salt Lake City, which was captured on film, fits the bill. Jussie Smollett’s alleged assault—with no eye-witnesses, arrests, or video evidence—did not, but because Smollett is famous and the national media was already reporting the story, Jervis made an exception to his own rule. Still, not all his readers—whom, he says, are “overwhelmingly older gay men”—were buying it.

“I didn’t want to weigh in on if it was real or not, but from the comments and the emails I received, a lot of my readers were immediately skeptical,” Jervis told me in a phone interview. And while plenty of the comments on his posts about Smollett are sympathetic—gay men of a certain age tend to have experiences with hate—quite a few commenters anonymously expressed their doubts. ""As a Chicagoan—this is odd,” one comment reads. “Certainly, weirder things have happened, but this in downtown Chicago? Color me a Suspicious Susie—but hope Jussie is okay no matter what went down.”

The saga began three weeks ago, after Smollett reported to Chicago police that he was beaten and doused with bleach by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic epithets. Smollett was treated in the hospital, and early the next morning, TMZ broke the story, reporting that the attack occurred at around 2 in the morning on a sub-freezing night on the actor’s way home from getting a late-night sandwich at Subway. TMZ, on a tip from an unnamed source apparently close to the actor, claimed that the two perpetrators shouted, “This is MAGA country,” and tied a noose around Smollett’s neck. In a photo posted to the website, there’s a laceration on Smollett’s cheek, rope burn on his neck, and his face looks puffy and swollen.

The outcry was immediate. Nearly every national publication in America picked up the story and there was a massive outpouring of support for Smollett from fellow Empire stars and celebrities as well as gay rights groups, activists, and politicians. Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and a bevy of Democratic presidential hopefuls weighed in with their horror and support. Even Trump condemned the attack—and, for once, he didn’t immediately shift the attention to himself.

Of course, not everyone jumped to Smollett’s defense. While on the left, the response was largely to take Smollett’s claims at face value, plenty of right wing commentators and critics expressed doubt from the very beginning. And of course they did: Smollett blamed Trump voters. They had clear motivation to question the narrative he put forth: His story made Trump supporters look not just racist, but violent (which, indeed, some Trump supporters are). These conservative doubters are now gloating.

At the same time, those on the left who had misgivings mostly kept quiet. It’s a lot more socially acceptable to express your support of the victim of an alleged hate crime than it is to question whether it happened. Doubting the apparent victim of a hate crime was just too toxic a position to take.

Privately, though, people expressed skepticism, especially as strange details emerged. According to news reports and police statements, Smollett initially didn’t want to report the attack but he still left the noose around his neck until the officers arrived to take his statement 40 minutes after his manager called the police, because, Smollett said, he wanted to preserve the evidence. But if he didn’t want to report the assault, why in the world would he keep that rope around his neck? It just didn’t make sense.

The same day that the news broke, I started having off-the-record conversations with people—most of whom were some form of queer, none of whom were remotely close to being fans of Donald Trump—about why this story seemed so fishy. It was just too perfect, like a soap opera's version of a hate crime. A famous person was randomly targeted in the middle of a freezing cold night by two racists with a noose screaming, ""This is MAGA country"" in Chicago? Chicago has certainly had more than its share of racism both today and throughout American history—Martin Luther King, Jr. once referred to it as the most segregated city in America—but Hillary Clinton won Chicago in 2016 by nearly 84 percent. Obama won it by even more. While there are undoubtedly both racists and Trump supporters in Chicago, ""MAGA country"" it’s not.

The details kept getting stranger. There was a complete lack of video evidence even though nearly every street in Chicago has some sort of surveillance camera. And the story kept changing: First I read that Smollett broke a rib, then I read that he didn’t. First the Chicago police said that Smollett hadn’t mentioned anything about ""MAGA country""; then, when they interviewed him a second time, they said that he did. Were the attackers wearing MAGA hats, as MSNBC first claimed, or were they wearing black ski masks, as was later reported? A neighbor reported seeing “rednecks” loitering outside Smollett’s apartment building that no one else seemed to notice. A security guard reported that Smollett walked past him with a rope around his neck and didn’t say anything at all. None of it made sense, and my bullshit meter was wildly pinging.

I even wrote something about it on the day the first story broke. This was soon after Covington had faded from the news, and in light of everything the media got wrong in the initial coverage of that story, it seemed wise to wait until the investigation had proceeded before extrapolating something larger from this alleged attack. I didn’t say that I didn’t believe Smollett, but I did say we should withhold judgment until more information came forth. This post ultimately wasn’t published after my editor expressed some hesitation. While I did not agree with this decision, he was right: At that moment, anyone on the left who offered less than full support of Jussie Smollett was going to be attacked. And maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Certainly, I’d prefer to live in a world where the default position is to believe victims than to just assume that they are lying. Of course, we don’t have to choose one or the other. Some victims are genuine, some are not, and the only way to determine what’s real and what’s fake is to actually investigate.

Unfortunately, hate crime hoaxes in the LGBTQ community are hardly new. In the early years of Joe Jervis’s blog, he dutifully reported on alleged anti-gay hate crimes when they occurred. And then, after a number of them—for instance, the case of a Tennessee couple that burned down their own house and claimed they were targeted for being lesbians—ended up being either untrue or wildly exaggerated, he decided not to report on allegations unless they were backed up by evidence.

Jervis had good reason for caution: Violence, like many social phenomena, can be contagious. This is true of suicide and mass shootings, which have been shown to spike after high-profile incidents. The more the media publicizes hate crimes, the more likely they may be to happen. And this includes hate crime hoaxes as well.

“Some messed up people see the attention others get from being the victim of a hate crime and they want some of that for themselves,” Jervis told me. “It’s a way of helping their hurt.”

Of course, the repercussions of falsely reporting a hate crime are enormous, and not just for the perpetrator, who can be (and, in Smollett’s case, may very well be) charged with false reporting. Hate crime hoaxes have the same effect as actual hate crimes: They create panic and terror. Often, as in Smollett’s case, it’s the perpetrator's own community that suffers. Queer black people in Chicago were led to believe that there are racist white men roaming the streets with nooses and bleach looking for victims, and, as multiple think pieces argued in the days after the attack, if Jussie Smollett isn’t safe, who is?

If Smollett did make this story up, his lie will be used to dismiss the actual victims of hate crimes going forth.

According to the FBI, reports of hate crimes increased 17 percent between 2016 and 2017. It’s important to note that there were 1,000 more law enforcement agencies reporting hate crimes in 2017 than there were in 2016, as Robby Soave pointed out in Reason, and that likely accounts for some of the rise. But as we saw in the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, hate crimes do happen in the US. Just Monday, Maajid Nawaz, a writer and former Islamic extremist who now works as a counter-extremism expert, was reportedly attacked in London by someone who allegedly called him a “fucking Paki.” (There were, according to Nawaz, multiple witnesses as well as CCTV footage of the attack.) These reports should be taken seriously. But hoaxes make all claims of hate claims less likely to be believed. We're seeing this in real time: The Oregonian reported on two alleged hate crimes in Portland on Monday and most of the comments on the post reference hoaxes or Jussie Smollett. (In one case, the police say the alleged victim was ""intoxicated and appeared to have fallen,” but a GoFundMe reportedly set up for the alleged victim has, as of this writing, raised almost $10,000.)

At this point, it looks as though Smollett paid two Nigerian American friends to help him stage the attack. (While I'm all about diversity in casting, in this case, it seems like the director would have been wise to cast villians who were a little more white). If this ends up being what happened, Smollett has given a tragic gift to the conservative right and the Trump administration. He tearfully claimed on Good Morning America that if his attackers had been black, Mexican, or Muslim—and if he weren’t an outspoken Trump critic—everyone would have believed him, no doubt. When Trump screams “fake news,” this is the kind of thing he is talking about, and while most national and Chicago reporters did a very good job of simply reporting the facts as they changed, the vast majority of hot takes and opinion pieces—which are not the same as reporting—were squarely on Smollett’s side. When Chicago reporters covering the story did cast doubt on Smollett's story, some were accused of spreading misinformation or of being homophobic and racist themselves. Trump and his cronies at Fox News will use this event as further evidence that the mainstream media is irreparably biased, and plenty of people will believe them.

The penalties for filing a false police report vary by jurisdiction and can include both fines and time in prison. As of this week, Jussie Smollett’s lawyers were still claiming he’s the victim, but as more details emerge, it seems less and less likely to be true. There could be, however, one small silver lining to this whole sorry tale, and that's this: Jussie Smollett wasn't actually attacked and beaten by noose-wielding bigots in Chicago. No matter his reasons or the consequences of this charade, if an assault didn't occur, that's something Americans across the political spectrum should be glad about."

It appears that Jussie Smollett will join the long list of performers who have manufactured hate crimes in the Trump era.

Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men shouting “This is MAGA country” near his Chicago apartment on Jan. 29. Suspicion that it was all a hoax was bolstered after reports said that the Empire actor had paid two friends to help stage the “assault.”

TMZ reported on Feb. 19 that there is a 50/50 chance that a grand jury will begin weighing an indictment of Smollett, who could be charged with felony filing a false police report.

Washington Times correspondent Rowan Scarborough noted that a “ ‘fake news’ subculture of hoaxes, post Donald Trump’s campaign and election, has erupted.”

“Whether its anti-black graffiti at the Air Force Academy Preparatory School, nooses in Mississippi or Catholic students at the Lincoln Memorial, hoaxes have become a common tactic of the Left. The trend has two key points: The hoaxes rail against America as an intolerant evil place, and they are instantly embraced by the mainstream media, Hollywood and liberals.”

Some of the most outrageous fake hate crimes since President Donald Trump was elected:

November 2016 – A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention from national outlets like The Washington Post after she claimed a drunk 20-something man threatened to light her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax.”

November 2016: Taylor Volk, an openly bisexual senior at North Park University claimed to be the target of hateful notes and emails following Trump’s election. Volk told NBC News that “I just want them to stop.” But the “them” referenced by Volk turned out to be herself, as the whole story was fabricated.

November 2016: Philadelphia woman Ashley Boyer claimed she was harassed at a gas station by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. Boyer claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.” Boyer deleted her post after it went viral and claimed the men had been caught and were facing criminal charges. Local police debunked her account.

November 2016: An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed that two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

December 2016: An 18-year-old Muslim woman in New York claimed to have been attacked by a group of Donald Trump supporters on the subway while onlookers did nothing. The woman, Yasmin Seweid, would go on to confess that she fabricated the story.

November 2016: As tales of Trump-inspired “hate crimes” were spread far and wide by liberal journalists after Trump’s election, one online prankster decided to test just easy it was to fool journalists. The prankster sent Mic.com writer Sarah Harvard a fictitious story in which a Native American claimed to have been harassed by an alleged Trump supporter who thought she was Mexican. Despite no evidence backing up the claim, Harvard spread the fake story, emails the prankster shared with The Daily Caller showed.

April 2017: Media outlets didn’t wait to find out who was behind a string of bomb threats targeting synagogues and Jewish schools before linking the threats to Trump. A U.S.-Israeli man was charged in April 2017 and indicted in February 2018 for the threats. A former reporter for The Intercept was also charged in March 2017 with making several copycat threats.

May 2017: A church organist was arrested after he was found responsible for spray-painting a swastika, an anti-gay slur and the words “Heil Trump” on his own church in November 2016. When the story first broke, media outlets tied the hoax to Trump’s election. “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” The Washington Post reported at the time.

May 2017: Students at St. Olaf college in Minnesota staged protests and boycotted classes after racist notes targeting black students were found around campus, earning coverage in national media outlets like The Washington Post. It later came out that a black student was responsible for the racist notes. The student carried out the hoax in order to “draw attention to concerns about the campus climate,” the university announced.

November 2017: A student at Kansas State University filed a police report in November 2017 over racist graffiti left on his car. “Go Home N***** Boy” and “Whites Only,” read the racist graffiti, which the student later admitted to writing himself.

September 2018: A New York woman was charged after police determined she fabricated a story about white teens yelling racial slurs and “Trump 2016” at her and leaving a racist note on her car.

November 2018: Several racist notes at Drake University were actually the work of one of the students who had been targeted by the notes. “The fact that the actions of the student who has admitted guilt were propelled by motives other than hate does not minimize the worry and emotional harm they caused, but should temper fears,” university president Marty Martin said afterwards.

January 2019: National media outlets pounced on a selectively edited video from the March for Life that showed Native American activist Nathan Phillips beating a drum in front of a group of boys from Covington Catholic High School. The students were branded by a slew of corporate media and many celebrities as MAGA hat-wearing racists. A longer video emerged showing the students were not the instigators.

October 2016 (bonus hoax). One week before Trump was elected, leftist media outlets ran headlines like “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump” after a black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and spray painted with the words “Vote Trump.” The Washington Post’s original coverage of the incident read in part,” Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons called the fire a ‘hateful and cowardly act,’ sparked by the incendiary rhetoric of GOP nominee Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.” But the church was set on fire by one of the church’s own congregants, who is black.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

He went sobbingly on TV to present himself, especially to the intersectionality of African-Americans and LGBT individuals (he being both), as a defenseless victim.

For whatever reason, he pointed his finger at two “violent” men whom, he complained to the police, violently attacked him one night, last month in Chicago in a racist, homophobic rant. A “hate crime” if ever you saw one!

And now, based on their accounts, it appears that Smollett may be the true wrongdoer, not them.

It appears to be a set up, presumably designed to present Smollett as a very public victim, for reasons still unknown; and who would want to speculate about the reasons given how the story has so radically turned? The result? The police un-arrested the two men and decided to re-interview the “victim” — or should we call him the accuser? Now, Smollett’s role in this mess is his own doing, but what about his lawyers? This cannot be an easy time for them.

After there was considerable public speculation that Smollett’s account was false, Smollett’s lawyers made a supportively public statement sticking to his original “victim” account, and maintaining that the accusations of a false report by him were just false. In other words, Smollett’s lawyers backed his story.

Surely, a zealous lawyer is ethically entitled to believe and act on his client’s account by making a public statement on the client’s behalf even in the face of compelling evidence against it. And counsel may also rely on his client’s account to him even if he himself doesn’t really believe it. Of course, the wisdom, strategically, of making a public statement supporting the client’s account after the worm has turned so publicly and unfavorably is another story. A lawyer’s duty is to at least try to talk the client out of doing something stupid.

But what’s a lawyer to do when the evidence is piling up and the police want to re-interview the client? Yes, the trusting lawyer can bring the client for the interview even if he doesn’t believe the client, as long as the client has consistently denied to him the scam. But any competent lawyer would know that an interview will likely make the situation worse for the client. The police will simply have far more information – not to mention the accounts of the two alleged “confederates” — than when, at intake, the client presented himself as a handkerchief-toting, sympathetic victim adorned with bruises occasioned by the alleged assault.

Now, some lawyers will ask the client to take a “private,” privileged lie detector examination given confidentially by a polygraph expert retained by counsel. If the result is favorable, they will tell and give the exonerating results to the police. If bad, the result will, appropriately and consistent with the attorney-privilege, never see the light of day.

But short of a favorable polygraph, “bringing the client in” would likely be a dreadful mistake. Yes, there will be a price to be paid for declining a police re-interview or refusing to testify before a grand jury if such a request eventuates. The public will invariably learn of such a declination from a leak – especially when the police believe they’ve been hosed. But if Smollett is ultimately charged, to have engaged in a second series of lies will only have made the situation worse.

And that’s really where the lawyer’s obligations and strengths come into play. Telling a client — even a client who wants to stick to his increasingly bizarre story for those who continue to be his wide-eyed public (despite mounting evidence against him) — that he needs to stand down may be the hardest job a lawyer will face. That will be the test of how good the lawyers really are. This especially when a refusal to be re-interviewed is, it appears, likely to lead to Smollett’s potential arrest — no judgment intended — for having made a false report, at a time when such false reports sorely undermine serious hate crime complaints by others made in good faith. (By the way, it seems that Smollett may have new lawyers, and it’s not hard to imagine why).

Indeed, it seems, the only worthwhile reason to bring the client to the police for a re-interview is if the client — willing to bite the bullet, after having acknowledged to his lawyers the fact of his false complaint – recognizes that a remorseful admission to the police (and to the public at large) will be the path of least resistance, and the path resulting in the least amount of pain for him going forward. A hard job indeed for the lawyer, and a place where he really earns his keep (once he really knows what happened).

A department spokesman told The Associated Press on Tuesday that a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the Empire star with the two brothers later arrested and released from custody.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police haven't confirmed the person's account and that detectives planned to interview that person on Tuesday.

Last week, police announced the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers, who were released from police custody without charges. Police also said they requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's legal team continues to maintain that Smollett was a victim in the alleged attack, as well as in the reports that he may have played a role in staging it.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

A spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.""

In January, Smollett claimed that two masked men bombarded him with racial and homophobic slurs, beat him, poured an unknown substance on him that may have been bleach and tied a rope around his neck. However, law enforcement sources told Chicago news outlets the brothers told detectives Smollett paid them $3,500 to participate in the attack before they went to Nigeria the day of the alleged incident and were promised $500 when they returned to Chicago. They reportedly said they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before it happened and bought the rope found around Smollett's neck.

Police asked Smollett for a new interview, but he is refusing to do so.

Meanwhile Empire showrunner and executive Brett Mahoney threw his support behind Smollett on Sunday.

""I believe and stand by [Jussie Smollett],"" Mahoney tweeted. ""Keep your head up."" The message was also retweeted by the Empire writers room Twitter page.

FOX denied rumors that Smollett was going to be written off the musical drama, with series co-creator Danny Strong tweeting last week, ""There is 0 percent truth that [Smollett] was going to be written off of Empire. ""This rumor is totally false. He is the third lead and one of the most beloved characters on the show. Writing him off the show has NEVER even been discussed."""

Police want to ask Smollett additional questions about the attack he reported on January 29, but as of Tuesday morning, Smollett's attorneys had not indicated when their client will be available to talk to police. Smollett told authorities that two men attacked him, putting a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

Two brothers, who were arrested and released in connection with the attack, met with police and prosecutors at a Chicago courthouse on Tuesday, Chicago police spokesman Tom Ahern said. The county's top prosecutor, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, has recused herself from the investigation, according to a spokeswoman from her office.

The 2 brothers in the Jussie #Smollett case met with police and prosecutors at the criminal court bldg. today, they did not testify before a grand jury. #ChicagoPolice

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" said the spokeswoman, Tandra Simonton.

The men -- who attorney Gloria Schmidt identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo -- were arrested February 13 but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ""new evidence."" The two are no longer suspects at this time, Chicago police have said.

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM, the men said: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

On Monday, Anne Kavanaugh with Media Pros 24/7, a firm representing Smollett, released a statement saying in part, ""Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.""

Smollett charged with providing false information to law enforcement in 2007 misdemeanor case

More than a decade ago, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case, according to Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

The case stems from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police the wrong name.

Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver license.

He was sentenced to two years of probation and paid a fine, according to Mateljan.

Police looking into whether Smollett paid the brothers

Abimbola ""Abel"" Osundairo was arrested then released without being charged.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement and that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo also was released without being charged.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama ""Empire.""

Letter addressed to Smollett before alleged attack included the word 'MAGA""

Seven days before the alleged attack, a letter containing white powder was sent to the Chicago set of ""Empire,"" Chicago police have said. Authorities determined the powder to be aspirin, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

The image of the letter and envelope, shared with CNN by a person close to Smollett, includes a message apparently cut from magazine clippings, and a stick figure drawing. Smollett told ABC News the drawing was of a ""stick figure hanging from a tree which had a gun pointing towards it."" The letter, addressed to Smollett, includes the word ""MAGA"" on the outside of the envelope in place of the return address.

What happened

According to to Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled ""'Empire' fa***t"" and ""'Empire' n***er'"" while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

The brothers said in a statement they are not racist or homophobic.

Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as ""potential suspects"" then. But by Friday night they had been released , Guglielmi said.

One of the men has appeared on ""Empire,"" Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Smollett has expressed frustration about not being believed

Smollett gave his first detailed account last week of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in the interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted ""this is MAGA country"" before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

""I never said that,"" he told ABC's Robin Roberts. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae."""

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”"

So now, the 30-year-old wants African American girls to love their luscious locs as much as she does now and created a line of dolls with afros as an ode to inspire Black girls to foster a love for their curly crowns, The Daily Mail reports.

“I struggled with my self-esteem and confidence as a child,” said Pyrame who grew up in Haiti but moved to Boston in 2002.

“I thought I wasn’t beautiful enough because of my dark skin and hair texture, which led me to want straight hair so badly — just like they did in the magazines — so I looked more like the dolls, with sleek locks.

“I used my mother’s products all over my hair, hoping that it would be silky smooth. Instead it all fell out, and she was furious!”

It takes a village and it was Pyrame’s uncle who bought her and her sister Youselord a Black doll to share that helped her realize the beauty that was within herself.

She added: “One day my uncle got us a Black doll to share. We were so shocked to see that one existed that we just stared at her in amazement.”

That gift left an indelible impression on Pyrame who dedicated during her years of training as a social worker that she wanted to create a range of dolls that would combat the negative images perpetrated toward Black girls.

“When children are playing, they want to see something that represents themselves,” she said. “I believe little girls seeing dolls that look just like them would help with the pressure of skin bleaching – which involves using a cosmetic cream or procedure to lighten the skin – and the pressure to change their hair texture.

“Many children, from India to the Dominican Republic, see darker skin as negative. We need more diversity and awareness in our early years to know that there’s nothing wrong with different skin tones,” she said.

And already Pyrame has seen the fruits of her labor through the approval of her niece who she says loves the dolls she created.

“Her eyes light up when I give her one of her own, it’s magical. It reminds me that we must love our uniqueness,” she said.

The dolls, created with Pyrame’s Haitian background in mind, are outfitted in clothing with African and Haitian cultural designs created by seamstresses in Florida. They sell online for $30 on average.

“I currently have four different dolls on offer. The first is Kenara, a Haitian girl who is all about celebrating the national flag and heritage,” she explained about her work. “Malikalia is an African doll, whose name means angel. Adelaida is a biracial girl who represents the different backgrounds black girls come from, and Nevah is another Haitian doll who loves celebrating Haitian independence day on January 1 as it was the first black country to gain independence.”

Pyrame hopes her dolls have as much of a powerful impact with young girls as a Black doll once had with her.

Editor's Note 2/22/19: Since this article was published Smollet has turned himself in and was charged with a felony for ""falsely claiming to be the victim of a hate crime.""

After allegedly being attacked last month by two men who yelled “this is MAGA country,” investigators have obtained new information to suggest that “Empire” star Jussie Smollett staged his attack.

According to ABC News, Smollett – an openly gay, African American actor – was allegedly attacked in Chicago by two men who yelled derogatory slurs at him as they wrapped a noose around his neck and covered him in bleach.

Police arrested two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundario, in relation to the attack and according to CBS 2, the men – who were deemed main suspects – were released within days without charges.

Reportedly, the brothers provided police with information that “shifted the trajectory” of the case.

According to a source for CBS 2, the brothers revealed to police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to attack him. The source told CBS 2 that the brothers, one of whom CBS News reports is Smollett’s personal trainer, were able to confirm certain details of the attack and offer some possible insight on other parts of the assault. Reportedly, one brother wrapped the rope around Smollett’s neck as he poured bleach on him while the other brother – adorn with a plain red baseball hat – yelled homophobic and racist slurs at the Empire star.

The source also said that the brothers told police detectives that they rehearsed the attack with Smollett days prior to it actually happening.

Police have not publicly confirmed that these statements are true, but they have requested a second interview with Smollett and have released the two men arrested for the attack, without charges.

While evidence appears to be mounting against him, Smollett is continuing to unequivocally deny the allegations that he staged the attack.

Cardi's post came after this weekend's reports that Smollett may have paid two men that he knew to stage the alleged attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt. "" Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s--t was staged, I don't want to completely blame him because ... police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar,” she said.

Smollett has denied that the attack was orchestrated — personally on ""Good Morning America"" — and also via his attorneys.

In an Instagram Live video on Monday, Cardi B said that she is ""really disappointed"" in Jussie Smollett.

""I'm really disappointed in Jussie Smollett,” Cardi B said in a Monday Instagram video. ""I feel like he f---ed up Black History Month, bro.""

The video, which no longer appears on the app, can be viewed on Pop Crave's Twitter account.

Cardi's post comes as police continue to investigate whether Smollett himself was involved in staging a late January assault to make it appear to be a racist and homophobic hate crime, as CNN reported Saturday. Sources told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett may have paid two men to stage the attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt.

""Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s--t was staged, I don't want to completely blame him because ... police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar,” she said.

The ""Empire"" star said that on January 29, two attackers put a noose around his neck, chanted pro-Trump slogans, poured bleach on him, and used racist and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police released the two Nigerian brothers arrested in connection to the alleged attack late Friday evening after questioning them. TMZ reports the brothers in question are Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who both reportedly worked on the set of ""Empire.""

Both Smollett and his attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, have pushed back on reports that the alleged attack was orchestrated.

Smollett's attorneys released a statement Saturday night, saying Smollett was being ""further victimized"" by accusations that he planned the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.""

The co-hosts lamented the damage this would do for actual victims of hate crimes, and Sunny Hostin even admitted that she was embarrassed for believing Smollett and coming out in support for him, initially.

Guest co-host Ana Navarro, filling in for the absent Whoopi Goldberg, called the revelation “shocking and crazy” admitting that she had seen the actor at an activist event the week before the supposed attack, talking about LGBTQ rights. Like the rest of the media, Navarro expressed shock that Smollett’s tall tale of a story wasn’t actually true and fretted with the fellow co-hosts about people who did get beat up for being gay:

ANA NAVARRO: To hear this plot twist is something that is so appalling. I can't think of anything, that -- assuming it's a hoax, assuming it's true, if if if, I can't think of anything that’s more hurtful to real victims coming forward than somebody making up a story. ABBY HUNTSMAN: You know how hard this make it for people that do experience real hate crimes? And he was a spokesperson for the LGBT community...How do you recover from this? How do you recover from it?

But Joy Behar didn’t want to pass judgement. “You don't know the truth of it. You don't know the truth,” she urged. Sunny Hostin agreed that we “don’t know the truth,” but then admitted Smollett was a “friend” to The View, and she was embarrassed for believing his story and publicly condemning the attack:

Prayers up to @JussieSmollett and his family and friends. Have met him and interviewed him several times. He is an incredible person with a gentle and loving spirit. What is happening to our world? https://t.co/UqXVgU5L6O — Sunny Hostin (@sunny) January 29, 2019

“I know him. I've interviewed him several time. He's a friend to the show. I tweeted out originally my prayers for him. What is happening in our world. But now, I -- if this is true, I'm embarrassed to have believed him, to have supported him,” she gushed.

Abby Huntsman tried to console her. “You and many others, though,” she empathized.

Hostin continued, ranting that fake claims are rarely made and that she hoped Smollett simply got “counseling” (instead of jail time?):

I'm disgusted. I spent my entire career trying to protect victims and false reports are generally very low. Somewhere between 2% and 10%. So now how difficult is it going to be for the victim of a sex crime, of a hate crime, to come forward? It's always very difficult for them because they feel they won't be believed. I really hope that if this is true, that he gets counseling. Because, think about Chicago, you know how difficult it is for the police department there to investigate? They're way underfunded.

Meghan McCain agreed that the Chicago police could’ve been spending their resources investigating murders and actual crimes in the past month. She added,” I also believe he is a sociopath if this ends up being the case.” Hostin seemed to backtrack slightly, adding, “We don't know [the truth] because the investigation is ongoing.”

Abby Huntsman ended the segment by slamming politicians who were quick to judge Smollett’s story, but didn’t mention that only Democrats had done this."

The New York Postreports the actor, who plays gay singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on the show, was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical performance in the second-to-last episode of Season 5, but five scenes and the musical number have now been axed.

Smollett’s character is also no longer the focus of his remaining four scenes, which will now feature an ensemble of characters.

The 36-year-old actor is spending far less time on set as a result. He’ll be working Friday and possibly Thursday but won’t be rehearsing.

Empire scriptwriters have been scrambling over the last 24 hours to revise this season’s scripts.

Smollett claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack near his Chicago apartment January 29, but suspicion has since emerged that he paid two friends to help stage the assault.

There’s a 50/50 chance that a grand jury will begin weighing an indictment as early as next Tuesday, TMZ said. Smollett could be charged with felony filing a false police report.

Rapper Cardi B weighed in on the controversy on Wednesday, saying if Smollett did stage the attack he has ruined Black History Month, which runs for the entire month every February.

“I am really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*** his name is. I’m really disappointed in him,” she said in a live Instagram video.

“I feel like he f***d up Black History Month bro. Like damn. I’m not going to say yet until he said out his mouth at it was fake and staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because you know like somebody, that I was talking to, they said that police in Chicago are racist so they might try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar, but if he’s not then bro you f**ed up for real.”

With a scandal flaring up around “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was a victim of a hate crime, the Fox drama series has cut some scenes featuring the actor, TMZ reports. The report comes as momentum appears to be building for the sentiment that Smollett staged the Jan. 29 attack in Chicago.

“Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d,” TMZ reports. “As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.”

The report notes that Smollett’s time on the set is also being cut back.

“Instead of working every day this week, we’re told Jussie’s working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing,” TMZ reports, adding: “Less work for Jussie means more work for writers, who are busy making edits. In the past 24 hours, we’re told the script has undergone multiple revisions.”

The case is said to be headed to a grand jury, possibly as early as today. TMZ cites law enforcement sources saying the focus is on “presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Jussie for allegedly filing a false police report.”"

In recent weeks, the case was unsealed to the public, and the Chicago police department issued a new statement on details from their investigation. There were also rumors that Smollett would be returning to Empire for its final season, but those rumors were later squashed. Scroll down for a time line of the case from day one all they way through to the most recent news.

Slide 1 of 14 Alleged Victim (Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Images for The Trevor Project) Jussie Smollet is a 36-year-old actor, who is currently most well-known for his role as Jamal Lyon on Fox's Empire. He has earned three award nominations from his time on the series. Prior to Empire, Smollett was a child actor who appeared in a number of films and TV series such as The Mighty Ducks, North and On Our Own. He is the older brother to actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell, who was on Full House as a child and will be appearing as Black Canary in the upcoming Birds of Prey movie.

Slide 2 of 14 The Attack (Photo: Instagram / Lee Daniels) On Jan. 29, Smollett alleged that he was attacked outside of an apartment building by two white men who beat him because he is gay and black. He stated to police that they yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" while assaulting him, pouring a liquid believed to be bleach on him, and putting a noose around his neck. Smollett claimed to have fought the men off and called for help, who arrived to find him still with the rope around his neck. He was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to have his injuries treated but was released after it was determined that he had not suffered any serious wounds.

Slide 3 of 14 Smollett's Statement (Photo: Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images) Following the attack, Smollett broke his silence by providing a statement to Essence magazine. ""Let me start by saying that I’m O.K. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words,"" the statement began. “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" Smollett continued. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me,"" he added. ""With Love, respect & honor... Jussie,"" the statement concluded.

Slide 4 of 14 Persons of Interest (Photo: @monster_in_the_flesh / Instagram) Police reviewed surveillance footage from the area where the alleged attack took place and discovered individuals they believed to be persons of interest. Eventually, authorities were able to identify the men and brought them in for questioning. They were released without charges. The two men are brothers named Abel and Ola Osundairo, and they are of Nigerian descent. It was later alleged that Smollett and the brothers were seen in his apartment building elevator together on the night of the alleged attack.

Slide 5 of 14 Hoax Allegations (Photo: Theo Wargo/Getty Images) During their interview with police, the Osundairo brothers claimed that they had not assaulted Smollett but rather he paid them to be involved. Police later confirmed that they had evidence to suggest he paid the men $3,500 to help him carry out the hoax, in the form of the actual check he wrote to them. In a statement, the Osundairo brothers said, ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Slide 6 of 14 Smollett's Response (Photo: Getty Images) The actor's attorneys released a statement in regard to the hoax allegations, saying on hs behalf, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" Following the new developments, it was reported that police wanted to speak with Smollett again. He reportedly refused, issuing a statement though his PR rep, Anne Kavanagh. “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today,” Kavanagh's statement read.

Slide 7 of 14 Charged with Felony Disorderly Conduct and Arrested (Photo: Chicago Police Department) On Feb. 20 Smollett was officially charged with felony disorderly conduct after police determined that he filed a false police report regarding the assault. The following day, the Empire actor turned himself in to police. During a press conference, Chicago P.D. officials advised that Smollett would have a bond hearing later in the day. At the hearing, Smollet was given a $100,000 bond and ordered to surrender his passport.

Slide 8 of 14 Motive (Photo: Chuck Hodes/FOX) During their press conference, Chicago police also offered a motive for Smollett's faked assault. They claimed that he did it because he was not satisfied with his Empire salary. While they did not offer much more info than that at the time, the implication seems to be that he intended to gain more public notoriety and use it to leverage for a bigger payday.

Slide 9 of 14 Dropped from 'Empire' (Photo: Fox) After bonding out of jail, Smollett returned to the set of Empire where sources told TMZ that he apologized to the cast and crew for what has happened. ""I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this,” he said. Producers eventually revealed that Smollett had been dropped from the remainder of the most recent season. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" a joint statement from the producers read. ""Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out."" ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement added. More recently, it was reported that Smollett had been fully let go from Empire, with creator Lee Daniels stating the actor will not be appearing in the upcoming final season.

Slide 10 of 14 Indicted on 16 Felony Counts (Photo: Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images) On March 8 it was announced that Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts of lying to the police about the assault. According to CBS News in Chicago, the allegations are specifically referred to as “false report of offense"" and are Class 4 felonies. “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time … there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed,” the indictment read in part.

Slide 11 of 14 ""Not Guilty"" Plea (Photo: Getty) On March 14, Smollett appeared in court again to be arraigned on the charges he faces. The actor pleaded ""not guilty."" While he awaited his next court date, he was expected to stay in Chicago, but was allowed to travel to Los Angeles and New York to meet with his lawyers as long as he gave sufficient notice to authorities ahead of time.

Slide 12 of 14 Charges Dropped, Case Dismissed (Photo: Patrick Hoelck/FOX) On March 26, the prosecution in Smollett's case announced that they had reached a plea deal with the actor, where in he would surrender his $10,000 bond and agree to do community service. In exchange, all charges were dropped and the case against him was dismissed. ""Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him. Jussie was attacked by 2 people he was unable to identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgment,"" Smollett's attorneys said in a statement. ""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that a victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result,"" the statement added.

Slide 13 of 14 911 Call Released (Photo: Shareif Ziyadat/Getty Images) After about five months after the alleged assault, the call that Smollett's friend placed to 911 was finally released. In audio shared by TMZ, the unidentified caller of could be heard telling the 911 operator that the ""attackers"" wrapped ""a noose around"" Smollett's neck. The caller is also heard saying that the Empire actor did not want to file a police report, but the friend was going to make him because the incident was ""really f—ed up."""

On his way back, he was accosted by two men wearing red hats who called him the f-word and the n-word.

On Sunday, Milano took to Twitter to voice her amazement that Smollett’s dubious account of the hate crime was potentially bogus.

“If that man staged his own attack he is wrong in so many ways,” posted the actress. “No one could be that hurtful? To stage this? Right?”

Milano continued: “To f*** with all of us by playing into our weaknesses & make it even harder for victims to come forward?! No one could choose to be that hurtful? Right?! RIGHT?”

The “Charmed” actress was quick to jump on the story as fact on January 29, the day of the alleged attack.

“I’ve been trying to figure out all day what to say about the racist, homophobic, violence against [Jussie Smollett],” Milano posted her to her 3.5 million-plus Twitter followers. “Not sure I can describe what I’m feeling in a neat & tidy tweet. His trauma deserves more.”

“I’m sad. Living together on the planet shouldn’t be this difficult,” she added.

Smollett claims he was targeted and jumped by two white Trump supporters in downtown Chicago after leaving a Subway sandwich shop at around 2:30 a.m. The men called him a “n*****” and a “f*****” and told him this was “MAGA country,” he has claimed. The actor also says the men kicked him in the ribs, tied a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him.

New reporting, however, suggests Smollett hired two Nigerian men to stage the attack on him after a threatening “MAGA” letter he received at work did not generate enough media attention.

Milano has a habit of falling for dubious stories when they fit nicely with the anti-Trump, left-wing narrative.

At the end of January, predating the alleged Smollett attack, Milano fell for the fake news surrounding Catholic schoolboys from Covington High School leaving the March for Life in Washington, D.C. Though full video context would show that the boys, some who happened to be wearing pro-Trump “MAGA” hats (a grave sin, alas), were harassed by an activist group and approached by Native American Nathan Phillips, Milano played up the narrative that the boys were the harassers.

“The red MAGA hat is the new white hood,” she wrote on Twitter. “Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself. #FirstThoughtsWhenIWakeUp.”

The red MAGA hat is the new white hood. Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself. #FirstThoughtsWhenIWakeUp — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 20, 2019

Moreover, even after she was proven wrong, Milano doubled-down on her harsh language targeted at children. In an op-ed at The Wrap, Milano wrote:

I sent out a tweet that read, “The red MAGA hat is the new white hood.” Right-wing pundits and anonymous trolls alike screamed for my head–literally and figuratively. My husband received death threats on his cell phone. Many demanded an apology. Here’s the thing: I was right. So, I won’t apologize to these boys. Or anyone who wears that hat. But I will thank them. I will thank them for lighting a fire underneath the conversation about systemic racism and misogyny in this country and the role President Donald Trump has had in cultivating it and making it acceptable.

In mature fashion, she concluded the post: “Sorry not sorry.”"

Many different sorts of crimes are motivated by hatred. You could argue that hatred of some form or another probably plays a role in most crime. The courts have put themselves in the position of reading a criminal’s mind, peeking into his soul, and then arbitrarily distinguishing certain types of hate from certain others, and even more arbitrarily deciding that the one type is “worse” than the other. So a crime motivated by a hatred for humanity as a whole will not qualify as a hate crime. A crime motivated by hatred for a particular person will not qualify, either. It must be hatred toward the demographic features of a particular person or group. But why should that earn more legal condemnation than personal hatred or universal hatred?

Besides, the very worst crimes are often motivated not by hatred at all, but by total indifference to human life. A serial killer may not have anything against any particular racial group. He just kills for the sake of it. A guy who murders another guy for his shoes probably has little hatred in his heart. He is callous, not bigoted. But callous indifference is surely just as bad as, if not worse than, hatred. Surely, it’s just as dangerous to a community. If not more so.

And this is to say nothing of the political and ideological factors that too often help decide what will be called a hate crime. When a white man was beaten, robbed, and stripped naked by a group of black people in Baltimore a few years ago, the culprits were not prosecuted under hate crime statutes. Does anyone doubt that the results would have been different had the races been reversed?

But, all that said, as long as we have this category with its many inherent problems, we should endeavor to wield it as fairly and apolitically as possible. Equality under the law demands that all laws, even bad ones, must be applied to everyone. That’s why, if Jussie Smollett is guilty of fabricating a hate crime, he should be charged with committing one. To fake a hate crime is to perpetrate a hate crime. That’s the way it should work.

Jussie Smollett could technically face three years in prison for filing a false police report. He could be looking at another five years if he mailed a threatening letter to himself. I doubt he’ll spend even a day in jail. People aren’t generally given hard time for making up stories, despite whatever sentencing the law technically allows. But people are given hard time for hate crimes, and that should be the charge against Smollett. It isn’t just a false report, it’s a bias crime against white conservatives as a whole.

The FBI defines “hate crime” this way: “A criminal offense committed against a person, property, or society that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin.”

Smollett’s offense was indeed committed against a “society,” or a group, with the objective of engendering outrage and suspicion toward that group. In fact, his hatred of whites was so great that he was prepared to let two random white people take the fall for the hoax — until he found out that the persons of interest picked up by cops were his Nigerian buddies. This is a man whose bigotry constitutes a threat to civilized society. Let him face the consequences that he would have happily allowed innocent white men to face. Prosecute him and maybe the next hate crime hoaxer will think twice."

More information has come out about actor-singer Jussie Smollett's alleged hate crime attack.

On Monday, Feb. 18, 2019, Chicago's CBS 2 revealed a possible motive amid ongoing speculation that the Empire star, who plays Jamal Lyon on the hit FOX series, may have orchestrated the incident after receiving a racist, homophobic letter at the network's Cinespace Studios late last month.

According to a source cited by the news outlet, ""When the letter didn't get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack."" The insider went on to claim that Smollett was reportedly dismayed after the letter didn't receive a ""bigger reaction.""

The letter in question, which was received on Jan. 22, 2019, reportedly included a drawing of a gun pointed at a stick figure hanging from a tree, as well as a white powdery substance, which turned out to be crushed up aspirin. In addition to President Donald Trump's ""MAGA"" slogan written on the envelope, the contents of the message itself included letters cut out from a magazine, which read, ""You will die black f*g.""

According to Page Six, the FBI has since taken over the investigation into the letter from the Chicago Police Department.

As Nicki Swift previously reported, Smollett, 36, was allegedly attacked by two men in Chicago, Ill. in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2019. The men in question reportedly used racist and homophobic hate speech while physically assaulting the TV star, pouring a chemical believed to be bleach on him, and placing a noose around his neck. While leaving the scene, they allegedly said, ""This is MAGA country."" After Smollett sought medical treatment at Northwestern Memorial, authorities in the Windy City reportedly began its investigation into the incident as a possible hate crime.

For his part, Smollett broke his silence on the matter in a statement to Essence on Feb. 1. ""Let me start by saying that I'm OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger,"" he wrote in part at the time. After thanking his supporters for their ""outpouring of love and support,"" Smollett noted that he'd been ""100% factual and consistent"" while working with the police.

Sharing his belief that ""justice will be served"" following the ""horrific incident,"" he concluded, ""Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It's all I know. And that can't be kicked out of me.""

Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were later taken into police custody on Feb. 13 as potential suspects in the case, according to CBS Chicago. However, new evidence uncovered during their interrogations led authorities to switch gears amid the investigation over the weekend — prompting reports of a hoax and subsequent backlash online.

According to the news outlet, the Osundairo brothers, who have since been released without charges, reportedly told the Chicago PD that Smollett paid them $3,500 to help stage the assault. They also reportedly claimed that the three rehearsed together prior to the incident (via TMZ). Furthermore, upon the brothers' return from a recent trip to Nigeria, they were allegedly ""promised an additional $500"" from Smollett, according to CBS 2.

""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,"" Ola and Abel Osundairo released in a joint statement to CBS Chicago on Monday, Feb. 18. ""We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Smollett denied these claims in a statement released to CNN through his lawyers on Saturday, Feb. 16. ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his attorneys' statement read in part. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

It should be noted that, at the time of this writing, the Chicago PD has yet to publicly confirm nor deny this ongoing speculation of a staged attack amid its ongoing investigation.

In related news, Smollett's role on an upcoming episode of Empire has reportedly been cut down significantly amid these rumors, as reported by TMZ. According to production sources cited by the gossip rag on Tuesday, Feb. 19, a number of the actor's scenes in an episode that's currently being filmed, as well as the ""big musical number"" he was meant to shoot, have allegedly been written out of the script altogether. However, Smollett will reportedly return to set later this week to film a handful of ensemble scenes sans rehearsal."

Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d. As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members. With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we’re told Jussie’s working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

That Smollett may not be completely wiped from the show is no surprise, as Empire executive producer Brett Mahoney took to Twitter on Sunday to essentially side with Smollett, saying he believes and stands by him despite proof that Smollett has been lying all along.

Keep in mind that this is the same Smollett who agreed to press charges on two innocent men before finding out that they were the two Nigerian brothers he hired to attack him. The same Smollett who lead an all-too-willing press on a malicious maligning campaign against Trump supporters.

This man will reportedly not be wiped from the television show that was gearing up to get rid of him completely.

Perhaps they’re slowly writing him off in order to save the writers too much work, but looking at incidents like that of Kevin Spacey — who apparently went too far, even for the left — that Smollett wasn’t just eliminated off screen is surprising, given the backlash he’s currently getting from the world.

Or perhaps not so surprising, given Smollett did, after all, attempt to target the right kind of people.

I mean hey, “at least he started a conversation.”

My eyes can’t roll hard enough."

In a live video on Instagram posted Monday, Cardi B said that she is “really disappointed” in Jussie Smollett.

Cardi’s post came after this weekend’s reports that Smollett may have paid two men that he knew to stage the alleged attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt. “Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s–t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because … police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar,” she said.

Smollett has denied that the attack was orchestrated – personally on “Good Morning America” – and also via his attorneys.

In an Instagram Live video on Monday, Cardi B said that she is “really disappointed” in Jussie Smollett.

“I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett,” Cardi B said in a Monday Instagram video. “I feel like he f—ed up Black History Month, bro.”

The video, which no longer appears on the app, can be viewed on Pop Crave’s Twitter account.

Cardi’s post comes as police continue to investigate whether Smollett himself was involved in staging a late January assault to make it appear to be a racist and homophobic hate crime, as CNN reported Saturday. Sources told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett may have paid two men to stage the attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt.

“Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s–t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because … police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar,” she said.

The “Empire” star said that on January 29, two attackers put a noose around his neck, chanted pro-Trump slogans, poured bleach on him, and used racist and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police released the two Nigerian brothers arrested in connection to the alleged attack late Friday evening after questioning them. TMZ reports the brothers in question are Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who both reportedly worked on the set of “Empire.”

Both Smollett and his attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, have pushed back on reports that the alleged attack was orchestrated.

Smollett’s attorneys released a statement Saturday night, saying Smollett was being “further victimized” by accusations that he planned the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

On Wednesday, he appeared on “Good Morning America,” saying he was hurt by those who doubted his allegations.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth – you don’t even want to see the truth,” he said.

JUNIOR’S NASTY LOSING GAMBIT Donald Trump Jr. has been saying nasty things about public school teachers.

A response by PBS: “Editor’s note: President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Jr., addressed his father’s campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night, instructing young conservatives ‘to keep up that fight, bring it to your schools. You don’t have to be indoctrinated by these loser teachers that are trying to sell you on socialism from birth.’ His remarks prompted many responses by teachers on social media. Kristin Karnitz is not a teacher (she is a customer service account manager and mother from De Pere, Wisconsin). But, counting many educators in her family, she penned an op-ed in defense of the profession, an edited version of which appears below. “I come from a long line of loser teachers. I am the granddaughter of a loserteacher. The niece of loser teachers. The cousin of loser teachers. The sister of a loser teacher. The friend of many loser teachers. Once upon a time, I wanted to be a loser teacher too. But when I approached that point in my college life to choose that track, I bailed. I wasn’t strong enough. I wasn’t selfless enough.”

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) Associated Press

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police last month that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs.

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

- Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an ""unknown substance"" on him. Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

- Chicago police say they've reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them ""persons of interest.""

- Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

- Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett and that, ""It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.""

- Smollett's family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett's family says he ""has told the police everything"" and ""his story has never changed,"" disputing assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

- Smollett issues a statement telling people that he is OK and thanking them for their support. He says he is working with authorities and has been ""100 percent factual and consistent on every level.""

Feb. 2

- Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California , opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

- Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren't sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

- Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on ""Empire."" They question them about the case. Police also search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

- Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

- Producers of ""Empire"" dispute media reports that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

- Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two ""persons of interest"" are now considered suspects. He says the men - identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria - are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

- Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

- Police say the investigation has ""shifted"" after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they've requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett's lawyers say the actor feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault.

- Smollett's account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

- Chicago police say they're still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that ""shifted"" their investigation of a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett's attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

- Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. ""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he says.

Feb. 19

- Chicago police say they're investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it's not credible based on video evidence.

Citing ""production sources,"" the outlet said Smollett had been slated for nine scenes and a musical number in the second-to-last episode of the season, now being shot, but that five of those scenes as well as his spotlight performance are no more — which has sent writers into overdrive rewriting the script.

TMZ added that Smollett — who's openly gay and plays a gay character on ""Empire"" — is no longer the focus of his four remaining scenes and that he's merely part of an ensemble in them. In addition, the outlet said, he's not working every day this week — just Friday and possibly Thursday — and won't be rehearsing.

What did the studio say?



TheBlaze on Tuesday asked Fox — which airs ""Empire"" — to comment on the TMZ story, but a representative balked: ""We are not commenting on this report. Our statement of last Thursday stands.""



Presumably ""our statement"" refers to the studio's response last week amid reports Smollett was being written off the show. ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the statement said.

""Empire"" executive producer Brett Mahoney also stood behind Smollett as recently as Sunday night, a day after law enforcement sources said the Nigerian brothers arrested and later released in the alleged attack admitted Smollett paid them to do it.

In the meantime, a civil rights activist said Smollett should be arrested and prosecuted while Democratic senators like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris — so outraged over the incident when it was first reported and seemingly sure it occurred as claimed — suddenly refrained from rushing to judgment about Smollett in the last few days over hoax chatter surrounding him.

Smollett claimed he was jumped at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 on a Chicago street in near-zero temperatures by two men wearing ski masks who put a rope around his neck, poured a liquid on him that smelled like bleach, and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, along with saying he was in ""MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again."" No video of the alleged attack has surfaced despite Chicago boasting a high number of cameras on its streets.

He was set to appear in nine scenes. However, five of them — along with a big musical number — have now reportedly been axed.

This comes in the wake of mounting suspicion by both the public and authorities that the January 29 attack on the actor/singer may have been staged. The case is heading to a Grand Jury and (according to TMZ sources), the prosecution is set to present evidence which could result in a felony indictment for allegedly filing a false police report.

Smollett has vehemently denied staging the attack, as articulated via a statement released by lawyers on his behalf.

Empire season 5 is currently in production in Chicago, but much of the show is being overshadowed by one of its stars in Jussie Smollett. The actor has been at the center of headlines ever since an incident earlier this year when he was reportedly attacked and was subject to a series of offensive remarks. Controversy has since lingered on this story, mostly due to new allegations that the entire attack was orchestrated and planned.

According to a report from Deadline, the allegations and story at large are having a tremendous impact on the series as a whole. While Smollett still remains a cast member on the series as of this writing, the writers are trimming Smollett’s number of scenes amidst the larger investigation. Meanwhile, they are not editing or changing any sequences that have already been filmed. The Chicago Police Department is looking to further question the actor about his role in the incident, including claims that he worked with two men to plan out the attack and the media aftermath of it.

In a statement, Smollett’s attorney strongly denied the allegations that he had any sort of active role in the incident:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The long-term future of Jussie on Empire is going to be likely determined by the end result of this investigation, and it’s hard to speculate too much on that one way or another. So far, most of his Empire cast members have been public in their support of him, but many within the entertainment industry have since taken a wait-and-see approach when it comes to the end result of the investigation. There could be more information that comes out this week, but this is also not something that should necessarily be rushed. The most important thing that comes out of this investigation is that the results are wholly accurate.

Empire season 5 will return with new episodes a little bit later this spring. If you are interested in reading some more news, you can do so over at the link here.

Fox also expressed support for the actor who portrays gay singer Jamal Lyon on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series.

Brothers implicated in attack on Jussie Smollett tell police the ‘Empire’ actor was upset that earlier threatening letter didn’t get enough attention. @EvaPilgrim has an update on the story. https://t.co/jrfwdzsmgd pic.twitter.com/SCKcoIchBr — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 19, 2019

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” said 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment on February 14. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” Fox added.

As Chicago cops seek more information from the two Nigerian brothers who are being questioned to determine what role, if any, Smollett played in his own attack, the actor’s defense lawyers issued a statement on Saturday that their client “has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.” They added, “nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Speaking on “Good Morning America” on February 14 in his first interview since the incident, Smollett said he thought the attack occurred because of his criticism of Donald Trump.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” the actor told GMA co-host Robin Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Meanwhile, Mahoney has remained consistent in his support of Smollett since news of the attack first broke.

“Jussie is a proud, gay black man, and I’m not sure if the cowards were trying to beat the pride, gay or black out of him but he’s strong and we’re happy he’s back at work,” Mahoney said onstage during part of Fox’s TCA presentation on February 6.

“Empire” is set to return for the second half of its fifth season on March 13, with Smollett, although his screentime is getting slashed, TMZ reports."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday afternoon that the tip was determined to be not credible after interviewing the person who made it, and that the claim was not supported by video evidence.

""CPD has confirmed that as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives,"" Guglielmi tweeted.

Smollett, 36, who is black and gay, reported to police that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two masked men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were arrested and interviewed in connection to the case last week, but were released Friday without charges and are not suspects, police have said.

After interviewing and releasing the brothers from custody last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted."" Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Another police spokesman, Tom Ahern, tweeted Tuesday that the brothers met with police and prosecutors at a criminal court building on Tuesday.

In another development Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx recused herself from the case, NBC Chicago reported. Another prosecutor in her office will handle it.

A spokesperson for Foxx's office said in an email that, ""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case.""

Attorneys for Smollett have strongly denied suggestions that the attack may have been made up or that he was complicit, and have said that the actor was the victim of a hate crime and has been cooperating with police.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement Saturday.

In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett said he was upset that some people questioned whether the attack occurred.

He said in the ABC interview that a masked attacker used a racial slur and then said ""this MAGA country,"" which is short for ""Make America Great Again,"" the slogan of President Donald Trump, followed by a racial slur and that he was punched in the face and punched back and there was a scuffle, and a second person involved kicked him.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,'"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.'""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" he said."

Some key moments in the story:

Jan. 29

— Jussie Smollett tells Chicago police he was physically attacked by two men in downtown Chicago while out getting food from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. The black and openly gay actor tells authorities the men used racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an “unknown substance” on him. Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

Jan. 30

— Chicago police say they’ve reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance camera footage, including of Smollett walking downtown, but none of the videos show the attack. Police obtain and release images of two people they would like to question, calling them “persons of interest.”

— Reports of an assault on Smollett draw outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities.

Jan. 31

— Trump tells reporters at the White House that he saw a story the night before about Smollett and that, “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

— Smollett’s family issues a statement calling the attack a racial and homophobic hate crime. Smollett’s family says he “has told the police everything” and “his story has never changed,” disputing assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

Feb. 1

— Smollett issues a statement telling people that he is OK and thanking them for their support. He says he is working with authorities and has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level.”

Feb. 2

— Smollett gives a concert in West Hollywood, California , opening with an emotional speech, saying he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Feb. 12

— Chicago police say Smollett turned over some, but not all, of the phone records detectives requested as part of their investigation. Police say the heavily redacted files aren’t sufficient. Smollett says he redacted information to protect the privacy of contacts and people not relevant to the attack.

Feb. 13

— Chicago police pick up two men they identify as Nigerian brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on their return from Nigeria after police learn at least one worked on “Empire.” They question them about the case. Police also search the apartment where the men live.

Feb. 14

— Chicago police say local media reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed .

— Producers of “Empire” dispute media reports that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, was being written off the show.

Feb. 15

— Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi says the two “persons of interest” are now considered suspects. He says the men — identified previously by police as two brothers from Nigeria — are in custody but have not been charged with a crime.

— Chicago police release the two men without charges after arresting them on suspicion of assaulting Smollett and holding them for nearly 48 hours. A police spokesman says the two are no longer considered suspects and that investigators have new evidence to consider as a result of questioning them.

Feb. 16

— Police say the investigation has “shifted” after detectives question the two brothers about the attack and release them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

— Smollett’s account of what happened is met with some skepticism on social media in the wake of the new developments.

Feb. 17

— Chicago police say they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor. Guglielimi says police reached out to Smollett’s attorney, but says an interview has not been conducted.

— Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he says.

Feb. 19

— Chicago police say they’re investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked he was in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe. Police later dismiss the tip, saying it’s not credible based on video evidence.

Smollett alleged that he was assaulted by two white men on Jan. 29 at around 2 a.m. in freezing temperatures. Two Nigerian brothers who know Smollett were recently arrested on suspicion of being the assailants but they were released after reportedly telling detectives the actor hired them to attack him.

Production sources told TMZ that Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical performance in the second-to-last episode of “Empire,” which is currently shooting.

According to the sources, that slate has been cut down to four scenes. The musical number has also been slashed.

In addition, while Smollett remains in four scenes he will no longer be the focus of those scenes and will be in an ensemble, with a number of other cast members now being introduced into the scenes.

Because of the cut in the number of scenes, Smollett is scheduled to be on set for only a day or two and he won’t be rehearsing, according to TMZ. The script for the episode underwent multiple revisions on Monday, Feb. 18, and more were expected.

Publicly, “Empire” cast members and producers have stood by Smollett or declined to comment amid mounting evidence that the alleged attack wasn’t carried out as he described.

Brett Mahoney, showrunner for the show, took to Twitter on Sunday to offer his continued support for Smollett. “I believe and stand by Jussie Smollett,” he wrote. “Keep your head up.”

On Jan. 29, Mahoney wrote that the alleged attack was “an attack on everything that is great about America.”

He added,” Keep your head up Jussie. We stand with you. Love will always conquer hate.”

Fellow cast member Taraji Henson wrote on Jan. 30: “I wish what happened to my baby was just one big bad joke but it wasn’t and we all feel his pain right now. Jussie Smollett is pure love to the bone AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY ARE FEELING HIS PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR PAIN!”

“The devil and his minions are very busy right now,” she added. She has not issued any further statements.

Lee Daniels, who created “Empire,” took to Instagram after the attack was reported to say: “It’s just another [expletive] day in America.”

“It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son. You didn’t deserve, nor anyone deserves, to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called die[expletive [expletive] or whatever they said to you,” he said.

“You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are.” A day later, he shared an update from the Chicago Police Department but in the intervening weeks he has not commented further.

Latest Developments

The Chicago Police Department said over the weekend that the Nigerian brothers were released and that information they gave detectives “changed the trajectory of the investigation.”

A spokesman said that police want to speak with Smollett again in light of the new information but wouldn’t confirm what the brothers detailed to officers.

“We are not doing any interviews or making any official statements until we can corroborate some information that was shared with police. Until we meet with the Empire cast member, we are not able to confirm, deny, or comment on any of the information that was released unofficially,” a spokesman told CBS Chicago.

“When this investigation is over, we will have a detailed accounting of the case. While we are not in a position to confirm, deny, or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete, which include additional investigation and speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

Smollett through his attorneys has denied the reports that the attack was staged and insisted he is innocent and was a victim of an attack. He admitted he knows the brothers and said he hired one of them as a personal trainer.

Smollett’s representatives told media outlets that he would not speak with the police on Monday and police officials said the actor had not informed them of any plans to submit to an interview.

The brothers spoke publicly for the first time late Monday, issuing a statement.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,” they said. “We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”"

We are currently in yet another cycle of the media and celebrity set scrambling after their hysterical fable of MAGA hat-wearing bigots becomes just another hoax. It is a revelation of how the media works in concert on particular narratives, and how the left is intent on driving the case that Trump — and the conservative right — are inherently evil and as a result diminished politically, if not as humans.

The past month we have seen a concerted effort by politicians, celebrities, and members of the media attempting to equate the red MAGA hat with Klan hoods. Wear that Make America Great Again headgear and you are defined as a racist. “Actress” Alyssa Milano is but one of the luminaries who has forwarded this particular talking point.

She sent that out just as the fiasco of a story that was the Covington High School dust-up in Washington D.C. was flaring. Once it was revealed these supposedly hateful students did not, in fact, instigate the episode meant some in the press had to backtrack. Nonetheless, Milano stood firm in her position. In an op-ed she wrote for The Wrap we see that after presented with evidence that conflicts with her belief it changed nothing.

Still, some things in that video cannot be disputed–no matter what angle or how extended the cut is. These boys, who attend a religious school, were there on a school trip protesting against a woman’s right to reproductive freedom. Several of these boys were wearing red MAGA hats, a hat that has become synonymous with white nationalism and racism.

Thus, teens attending a pro-life march can be described as racists and white nationalists…why?! Simply because they take a position of opposition to her own, and this is something we have seen repeatedly from the Left. Disagreement is tantamount to hate, and so any descriptor that illustrates this hate is apt, and proper, in their eyes. This leads the accusers down rabbit holes which eventually cave in, the result of not being fortified by facts.

The Jussie Smollett hoax and the Covington High stories have played out because swarms of people wanted to believe, and the press was operating from a de facto narrative it just knew was the case. The narrative was already implanted, they all just needed the whisper of proof. This is the toxicity of confirmation bias, where the moment they received something that appears to be evidence the reaction was to…well, they pounced.

This desire — the need — to demonize those on the right with this most hateful of accusations is not quelled in any respect with contradictory facts. That is because it does not originate from proof, but from an assumption; an emotional belief that resides inside the accuser. This condition exists in that same realm that is resistant to factual contradictions –conspiracy theories. They get just enough intel to support their feelings, and they dispatch or ignore any contradictory information.

This condition is exposed by the explanation when their supposed proof fails to hold up, “well this particular example was shown to be wrong, but we know this is a reality!” The Cliffs Notes version is the now-familiar “inaccurate, but true” canard. There is a corollary evasion when the facts dispel the charge — “Well at the least this will begin a dialogue on the subject.” That dialogue never addresses the outright lies that were told, it only gets their intended message out — and it keeps the field fertile for more of those lies.

This gives us the amazing condition of the activists and journalists on the left maintaining there is avid proof out there of Trump/MAGA racism. Yet they need to constantly source prefab examples to make their case. Look at the examples Trump has been charged with. The press declared he called immigrants “animals” when in truth he was describing violent gang members. The press had to blatantly ignore the comment came during a meeting with mayors — to address gang violence.

The immigration policy at the border has been another fiasco of forced foreign intolerance. Time after time we had been presented with policy and governmental action that was said to be indicative of President Trump’s inhumane attitude towards foreigners. As I detailed at length, repeatedly the press held up as proof examples of Trump racist policies that were in fact enforced or enacted by the prior administration. That these examples were not deemed racist prior to the 2016 election is all you need to know how this delusion is playing out.

Since the election, Trump supporters have been a constant source of falsified evidence of a toxic agenda. A Muslim woman claimed MAGA-hatters stole her hijab. Another claimed to have been mugged by Trump supporters. An arson, a church burning, a tire slashing, church vandalism, synagogue vandalism, campus graffiti, were each — and numerous other examples — blamed on Trump’s racism. All were proven to be faked examples.

What we are not permitted to point out is that, like the two most recent examples of faked reports cited as “proof”, their claims have become routinely exposed as abjectly inaccurate. In fact, noting the errors made in the press, or by others, would be perceived as a defense and therefore proof that you are a racist as well. After pointing the various inaccuracies in the Jussie Smollett myth many people were accused of being bigoted by simply asking for evidence that the attack occurred.

This is because the accusers know the proof is much harder to come by than they hoped. That term alone is disturbing enough; so many times they actually hope these hate-crimes are genuine. They wish for these instances to be real because then their inherent intolerance for the President becomes justified.

What they refuse to realize is a fundamental reality, one they steadfastly refuse to face; that being if they need to fabricate all these examples of intolerance from Trump, and his devoted followers, then that intolerance is not nearly the problem they hope for it to be.

They will choose instead to remain convinced of two assumed realities: Trump is indeed a racist, and the proof of this will arrive any day now.

The letter featured a hand-drawn stick figure being lynched while a gun is pointed at his head next to the phrase ""You will die, black fag.""

""The letter - sent on Jan. 22, is currently at the FBI crime lab for analysis,"" reports ABC.

The latest in this ever-changing story comes hours after the two brothers claimed they helped Smollett concoct the alleged assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent to the “Empire” show’s studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News on Monday. Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo have also told investigators that Smollett paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the Jan. 29 attack that he said occurred near his Chicago apartment, sources said. Detectives are actively investigating the account of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, but thus far police have not independently verified the allegations, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News. The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope — allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs — at a Chicago hardware store, sources said. -ABC News

***

Empire star Jussie Smollett's screen time has been significantly reduced by Fox in the wake of a rapidly raveling hate-crime hoax in after two brothers of Nigerian-descent reportedly told Chicago PD that Smollett paid them to stage a January 29 attack meant to frame Trump supporters as bigots.

According to TMZ, Smollett was supposed to have 9 scenes along with a ""big musical number"" in the second-to-last episode being filmed now, however five of his scenes have been cut, and he's ""no longer the focus"" in the remaining four scenes.

With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we're told Jussie's working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won't be rehearsing. Less work for Jussie means more work for writers, who are busy making edits. In the past 24 hours, we're told the script has undergone multiple revisions. -TMZ

According to BuzzFeed, the fate of Smollett's Empire character is being kept under wraps by Fox - which has so far stood by the actor.

Smollett's case is reportedly heading to a Grand Jury as early as Tuesday according to law enforcement sources, who say the focus is presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Smollett for filing a false police report.

As we reported on Monday, evidence has emerged that Smollett concocted the January 29 attack because he was upset that a racist letter sent to the Empire studio didn't get a ""bigger reaction,"" according to CBS 2 Chicago.

Smollett received a letter containing a ""white substance"" at Empire's Chicago Cinespace Studios where the show is filmed, prompting a HAZMAT response that failed to gain much traction. The ""white substance"" was later found to be aspirin.

Jussie Smollett didn't just claim he was attacked by 2 white attackers in MAGA hats who poured bleach on him and put him in a noose, he also claimed he was sent a homophobic letter containing white powder a few days before the attack. pic.twitter.com/8axvypz4kJ — Secret Asian Man (@anangbhai) February 17, 2019

As a result of the letter's failure to impress, Smollett allegedly paid two acquaintances $3,500 each to rehearse and then attack him a week later in an attempt to frame Trump supporters as violent racists.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information. The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville. -CBS 2 Chicago

CBS 2 reporter Charlie De Mar spoke on the phone with the Osundario brothers Monday afternoon, who said in a joint statement: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

While Chicago PD still wants to talk to Smollett, his crisis management team says he has no plans to do so this week."

Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

This version of the story corrects the 4th paragraph to say that last week police said reports the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed. Corrects earlier version saying that police had declined to comment on whether it was a hoax.

Additionally, Chicago Police are now saying that a tip they received about Smollett and his alleged attackers being seen together in an elevator are ""unfounded.""

CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives. — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 19, 2019

In other news related to the case, Smollett has reportedly been in contact with lawyer Mark Geragos, according to a source that spoke with Deadline.

See original story below.

According to the Associated Press, Chicago police say they received a tip that Jussie Smollett and his two alleged attackers were seen together in an elevator the night of the incident.

On Tuesday, Feb. 19, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released a statement that a person in the building where Smollett lives saw the actor and his two suspected accomplices inside an elevator the same night the Empire star claimed he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

Although the police have not confirmed the witness' account, the tip adds to the rumblings that Smollett staged the incident. Prior to this report, Empire crew members Ola and Abel Osundairo claimed they were recruited by Smollett to help orchestrate the attack. This combined with the city holding a Grand Jury hearing on whether Smollett should be charged with a felony for filing a false police report has cast doubt on the actor's story.

As a result, many are starting to distance themselves from the entertainer. Artists like rapper Cardi B have voiced their concerns about the ongoing investigation, while Empire is rumored to have downsized Smollett's storyline in the upcoming season.

Despite this, Jussie Smollett and his lawyers have maintained his innocence, stating anyone who claims Smollett falsified the attack is ""lying."""

Jussie Smollett has reportedly been cut from scenes of Fox’s “Empire” that are scheduled to be filmed in Chicago this week, according to Deadline and TMZ.

The actor will not be cut entirely from the show, a representative for 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment told INSIDER.

Smollett has alleged that he was assaulted by two men in a racist and homophobic attack in late January.

On Saturday, sources from the Chicago police investigation said that they had reason to believe that Smollett may have paid the men to stage the assault, CNN reported.

Smollett has denied the claims that he orchestrated the attack.

Filming of “Empire” will continue this week, but according to Deadline and TMZ, multiple scenes featuring actor Jussie Smollett have been cut from production.

Smollett has been cut from five of nine scenes as well as a musical number, sources told TMZ. The Fox hit is currently filming in Chicago.

The actor will not be cut entirely from the show, a representative for the network told INSIDER.

“Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show,” a spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment told INSIDER.

This news comes as police continue to investigate whether Smollett himself was involved in staging a late January assault to make it appear to be a racist and homophobic hate crime, as CNN reported Saturday. Sources told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett may have paid two men to stage the attack.

At the time, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told INSIDER that investigators had requested another interview with Smollett after the emergence of the new information.

“There are some developments in the investigation, and we are now interested in speaking to the ‘Empire’ cast member again,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett’s lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, denied reports that Smollett orchestrated the attack.

The 36-year-old actor said that on January 29, the attackers put a noose around his neck, chanted Trump slogans, poured bleach on him, and used racist and homophobic slurs.

Smollett’s attorneys released a statement Saturday night, saying Smollett was being “further victimized” by accusations that he orchestrated the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Pugh and Henderson said. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

A “hate crime” is defined as a bias crime, a crime committed against others based on who they are, or what they look like, or what group they hail from.

Filing a false police report is a crime, one that Smollett is almost certainly guilty of and might be charged with. The hate-bias part is even easier to prove. And Smollett is not the only one guilty of this. So too are his co-conspirators in the establishment media.

According to various reports, this was a meticulously planned hoax. Smollett, who is black and gay, hired to two men (who are also black) to disguise themselves as Trump supporters and beat him up on the street.

The detailed planning involved the apparent purchase of bleach, rope, red baseball caps, face masks, rehearsals, and the staging of the fake crime near a surveillance camera (that was thankfully pointing the wrong way).

The police were lied to, told about the red hats (that look like the president’s iconic MAGA hats), told the perpetrators targeted Smollett personally, told they hurled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on Smollett’s black skin, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned that “This is MAGA country!”

Obviously, the whole idea was to use this hoax as a means to single out Trump supporters, to frame, defame, smear, and denigrate a group of people — to commit a crime against them, if not a crime-crime, then a public relations crime that we would all be forced to answer for.

On top of his craven, bottomless, grasping, pathetic, neurotic need for publicity, what other motive could there possibly be? There are all kinds of ways to gin up publicity for yourself — legal and illegal, but Smollett chose this way, chose to play with the kind of fire that not only could have resulted in violence against Trump supporters out of someone’s misguided sense of retribution, but a full-fledged riot.

The establishment media are also guilty of committing this hate crime, and that they so eagerly participated in this just days after committing a similar hate crime against the boys of Covington Catholic High School, is just one more reminder that the media are indeed the enemy of the people.

The Smollett hoax smelled like a hoax from the word go. The media knew it and still they gleefully advanced it. What joy they took in aiding and abetting this crime, this smear against people they hate — those of us who dare to think different, vote different, worship different; who dare criticize them and not take them seriously.

Oh yes, the media were and are eager co-conspirators in this bias crime.

Hollywood and the media are all driven by hate, by bigotry, by prejudice, and by their desire to harm us because we are different, because they see us as “others.”

And if you think the media and Hollywood hate crimes against us are bad now, wait until the 2020 presidential campaign gets going.

The investigation into the attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett last month continues to be as messy and complicated as ever. Over the weekend, outlets began reporting that the Chicago Police Department believed Smollett staged the violent racist and homophobic attack himself, an allegation the actor denied in an emotional Good Morning, America interview. Empire writers were busy over the weekend too, reportedly at work on rewrites to reduce Smollett’s scenes in the upcoming episodes of the show.

According to a report from Deadline, Smollett’s scenes that were expected to be shot this week on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong series have been cut. His Jamal Lyon was said to be the focus of the penultimate episode of Empire’s current fifth season, which is shooting this week. An initial report from TMZ detailed that those scenes, as well as his involvement in a big musical number, have been axed. Deadline reports that multiple upcoming episodes have undergone “serious rewrites” to reduce Smollett’s Jamal “both in dramatic stints and musical performances.” Fox has yet to comment on the report.

It was previously speculated that Smollett faked the attack against him in response to the series’ supposed plans to kill off Jamal from the show. Fox, along with co-creator Strong and the series’ writers, quickly refuted that, insisting the mystery death the fifth season has been teasing all along isn’t Jamal’s, but that of another character. Just two days ago, Empire executive producer Brett Mahoney shared his support of Smollett on Twitter, so it remains unclear why the network has decided to cut back on Smollett’s role.

As of now, the CPD has requested another interview with the actor for further questioning about the incident and the two brothers formerly held by the police as “persons of interest,” both of whom were extras on Empire. Hopefully we get some clarity on this upsetting and messy situation soon."

Cardi's post came after this weekend's reports that Smollett may have paid two men that he knew to stage the alleged attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt. "" Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s--t was staged, I don't want to completely blame him because ... police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar,” she said.

Smollett has denied that the attack was orchestrated — personally on ""Good Morning America"" — and also via his attorneys.

In an Instagram Live video on Monday, Cardi B said that she is ""really disappointed"" in Jussie Smollett.

""I'm really disappointed in Jussie Smollett,” Cardi B said in a Monday Instagram video. ""I feel like he f---ed up Black History Month, bro.""

The video, which no longer appears on the app, can be viewed on Pop Crave's Twitter account.

Cardi's post comes as police continue to investigate whether Smollett himself was involved in staging a late January assault to make it appear to be a racist and homophobic hate crime, as CNN reported Saturday. Sources told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett may have paid two men to stage the attack.

In the Instagram video, Cardi said that she will try her best to give Smollet the benefit of the doubt.

""Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s--t was staged, I don't want to completely blame him because ... police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar,” she said.

The ""Empire"" star said that on January 29, two attackers put a noose around his neck, chanted pro-Trump slogans, poured bleach on him, and used racist and homophobic slurs.

Chicago police released the two Nigerian brothers arrested in connection to the alleged attack late Friday evening after questioning them. TMZ reports the brothers in question are Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who both reportedly worked on the set of ""Empire.""

Both Smollett and his attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, have pushed back on reports that the alleged attack was orchestrated.

Smollett's attorneys released a statement Saturday night, saying Smollett was being ""further victimized"" by accusations that he planned the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.""

On Wednesday, he appeared on ""Good Morning America,"" saying he was hurt by those who doubted his allegations.

""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth — you don't even want to see the truth,"" he said."

Writing on their Instagram, Smollett’s sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and his brother, Jocqui Smollett, shared quotes from Malcolm X warning that the media has the power to make the innocent look guilty.

“This is the media, the irresponsible media,” the post said. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal. If you aren’t careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”

“This is the media, the irresponsible media,” the posting said. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”

Both Smollett siblings later shared a tweet in support of their brother Jussie, which said that people would still disbelieve him even if definitive evidence proved he endured a hate crime.

“I have a feeling even if we had video of Jussie (Smollett) being attacked…y’all would still discredit him,” the tweet read. “Because it’s easier to believe what aligns with your contempt for survivors of hate crimes, sexual abuse, etc who happen to be LGBTQ+, disabled, or women.”

Despite current evidence indicating that Jussie Smollett staged the hate crime allegedly after a racist note he received did not get enough attention, the actor professed his innocence through his attorneys on Saturday. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The Smollett family has supported their brother ever since the alleged hate crime was first reported, denouncing it as an act of “domestic terrorism.”"

The situation with Smollett has largely been fueled by those on the Left who are eager to see their assumptions about the political opposition realized. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time the news cycle has been dominated by premature reactions related to assertions of racism, sexism, or abuse. In fact, we've seen two other examples recently.

In January, MAGA hat-wearing teens from Covington High School were condemned for taunting a Native American man after a video of the incident went viral. Upon further examination, the truth was evident: the teens had not ridiculed the man, Nathan Phillips. What was nothing more than an awkward interaction prompted a media frenzy, all because of politics. But the damage was done: the Covington kids were racists.

Last September, a similar course of events took place Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Though there was no evidence other than the accuser's words, and none discovered after an FBI investigation, the damage had been done. Kavanaugh was obviously a sexual predator.

The incident with Smollett is much the same. As with Kavanaugh and Covington, there was virtually no interest in waiting for legitimate proof from other individuals or law enforcement. Too many in the media and among the general population are interested in seeing that Trump and his brand are tarnished, no matter the fallout.



The Covington story should've been a gigantic wake-up call to *everyone* to wait for the details of a story to solidify before jumping headfirst into attacking groups of people.



A week later the Jussie Smollett story broke and it was clear that almost nobody learned a thing. — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) February 17, 2019



The rampant discord at the heart of this current political climate has moved from divisive conversation to detrimental action. Unfortunately, the majority of the left-leaning media is ready to lend ""help"" by fanning the partisan flames. We can and should hold them accountable for contributing to these unverified assertions. Their careless behavior may feel good at the moment and bring in viewers, but the repercussions are far-reaching and affect those of all political persuasions.

Individuals can do their part in reducing tensions. While it's impossible to control what cable channels, sites, and pundits suggest, we can all decide to step back from the fray as others rush toward it. We can resolve to wait for evidence, no matter where it may lead, instead of assuming that someone is being entirely truthful or thoroughly dishonest. This means we must set aside our own agendas. A measured response requires that we prepare to call out our own side, if and when necessary, just as we call out those standing opposite of us. That's not a comfortable place to reside, but if we aim to reduce this destructive cycle, it's the only course of action that we can follow.

Kavanaugh was not the perpetrator the media, and Democrats, made him out to be. However, if he had been guilty of sexual abuse, he should have been quickly dismissed by the Right. The Covington kids weren't the racists they were said to be by the media. However, if it was clear they were responsible for ridiculing someone for being a minority, they and their adult handlers should have been excoriated. Now that Smollett's story is collapsing, we are free to condemn his attempts at creating further racial division. But, as with the other two incidents, there is a time and place for these conclusions. That is always after solid evidence, or lack thereof, is presented; never before.

I don't expect those who breathlessly shared Jussie Smollett's initial story to retract it and apologize for their contributions. However, that is the ideal goal as we survey this incident and move forward.

The media, Democrats, and Republicans would do well to remember that we must be careful never to react to incidents without pausing, reflecting, and waiting. If Americans truly desire more unity in these fractured times, we must never automatically assume the worst.

Smollett originally alleged that two white men physically attacked him, making racial and homophobic slurs in the upscale Streeterville neighborhood on Chicago’s north side.

The 36-year-old actor, who has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, claimed one of the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett further alleged his assailants “poured an unknown chemical substance” on him and put a noose around his neck, according to CNN.

CBS affiliate WBBM-TV reported that sources informed the news outlet that Chicago police are seeking to interview the actor again after receiving information the attack was staged. Smollett is believed to have paid two men $3,500 to carry out the fake assault.

The Nigerian men — brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — left for Nigeria the day after the attack and have since returned to the U.S. CNN reported they are now fully cooperating with police.

According to TMZ, in light of these revelations, production sources for the Fox show “Empire” have cut back the nine scenes Smollett was supposed to appear in to only four.

He was slated to appear in a “big musical number” in the second to the last episode, which has been nixed.

“As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members,” TMZ reported.

The Wrap reported that Smollett so far has not agreed to a second interview by police.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday that she is recusing herself from the investigation.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have not further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night Empire actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

A police source told the Chicago Sun-Times that a grand jury could soon be empaneled to investigate Smollett’s now-disputed claims that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Streeterville on Jan. 29.

Tuesday, CPD spokesman Tom Ahern said the two brothers — at least one of whom knew Smollett from working on “Empire” — met with law enforcement officials at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse, though they did not testify.

Around 4 p.m., Gloria Schmidt, the attorney representing the two brothers, walked out of the offices adjacent to the fourth-floor grand jury room, with a group of what looked like plain-clothes law enforcement officers and uniformed sheriff’s officers. Schmidt did not answer questions.

Anne Kavanagh, spokesman for Smollett’s attorney, Todd Pugh, did not respond to requests for comment. The celebrity news site TMZ reported that Smollett had hired high-profile defense lawyer Mark Geragos, whose recent clients include former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office announced Tuesday evening that Kim Foxx had recused herself from the investigation, though she did not say what prompted the recusal.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” according to the state’s attorney’s office.

Earlier in the day, police were following a tip that Smollett was seen in an elevator with the brothers on the same day that he reported being attacked, but that tip was deemed bogus late in the afternoon.

The police department has said for weeks Smollett was the victim of a possible hate crime last month in Streeterville, but investigators may now be probing whether Smollett paid two brothers he knew from “Empire”” to stage the attack, law enforcement sources told the Sun-Times.

Police have been trying to arrange a “follow-up interview” with Smollett, after questioning the brothers, who were taken into custody last week at O’Hare Airport after they got off a return flight from Nigeria. Information from the interview “has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” police said earlier this week.

Smollett has told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident has been investigated as a hate crime.

Smollett has publicly expressed outrage at speculation that he may have set up the attack, including a lengthy interview with Good Morning America host Robin Roberts during which he called out “haters” who doubted his account of what happened. Smollett has acknowledged that one of the two men interviewed by police had served as his personal trainer.

The actor said he was reluctant to call police immediately after the attack because of the attention it would receive. Smollett’s manager, who said he was on the phone with the actor at the time of the assault, called authorities 40 minutes later. Smollett has since been interviewed by police and turned over redacted records from his cellphone.

Two of Smollett’s siblings took to Instagram to defend their brother Tuesday.

The two shared a photo of Malcolm X next to a tweaked quote of his in which he derided the news media.

“This is the media, an irresponsible media,” the photo reads. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”Contributing: Andy Grimm

Smollett had alleged on Jan. 29 that he had been physically assaulted by two men around 2 a.m. after obtaining a sandwich from a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago.

Smollett claimed that during the attack, bleach was poured on him, a noose was placed around his neck and he was berated with homophobic and racist slurs by two men, presumable supporters of President Donald Trump, who yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

A significant portion of the media uncritically accepted Smollett’s allegations, as did a number of prominent Democratic politicians, including 2020 presidential contender and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who referred to the alleged assault as a “modern-day lynching” that must be condemned.

Booker wasted no time in tweeting that same day as the alleged attack, “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

Now, several weeks later, and in light of the new information that substantially undermines Smollett’s initial claim, Booker’s hot-take tweet remains active, but the senator’s tune has changed quite a bit when he’s asked about the still-developing facts of the controversial incident.

A reporter named Megan Pratz posted a brief video clip to Twitter of Booker answering a question Sunday morning about the increasing likelihood of Smollett’s attack having been a hoax perpetrated by the actor himself. Notably, Booker was far more circumspect in his response than he had been initially.

“Well, the information is still coming out, so I’m going to withhold until all of the information comes out from on the record sources,” Booker said, finally issuing the kind of response that should have been out the day after the alleged hate crime.

Of course, he couldn’t let it without adding some Democratic demagoguery.

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way,” he continued. “We actually know in this country that since 9/11, the majority of terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks, the majority of them white supremacist attacks.”

“From the horrific shootings in Pittsburgh or the South Carolina church, what we are seeing is attacks on people because they are different,” claimed Booker. “And we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and bigotry that sources them.”

As noted, the first portion of Booker’s response was correct, in that people — especially public figures — should refrain from passing judgement on certain events until all of the information has been released and the truth of what happened has been fully made known.

That’s something he and far too many other leftists in politics and the media most certainly didn’t do in this case.

However, any goodwill he may have garnered with the correct response to the Smollett case now is overshadowed by his refusal to address his initial hot take, either in taking down the post or admitting publicly that his first reaction was incorrect. Not doing so only serves to highlight his hypocrisy and one-sided view of reality.

Furthermore, his pushing of the ridiculously misleading and debunked narrative about terrorist attacks in America since 9/11 won’t help him win any favor outside of his own frothingly hateful and increasingly violence-prone base of leftist voters.

Finally, the absurdity of his using past incidents of racist white men committing violent crimes against minorities as a comparison to somehow support the alleged assault on Smollett — which appears to have involved two brothers who are friends with and paid by Smollett — is perversely bizarre and undermines whatever measure of credibility on the issue of race-based crimes he may have gained by now withholding judgement on the Smollett case.

Sen. Booker has long been a typical liberal hypocrite, and while he had a chance to change that perception by appropriately dealing with the Smollett case, all he ended up doing was reinforcing it.

By not addressing his horribly wrong initial take and seemingly doubling down on his supposition that right-wing, white-on-black violence is the biggest and most pressing issue this nation faces, he did a disservice to the country.

That’s not a good move for a prospective presidential candidate to make.

But a lot has changed since then.

The Fox show is reportedly in the process of cutting Smollett scenes from upcoming episodes, TMZ and Deadline are both reporting. The drama series is currently in production, but Deadline reports that Smollett will be ""a rare presence"" on set this week and that ""upcoming episodes have seen serious rewrites"" to minimize his role. TMZ similarly reports that scripts have ""undergone multiple revisions"" and that scenes where he's the focus are being removed. But Deadline says there aren't plans to cut Smollett out of episodes that had already been shot.

Smollett has alleged he was the victim of a hate crime and that two men attacked him in Chicago, specifically targeting him because of his role on Empire and screaming ""This is MAGA country"" at him while they beat him, covered him in bleach, and tied a rope around his neck. Since then, questions have emerged about his account, with two local Chicago news stations reporting last week that police now suspect that Smollett staged the attack himself, something he has strongly denied. One report suggested he may have done so because he was in danger of being written off Empire.

Fox pushed back on that report, saying that the idea that Smollett ""has been, or would be, written of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" with the network adding, ""we continue to stand behind him."" But since then, police have said that the case's ""trajectory"" has changed, and CNN is reporting that cops believe he paid the two men to attack him and that the men are cooperating with law enforcement.

There was no crazed MAGA attack.

The vice president was not somehow complicit (as per Ellen Page).

This did not reveal the violent state of our nation.

Instead, the response to the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett revealed another dark side of America.

A dark side just as ugly and potentially even more dangerous.

This is America, 2019.

It is an America in which we rush to judgment before having the facts at hand. And it is an America in which we also function as judge and jury, taking the law into our own hands.

It is an America in which soundbites educate and in which edited video clips inform.

It is an America which could easily lead to a volatile mobocracy.

Do you think I'm exaggerating?

Do you think there would not be a violent attack on the home of an alleged racist homophobe, simply based on an allegation? Do you think there would not be a physical assault on the person himself? Do you think that if Jussie Smollett had identified an alleged attacker by name that his life would not be endangered?

""There he is! Get him!""

And get him they would—without facts, without verification, without justification.

It's bad enough that menacing protesters showed up at the home of Tucker Carlson.

It's bad enough that a disruptive little gang could drive Senator Ted Cruz and his family from a restaurant.

It's bad enough that the Covington Catholic School had to shut down temporarily because of threats. (And may I point out that all these acts of mobocracy have come from the left?)

But it's even worse when the media are complicit in fanning the flames.

It's even worse when reporters report irresponsibly, just because the story fits their narrative. (In Joy Behar's candid admission, it's ""because we're desperate to get rid Trump out."") Have they forgotten the word ""alleged""? (In this context, a New York Times op-ed by Noah Rothman is relevant, addressing, ""An object lesson in what happens when people in positions of political and cultural authority indulge their biases by suspending disbelief."")

And what happens when political leaders join in the frenzy, also suspending critical judgment because the report so perfectly supports their biases? What happens when they're joined by outspoken celebrities?

To say this would result in a highly toxic, genuinely dangerous situation would be an understatement.

As to the larger societal sickness that this latest episode has revealed, Andy Ngo had this to say over at the National Review: ""Jussie Smollett's hoax is symptomatic of America's illness. Because of the mainstreaming of academia's victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable or even kind. Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted, treated with child gloves and believed unreservedly. Their 'lived experience' gives them infinite wisdom. Those who urge caution are treated as bigots.""

The reality is that we did almost have a modern-day lynching.

A lynching of all those who would dare wear a MAGA hat. A lynching of Trump supporters in general. A lynching of those who happen to be white or who do not celebrate homosexuality.

All of them (of us?) were now complicit in the alleged attack on a gay black man.

This is America, 2019—and we're only in February.

May I suggest that all of us slow down and take a deep breath? That we make a personal determination to investigate and confirm before drawing a conclusion? (Ironically, Sen. Kamala Harris, one of the first political leaders to rush to judgment and refer to a ""modern-day lynching,"" now wants to wait for a full investigation of the alleged attack before commenting on its apparent mendacity. So she was quick to believe its truthfulness but cautious to believe its falsehood.)

Can we make this unfortunate situation into a teachable moment for all of us, regardless of our political persuasions?

There are enough real issues of racism or hatred to focus on and address. We can agree on their wrongness and work together for a better country.

But our intellectually lazy and morally irresponsible rushes to judgment, coupled with the very real threat of mob violence, have moved us on to very dangerous ground.

Time to take slow down and take stock. Or else.

Jussie Smollet‘s hate crime case has been complex and confusing to follow, but this hasn’t stopped fans, critics, and celebrities alike from offering commentary on what’s known and unknown. Cardi B is the latest public figure to chime in with her two cents.

The rapper broadcasted her commentary on Instagram Live Monday, criticizing and questioning Smollet for his reported hate crime account, saying, “I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett— whatever the fuck his name is,” adding, “I feel like he fucked up Black History Month.”

Last week, authorities disputed local media reports and public speculation that Smollet’s attack was a hoax. The latest reports state Chicago police citing claims from two brothers affiliated with the actor were arrested as persons of interest, and now allege he paid them to stage the attack.

Report: Chicago Police Claim Jussie Smollett Staged His Own Attack

“Until he says out his mouth that this was fake and this shit staged then I don’t want to completely blame him. Because like someone I was talking to like they said police in Chicago are racists so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you fucked up for real. Why would you do that?”

She went on to say she’s willing to give Smollett “the benefit of the doubt” because of her own past experiences with the police, citing a story from several years ago in which she claims an NYPD officer put her in a headlock following a roadside dispute. She publically spoke on the incident and deleted the tweet and Instagram post shortly after.

Cardi went on to say the police attempted to intimidate her and her family to give a statement, but she never did. She then says the police “put out a statement saying that I did it to promote my album. Mind you, my album wasn’t even planned.” “Because I didn’t put out a statement, they put out a statement claiming that I was practically lying. So, I don’t want to call Jussie Smollett a complete lie.”

In September 2017, she went on talk about the incident in an interview with 99 JAMZ.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday that she is recusing herself from the investigation.

................................................................

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have not further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

As you may have seen, I deactivated all my Facebook accounts this past weekend, after Facebook blocked for hours a link to my TAC commentary on the Jussie Smollett hate hoax. Infuriatingly, my wife’s account is receiving FB notices when people mention me in their FB comments. I’m trying to figure out how to block that too. It’s not easy to quit them, even if you want to. Hotel Facebook: you can check in, but you can never leave.

If you’re wavering, here’s another reason to drop the medium: they banned a post featuring a photo of the Coptic martyrs kneeling before their ISIS executioners.Faith McDonnell explains what happened in an open letter to Facebook. Excerpts:

Frequently when I’ve been on Facebook searching through treasured photo memories, I’ve had the fleeting thought, “Wow, what if I ever lost all this!” I had no idea that moment was soon coming. But it did last week, February 15. You, Facebook, informed me my account had been disabled for “violating community standards.” February 15 became the day you cut me off. Cut me off from over 2000 friends and thousands of photos on Facebook, from communicating on Messenger, and even from using my extremely innocuous Instagram. But it was already a date to remember. And that’s what actually got me in trouble.

More:

On February 15, 2015, 21 men were slaughtered on a Libyan seashore by ISIS. The 20 Coptic Christians and their fellow martyr, Matthew from Ghana, were the subject of the jihadis’ grisly snuff film sent to the “People of the Cross.” The image of those soon-to-be-saints in orange jumpsuits kneeling on the beach in front of their killers became a powerful testimony of Christ’s victory over death and hell. On that anniversary I decided to honor these courageous and faithful men on my Facebook page. Scrolling through photos I had posted on Facebook in the past without ever a problem, I found that well-known image and made it my temporary Facebook profile photo. Then it happened!

Read the whole thing.

They cut McDonnell, an Anglican human rights activist, off permanently, without right of appeal. She has lost everything she ever posted on Facebook.

The image she posted is either the one atop this post, or one like it. Those murdered Christians are honored today by the Coptic Church as canonized martyrs. Terry Mattingly’s latest column talks about them, and a new book about them out by German writer Martin Mosebach. Excerpt:

The unforgettable images showed the paradox of faith, [Mosebach] stressed. After all, [Coptic Archbishop Angelaos] said, stabbing the air with his hand, here were 21 “men who were “for all intents and purposes weak and defeated, kneeling before their oppressors … with big knives to their throats. Yet suddenly it makes you think: Where is the power in this picture? Is it in the big men, with the big knives, with the covered faces, with the big voices, with the big threats? Or is it in those who knelt bravely, with humility, confidence and resilience and a faithfulness that was unshaken and unshakable?” Mosebach studied full versions of the Islamic State group’s video נa message to the “nation of the cross” and focused on glances of encouragement the men exchanged before they were pushed face down into the sand and beheaded. These were “average” Copts, but church records detailed their visits to monasteries, and six had been ordained as “minor clerics.” Though most were illiterate, they chanted the three-hour liturgy by memory נin Arabic, Greek and ancient Copt נwhen priests visited them in Libya. Family members, said Mosebach, took comfort from the brutal video because it recorded their loved ones saying, “Ya Rabbi Yassou! (Oh, my Lord Jesus)” seconds before dying. These were the quick prayers of martyrs, adding them to the faithful referenced in Revelation, chapter 20: “I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast. … They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”

Here is a link to Mosebach’s new book, The 21: A Journey Into The Land Of Coptic Martyrs.

You should see these slaughtered men’s faces in their last moments of life, even if Facebook doesn’t want you to."

John Adams blamed his defeat at the hands of Thomas Jefferson in 1800 on the hired group of mendacious party-hack scribblers (paid by Jefferson) falsely claiming, among many other enormities, that Adams was a toady of the British seeking to impose monarchy and aristocracy on America.

This caused a rift between the former close friends for decades, th wounds of which were only healed when Adams’s talented wife Abigail finally brought them back together.

The Adams-Jefferson feud had a happy ending, but corrosive public mendacity is still with us. The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 did not permit anyone to serve in the commonwealth’s legislature unless he was prepared to swear or affirm that he believed in a just God who rewarded the good and punished the wicked.

Over the years, we have driven morality and religion from the public square, and with it, apparently, has gone virtually all restraint on misrepresentation and political chicanery.

The mainstream media constantly claims that President Trump shades the truth, but an objective observer would have to conclude that it is his enemies in the Democratic party who have him over-matched.

This is clearly true with regard to the current controversy over the necessity for border security, specifically whether or not it is appropriate for the president to use his executive authority (supplied by statute) to repurpose appropriated funds to use in the construction of an effective fence or wall.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and Speaker of the U.S. House Nancy Pelosi both claim that the president has ""manufactured a crisis,"" that this is an improper use of executive emergency authority, and that it will lead a future president similarly to abuse his or her office in order to accomplish a policy goal that might be anathema to Republicans.

Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi raised no such concerns when other presidents invoked emergency executive authority almost 60 times over the last few decades.

The two also conveniently ignore the pleas of such as even President Obama’s U.S. Border Patrol chief, Mark Morgan, who joins many Angel families and the current border security authorities who believe Congress has failed in its job of securing our southern border and that the problem of the flow of drugs and illicit human traffic has, indeed reached crisis proportions.

Democrats are the party of open borders, and simply ignore the costs to many Americans because they foresee a stream of future political supporters. Mr. Trump and his supporters see it differently, but those who wrongly disparage and distort the views of Trump and the Republicans are rarely held to account.

A similar episode of shameless mendacity may be taking place in the case of Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American TV star who claimed to be the victim of a racially and homophobically tinged assault in Chicago.

In one of the coldest nights in that city, Smollet purported to have been assaulted by two white men, at least one of whom was wearing a red hat, who allegedly poured bleach on him, hurled slurs at him, and placed a noose around his neck, after informing him that he was in ""MAGA country.""

The implausibility of anyone in Chicago, among the bluest of cities, claiming it was MAGA country was plain from the beginning. We now know that his purported assailants (captured nearby on video) were Nigerians, at least one of whom was Smollet’s friend and colleague from his TV show.

There are now reports that the two, when apprehended told police Smollet had paid them several thousand dollars to fake the attack on the star. It was originally believed that Smollet may have concocted the plot in order to advance his career, but he has been a virulent foe of the current president, and a desire to undermine Mr. Trump cannot be discounted.

The final episode of outright fabrication to mention is, of course, the plot hatched by Clinton operatives and eagerly embraced by sympathetic Obama administration intelligence and law enforcement officials to claim Trump/Russia collusion.

This week we learned, as a by-product of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s book tour, that McCabe and other FBI officials toyed with the replacement of Donald Trump using the 25th Amendment, in a neat move that would have circumvented the judgment of the Electoral College in determining the president.

Democracy, it is said, dies in darkness, but constitutional government cannot survive if the American people cannot summon the virtue truthfully to engage in self-government.

We are fortunate to have a president who understands the gravity of our situation, and we can only hope that the mainstream media will begin to awaken to their responsibilities.

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, upset after a racist letter sent to the show’s studio didn’t get a “bigger reaction,” is suspected of paying two men to attack him a week later, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the investigation.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information.

The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville.

{snip}

Smollett received a letter containing a white powder Jan. 22. The letter was mailed to Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where the show “Empire” is filmed. The letter prompted a HAZMAT response. CPD says the “white substance” was later determined to be aspirin.

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps.

{snip}

When asked about the letter in a televised interview last week, Smollett said, “On the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it.” It also had “MAGA” — reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan Make America Great Again – written as the return address.

{snip}

During the search of the brothers’ home last week, a “piece of paper/writing” was also seized. CBS 2 is the only news source with video from inside that house. Police evidence logs exclusively obtained by CBS 2, show investigators took the writing sample, magazine, and a “wallet with stamps.”

{snip}

Chicago police say the FBI is handling the investigation surrounding the letter, because that’s a federal-level concern.

{snip}

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500.

The ""Empire"" star's sister Jurnee and brother Jocqui both quoted Malcolm X, claiming the media has made ""the victim look like the criminal.""

Jussie Smollett's siblings believe the media is to blame for what happened —- or didn't happen —- to their brother.

The actor's sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell and brother Jocqui Smollett both posted to Instagram a tweaked quote by Malcolm X in response to the mounting skepticism over the alleged racist and homophobic attack last month.

""This is the media, the irresponsible media. It will make the criminal look like he's the victim and make the victim look like he's the criminal,"" the post reads.

""If you aren't careful, the media will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.""

Jocqui also reposted a tweet from a fan which read: ""I have a feeling even if we had video of Jussie Smollett being attacked...y'all would still discredit him. Because it's easier to believe what aligns with your contempt for survivors of hate crimes, sexual abuse, etc who happen to be LGBTQ+, disabled, or women.""

Last month, Smollett claimed he had been attacked by two masked men who shouted racist and anti-gay slurs — in addition to yelling ""this is MAGA country"" — before he was viciously beaten and had a chemical poured on him.

But on Saturday Chicago police released a statement confirming a pivot in the direction of their investigation after interviewing the two Nigerian brothers who were initially considered suspects.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Two law enforcement sources also told CNN that CPD are now operating under the belief that Smollett paid the two brothers, who he knew from ""Empire,"" to orchestrate an assault on him; however this has not been confirmed by law enforcement. Attorneys for Smollett claimed that the actor felt ""victimized"" by the various media reports suggesting he may have been involved in orchestrating his own attack.

Jussie is one of six siblings; his family have stood by his account since it was first reported, making the following statement: ""In the early hours of Tuesday morning, our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.""

""Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. Our family thanks everyone for their prayers and the huge amount of love he has received. We are thankful to our village for your immense support during this trying time. We are so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive. Jussie is a warrior whose light cannot be dimmed.

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country. Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such. They will continue to occur until we hold each other accountable.

""Make no mistake, words matter. Hateful words lead to hateful actions. Radical love is the only solution, but passivity will be our downfall. We, as a family, will continue to work for love, equity and justice until it reigns supreme in our nation and all over the world."""

2:45 PM PT — Chicago police are now calling the tip ""unfounded,"" saying, ""CPD has confirmed that a tip this morning about a sighting at the residential towers of individuals involved in this alleged incident is unfounded as it was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives.""

Chicago police are investigating a tip that Jussie Smollett was seen with the two Nigerian brothers on the night they allegedly attacked him, reportedly at the direction of the ""Empire"" star.

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department says that police received a tip from someone who either lives in Smollett's building or is staying there. The person says they saw Smollett in an elevator with Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo on the same night as the alleged attack.

According to local reports, Smollett came up with the plan to have two men attack him after a threatening letter he received a week earlier failed to get a bigger reaction.

The Osundairo brothers gave a statement on Monday, saying, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Nicknamed Ola and Abel, the two brothers have also retained an attorney, who has that the two brothers know Smollett from work on “Empire,” and worked out with him at their gym.

In a statement released on Monday morning, Smollett’s rep, Anne Kavanagh said, “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

UPDATE 2/20/19 at 1PM:

Fox and Empire producer 20th Century Fox TV are standing by Jussie Smollett as new reports allege the actor staged his physical attack that occurred in Chicago on January 29.

They confirmed Smollett is not being written off the show in a statement: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""

The CPD is investigating the claims that the 36-year-old paid two brothers he knew to stage the attack. No one has been charged yet but if guilty of the hoax, Smollett could face up to three years in prison.

ORIGINAL STORY:

As the Chicago police department continues to investigate the alleged attack against Jussie Smollett, the actor's role on Empire will be cut back.

According to Deadline, the Fox drama has eliminated some of Smollett's upcoming scenes as they continue production in Chicago — including a musical number per TMZ — and the actor will have a limited amount of time on set and not rehearse.

Empire returns for the remainder of its fifth season on March 13, and the writers room in currently knee-deep in edits and script revisions.

Smollett has become the subject of a much criticism over the long weekend as news broke that the star supposedly arranged for the assault to happen and paid the alleged culprits. The CPD have requested another interview with Smollett to go over the events that took place in late January and investigate if the attack was staged or pre-planned in any capacity.

At this time, Smollett is not considered a suspect. The CPD did arrest brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo as “persons of interest” in connection with the crime but released them on February 15.

Smollett portrays Jamal Lyon — an openly gay musician — on the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series He spoke out on GMA about the alleged attack and denied lying about incident.

""I’m pissed off,"" Smollett told Robin Roberts. “It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it. Because it’s the truth,” he said. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

When asked why he thinks he was targeted, Smollett said because he's critical of President Trump.

“I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says ‘fa**ot Empire ni**er,’ ‘This is MAGA country, ni**er,’ ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight?” he detailed. “It’s unbelievable to me that any of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”

New details to come."

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.



Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

Bisexual rapper Cardi B. took her reservations to social media, expressing her frustration with Smollett.

“I’m really disappointed in him,” she says. “I feel like he f*cked up Black History Month, bro. I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he says it out his mouth that it was fake and the sh*t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to, they said police in Chicago are racist. So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.

Meanwhile, journalist Jeff Taylor reports comedian Dave Chappelle also addressed the controversy during a recent stand-up set in Charlotte, North Carolina. Having informed the audience of growing doubts over the legitimacy of the Smollett attack, Chappelle joked that he wanted to “break a dollhouse over [the actor’s] head”–a veiled reference to a homophobic joke made by comedian Kevin Hart. Hart lost out on hosting the Oscars after his homophobic tweets resurfaced, and the comic refused to apologize for them. Chappelle went on to scrutinize elements of Smollett’s account of the attack repeating false rumours that Smollett had said his attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats and that the producers of Empire had planned to fire him from the show.

The attack on Jussie Smollett occurred on January 29 in Chicago. Smollett alleges that multiple attackers physically assaulted him, doused him with chemicals and tied a noose around his neck while calling him “fa*got ni*ger.” Various news outlets have begun to report, however, that Smollett may have paid two brothers who worked on the show Empire to stage the attack for publicity. Online speculation has hypothesized that Smollett may have done so to boost his popularity and prevent the show’s producers from writing his character off the show.

Fox, the network behind Empire, as well as writers for the show, have denied that they’d ever considered removing Smollett from the series. Chicago police have also released statements saying they do not question the veracity of Smollett’s account."

Evan Agostini/Invision / AP

CHICAGO — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. But last week, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett. They have declined to comment on reports that the attack was a hoax.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."""

Smollett has been a star on the FOX Television show “Empire.”

On February 17, an attorney for Smollett said he the actor was “angered and devastated by recent reports” stating that the police were changing their theory of the case to the direction of an “orchestrated” hate attack.

Unsubstantiated rumors swirled that the two suspects arrested in the crime provided evidence to the investigators that contributed to the change in direction on the part of the investigators.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” he added.

Smollett’s response to the rumor that the attack was staged was pointed.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” Smollett stated through his attorneys.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continues. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Chicago Police spokesman Guglielmi told reporters. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect,” he added.

Several reports claim that Smollett offered to pay two Nigerian models, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, $4,000 to stage the January 29 assault. Those reports are unconfirmed."

The family of Jussie Smollett are reportedly responsible for the actor’s scenes being cut down in Empire, as they are concerned for his wellbeing after he was attacked earlier this month.

The 36-year-old, who has played Jamal Lyon on the series since 2015, has reportedly received less screen time in the final episodes of the current season.

According to TMZ, Jussie was originally scheduled to appear in ‘nine scenes and a big musical number’ in the season’s penultimate episode. However, producers have allegedly slashed his appearance to four scenes while it’s claimed the musical performance will no longer happen.

A source has now told Metro.co.uk exclusively that Jussie’s family pushed for his workload to be cut as they are concerned he returned to filming too soon after the attack.

Earlier in February, Jussie reported he had been brutally attacked by two men in Chicago. His lawyers have since been forced to deny claims that he isn’t being truthful about the incident.

The insider said: ‘Jussie’s role on Empire was reduced at the request of his family who believed going back to work shortly after the incident was a mistake, not because producers believe he is lying about it.

‘He was keen to shoot scenes and commit to the production schedule. When coupled with the fact that the men he says attacked him still pose as a security risk, his family begged him to take time off.’

Two men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were arrested and questioned in relation to the incident but later released without charge.

The source added: ‘The production team at the show are behind him all the way but could see he needed some breathing space so agreed to give him as much time off as he would like.

‘The decision was his.’

As the Chicago PD continues probing for the truth following the Empire star’s claims that he’s the victim of a homophobic and racial attack, the FOX series might be pulling Smollett offscreen. That is to say, last week saw reports that police believe that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack with the help of two Empire extras. The actor/singer’s lawyers have denied that their client did any such thing, yet conflicting information has led many, including Cardi B, to state that, if he’s culpable, Smollett would have “f*cked up black history month.”

Allegations of a staged attack are still swirling and will be bolstered by a new Associated Press report about police investigating a tip that Smollett may have been in the elevator (on the night of the alleged attack) with the two men who were questioned and released by police. Deadline now reports that, although already completed Empire episodes won’t be modified, the series is scaling Smollett back from his role in the musical dynasty series beginning with this week’s production:

Deadline has confirmed with well placed sources that Smollett’s scenes in episodes of the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series are being slashed for production on Empire this week. While the show is back at work today in the Windy City after the long weekend, Smollett will be a rare presence on the set of the Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard led show.

This update follows two days after Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney tweeted that he continues to “believe and stand by @JussieSmollett.”

Mahoney hasn’t followed up on this tweet, but CNN reports that the two men who were questioned by Chicago police are no longer considered suspects following the discovery of “new evidence” in the case. CNN also revealed on Monday that Smollett currently has no set time to speak with detectives again:"

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe.

Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night last month that Smollett says two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday."

What does Trump/Russia collusion, the rage over the Covington Catholic High School students, and the virtue-signaling inspired by “Empire” star Jussie Smollett’s MAGA hate-crime attack all have in common? They are anti-Donald Trump narratives devoid of truth. What Greek philosopher Socrates called the noble lie, contrived…

“… to persuade, in the best case, even the rulers, but if not them, the rest of the city.”

The Smollett narrative

Jussie Smollett tells us he was the victim of assault on the streets of Chicago. That MAGA hat-wearing thugs hurled racial and homophobic slurs his way and doused him in bleach. They also placed a noose around his neck, saying, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett’s weepy tale certainly fits the dominant cultural narrative established by the Democrat/Media/Entertainment complex. It states that Americans (read “deplorables”) who elevated Trump to the presidency are racist, homophobic, and extremely violent.





That narrative certainly dovetailed nicely with that of Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters.

“This is happening for a reason. Why, all of a sudden, do we have people unable to study while black? Unable to mow a lawn while black? Unable to have a picknick while black and being attacked? It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog-whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing. And he is basically emboldening those folks.”

Democrat Sen. Cory “Spartacus” Booker took to Twitter and expressed his outrage.

The Washington Post’s global opinion editor Karen Attiah fumed,

“Regarding the heinous attack on @JussieSmollett, yet another reminder that Trump’s ascendance and the resulting climate of hate has meant that lives have been increasingly at stake since 2015. Smollett could have been killed by those thugs screaming MAGA. Let that sink in.”

Oops!

But there were a few problems with Smollett’s narrative.

The two “thugs” questioned by Chicago police turned out to be African-American brothers, Oabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, one of which was Smollett’s workout trainer. He also just happened to have played a bit part in an episode of “Empire.”

The brothers wore plain red baseball caps purchased at a beauty supply store and not MAGA hats.

And Chicago is most definitely not “MAGA country.” According to the Chicago Board of Elections, Hillary Clinton received 83.7 percent of the Windy City’s vote compared to Donald Trump’s meager 12.5.

The brothers told Chicago police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to perpetuate the hoax.

Sources told the CBS affiliate in Chicago that Smollett was angry that Fox failed to publicize a racist/homophobic letter sent to the “Empire” star at the show’s Chicago studio last January. A note in which letters cut from the pages of a magazine were pasted on the page.

A note that contained the anti-Trump narrative’s dreaded “MAGA” dog-whistle.

CBS 2 also reported that police retrieved writing paper and magazines from the Osundairo brother’s Chicago apartment. It sounds like Smollett’s hoax may have been an anti-Trump narrative wrapped within an anti-Trump narrative, courtesy of the enigmatic duo.

The Covington Catholic High School narrative

When students from Covington Catholic High School, their heads crowned with MAGA hats, smirked at the ridiculous antics of a modern American leftist playing an ancient Native American beating a drum, they were savaged by a contrived anti-Trump narrative concocted by the dominant Democrat/Media/Entertainment complex.

New York Times bestselling author Reza Aslan quipped:

“Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid’s?

Honest question. Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid’s? pic.twitter.com/jolQ7BZQPD — Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) January 20, 2019

Reza’s website touts his book “God: A Human History” as making “sense of the divine, and sounds a call to embrace a deeper, more expansive understanding of God.”

Apparently, that understanding involves a high school student turning the other cheek so Reza could punch it.

Former New York Times reporter and Pulitzer Prize nominee, Kurt Eichenwald, adds his two cents to the narrative. Going to Twitter, Eichenwald says the smiling young man “should be identified and denied all work in perpetuity.”

Realizing the harshness of his words, Eichenwald doubled down on his statement:

“I know that some might say I am being too harsh on teenagers. Unfortunately, the evil unleashed by Trump has infected millions of teenagers – with their Hitler valentines, Nazi-salutes, and the infection can only be cured with harsh consequences.”

…I know that some might say I am being too harsh on teenagers. Unfortunately, the evil unleashed by Trump has infected millions of teenagers – with their Hitler valentines, nazi-salutes, and bullying of non-whites – and the infection can only be cured with harsh consequences. — Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) January 19, 2019

Oops again!

Videos later emerged to reveal the old Native leftist with the little drum was the one who came to harass the young Covington students, not the other way around. The students did not answer the lunatic with violence or a turned cheek. Instead, they laughed.

It is the promoters of the anti-Trump narrative who “infect millions” with the kind of hate-filled propaganda that would make Joseph Goebbels smile.

The Trump/Russia collusion narrative

Prior to his election as president, a dossier claiming Trump cavorted with Russian prostitutes while on business in Moscow began circulating among major news organizations. The man shopping the dossier was its author, British spy Christopher Steele.

The media initially refused to print the dossier’s contents due to the unverifiable nature of its accusations, but came on board after Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller special counsel to investigate possible links between Trump and Russia.

A slew of indictments have come down since Mueller’s appointment, but not one having to do with Russian collusion.

The narrative of Democrat/Media/Entertainment complex says Trump won the presidency due to his alliance with Russian strongman, Vladimir Putin. Without help from Russia, goes the narrative, Americans would not have been so polarized. And our electoral system would not have been hacked, undermining American democracy. Instead, a happy, united America would have elected Hillary Clinton its first female president.

Oops, oops, and oops again!

It turns out the Steele dossier was nothing more than an opposition research document paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

One that provided the flimsy evidence used by a Democratic administration’s FBI to launch a counterespionage caper against the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.

A caper in which Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein contemplated wearing a wire to surreptitiously tape his conversations with President Trump. The same Rod Rosenstein that launched the Mueller probe. Recordings that, according to former deputy FBI chief Andrew McCabe, would allow unelected Justice Department bureaucrats to unseat a duly elected president.

The Trump/Russia collusion narrative, we now know, is a ham-fisted attempt to mask the greatest conspiracy against a sitting American president in our nation’s history.

Print the narrative

In the 1962 western classic “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” the film ends with small-town newspaper editor Matthew Scott spiking a story that fails to service a noble lie.

“When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”

Here in the real world, there is no nobility in a lie. Especially lies intended to present narratives even less plausible than those in a Hollywood script.

The latest reports now claim that Smollet staged the assault after he became upset that a letter threatening him, which was sent to Empire's studio, did not get enough attention.

Monday, Cardi took to Instagram Live to share her thoughts on the matter.

""So, I'm really disappointed in Jussie Smollet,"" the Grammy-winning rapper began. ""I feel like he f***** up Black History Month, bro.""

However, Cardi did not completely dismiss the seriousness of the Empire star's claims.

She continued, ""I don't want to completely blame him. You know, police in Chicago are racists. So, they probably tryna' frame him and make him look like he's a liar.""

""But, if he's not...then bro you f***** up for real. Why would you do that?""

Cardi's comments follow the news that the two men implicated in attacking Smollett -- brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo -- told police the actor paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the January 29 attack..

This article was published 19/2/2019 (490 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

(Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanour complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

This version of the story corrects the 4th paragraph to say that last week police said reports the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed. Corrects earlier version saying that police had declined to comment on whether it was a hoax.

Jussie Smollett is not officially canceled just yet as the investigation in his case is still ongoing. However, it looks like some people are starting to take a couple of step back from the actor.

RELATED: Law Enforcement Claims Jussie Smollett Rehearsed Attack With Two Brothers

According to TMZ, scenes featuring Smollett on the hit series “Empire” have been drastically cut following the big controversy surrounding his alleged hate attack. Smollett who plays gay singer/songwriter Jamal Lyon on the show, was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical performance in the second-to-last episode of Season 5, production sources told TMZ, but five scenes and the musical set have been axed.

It was also said that Smollett’s character is no longer the focus of his remaining four scenes, instead, the show will now feature an ensemble of characters.

While this may seem big, Jussie has bigger problems to worry about. So far, reports are claiming he rehearsed his attack with two Nigerian men who used to be extra’s on the show.

Smollet’s attorney has since denied those claims and maintains that he’s the victim here. TMZ, reports that Jussie’s case is actually heading to a Grand Jury today. Law enforcement sources say the focus is presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Jussie for allegedly filing a false police report.

According to Cillizza, the core truth of these incidents is that both sides, left and right, are doing the same thing to the other. So, first up, here’s what the left did in the Smollett case:

California Sen. Kamala Harris called it “an attempted modern-day lynching.” So did New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. (He used those exact same words.) “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color,” tweeted New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. On and on it went. Why? Because it seemed so ready-made for politicians hoping to make a point about the poisoning of our culture by Trump and his ilk: Smollett is gay, black and an outspoken critic of Trump. Of course Trump supporters reacted violently!

Okay, fair enough. Now here’s what conservatives did:

…sources with knowledge of the case have told CNN the police now believe Smollett paid two men — brothers — to stage the attack on him. Smollett has denied that charge but has yet to speak again directly with the police about the circumstances surrounding the incident on January 29. That news has led to a massive conservative counterattack — on Democrats and the media who they argue were all too willing to cast Smollett as the victim of an attack, even though corroborating evidence was in short supply.

So the left attacked without waiting for the facts and the right counterattacked based on what police told the media after an investigation of the case. Is that really the same thing? Cillizza says it is:

…politics has become so, so base-centric in the last decade-ish, politicians are forever on the hunt for stories that confirm what their base already believes. If they can be the first and/or loudest voice in condemnation, they believe that helps them — especially when they are running for president. And so, Democratic 2020 candidates were very quick to believe Smollett’s version of events. And now Republicans — especially those aligned with the Trump White House — are just as quick to seize on the idea this was all an elaborate hoax. Both sides are simply exhibiting confirmation bias.

Look, I’m prepared to admit that both sides of the aisle exhibit confirmation bias. I’m just not sure this is a really good example and here’s why: A police investigation is not cognitive bias. The left jumped on the initial reports of this story and the media played it up. It fit their preconceived idea of who Trump supporters are and it made all those people look bad. The right had doubts and those doubts appear to have been substantially (though not finally) confirmed by a police investigation that involved looking at street cam video, speaking to witnesses, and arresting two suspects based on their movements that night via Uber. Then, after a day of interrogation, the suspects were released after reportedly telling police Smollett organized the attack and paid them to carry it out. That’s not cognitive bias its evidence.

Granted, the story could take another turn today or tomorrow. Smollett hasn’t confessed. Maybe the brothers are lying. But it’s simply not the case that we have the same lack of information now that we had at the start. We really do know a lot more now about this incident that isn’t purely what we hope is true. So I don’t think it’s fair to say both sides are engaged in the same type of leaping to conclusions based solely on prior assumptions.

Later in his piece, Cillizza mentions the Covington Catholic story as another example of both sides engaging in confirmation bias. And here again, I have to say that’s not what happened. The left absolutely jumped to conclusions based on a brief video clip that didn’t give any context. Basically, they saw a smirking kid and proclaimed him the poster child for Trump’s America, a hateful figure with no respect for adults.

And then people began looking at the lengthy videotapes showing exactly what happened. And it turned out, Nick Sandmann wasn’t the aggressor, hadn’t threatened or blocked anyone. In fact, his group had been the subject of racist taunts from Black Hebrew and Native American groups and had mostly resisted responding in kind. It also turned out that the person who claimed he was the victim, Nathan Phillips, was lying about a lot of what he said on television.

The right put forth the evidence that the mob had gotten this wrong and gradually, a number of honest people on the left admitted they’d made a mistake and some even apologized and deleted their initial reactions (the threat of lawsuits may have helped motivate a few).

The point is that, once again, the left and right were not engaged in the same project. One side was running full speed with confirmation bias and got the story wrong. The other side looked at the actual facts (as provided by the videos) and successfully argued the truth was other than it first appeared. The “counterattack” wasn’t of the same nature as the initial attack. Why can’t Chris Cillizza see those differences?

Could it be that he doesn’t want to be the guy who writes a column saying ‘The left is really going full tilt with confirmation bias this year’ because he knows the blowback online would be swift and vicious? That possibility must have at least crossed his mind."

Smollett, a black actor, initially claimed that two white men attacked him while hurling slurs before saying “this is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

But Chicago police detectives have found little evidence supporting his story and instead arrested two Nigerian brothers who reportedly told them that Smollett paid them to stage the alleged attack.

Kevin Fallon, a reporter for the Daily Beast, initially posted two missives on Twitter criticizing Trump supporters.

“People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that [expletive] from Empire,” Fallon said in one tweet. “Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.”

In another tweet, Fallon added: “Update after learning more: they wore ski masks, so as to [sic] cowardly not be recognized as they shouted ‘this is MAGA country’ and toed [sic] a rope around his neck like a noose.”

Fallon left his tweets up for weeks after the Jan. 29 attack before finally deleting them late Feb. 18. He issued a new post, saying: “I deleted previous inaccurate tweets as more reports about Jussie Smollett come out.”

“What a despicable act if updates are true: exploiting & amplifying the hate, division, & politicization; abusing media & police resources; and making it all the harder for victims to report,” he added. Fallon did not apologize for smearing Trump and Trump supporters.

Requests sent to Daily Beast editor-in-chief Noah Shachtman, Fallon, and the Daily Beast’s parent company IAC by The Wrap were not answered.

A number of other media industry employees posted personal opinions in the wake of the alleged attack that they’ve deleted or tried to justify since new information came to light pointing to the attack being a hoax.

Zachary Kussin, a New York Post reporter called the alleged attack “unbelievably disturbing.”

“I also hate when cops investigate this kind of blatant [expletive] as a ‘possible hate crime,'” he added. “This is obviously a hate crime.”

If the issue is one in which we read an account — which, yes, is now under a big microscope — describing an African-American man who’s beaten, has a rope tied around him and is splashed with bleach, then I think the words hate and crime would immediately come to anyone’s mind — Zachary Kussin (@zacharykussin) February 18, 2019

Kussin deleted his tweets and has not issued a retraction or an apology. Responding to heavy criticism about injecting his opinion into the story, he noted that he had posted links to stories about updates in the case and added: “The number of trolls using me as a scapegoat for a story that I did not cover is frankly astonishing.”

Buzzfeed writer Ryan Schocket wrote after the alleged attack: “These are the people our president is emboldening. This is what that red hat stands for.”

He deleted the tweet and did not issue an update.

Broderick Greer, a writer for Teen Vogue and the Washington Post, wrote after the alleged attack that “The MAGA element is unsurprising. Red Hat Wearers are a threat to black LGBTQ people all over the country.”

He did not delete his tweets and has not issued an apology or a retraction.

Gina Cherelus, a reporter for Reuters, a wire agency, called the alleged attack “heartbreaking.” Her tweet remains up on her page and she has not issued an update.

Karen Attiah, an editor for The Washington Post, said, “The heinous attack on Jussie Smollett [is] yet another reminder that Trump’s ascendance and the resulting climate of hate has meant that lives have been increasingly at stake since 2015.” She added, “Smollett could have been killed by those thugs screaming MAGA. Let that sink in.”

Attiah did not delete her tweet and declined to apologize. “It would do everyone well to wait for the full facts of the case on all sides to officially come out,” she wrote in an update.

Ernest Owens, a writer for Philadelphia Magazine, wrote that the alleged attack on Smollett showed “how far we haven’t come in 2019.”

“Hoping for justice and vengeance for Jussie Smollett,” he added.

Reacting to updates in the story, he appeared on CNN and said that he felt “bamboozled, hoodwinked, and betrayed” by Smollett. He added on Twitter, “Nowadays the lines get blurred between activist, writer, and journalist. Those are three separate things that can compliment—but call for different frames of operation. You can advocate and trust—but also be [expletive] sure to verify.”

I’m not going to right now rip apart each Jussie Smollett detail, but let’s keep it real — the moment it was revealed that he knew both of those Nigerian brothers and they got immediately released after being identified — that just didn’t make sense. — Ernest Owens (@MrErnestOwens) February 19, 2019

Xeni Jardin, a writer for the Boing Boing blog, wrote after Smollett claimed he was attacked, “Donald Trump owns this. Donald Trump’s supporters own this.” She later deleted her tweet and has not issued an apology or retraction.

Mark Hughes, a contributor to Forbes, Huffington Post, and Slate, wrote on Jan. 29: “The rabid animals in MAGA hats who attacked Jussie Smollett need to be hunted down aggressively, w/o mercy, & assuming on-sight that they’re armed & an imminent threat. Drag the scum in chains to the smallest darkest hole, and throw them down it forever.”

Hughes declined to apologize and did not delete the tweet."

Per our sister site Deadline, Smollett will be “a rare presence” on the set this week as upcoming episodes undergo “serious rewrites” to reduce his scenes, while episodes already filmed will remain unchanged. (A Fox spokesperson had no comment for TVLine on the production changes.)

Smollett currently is facing further questioning by the Chicago Police Department after two persons of interest (brothers from Nigeria, one of whom worked as a personal trainer on a music video of Smollett’s) were released on Friday after additional interviews, and without being charged.

Chicago PD communications director Anthony Guglielmi said on Saturday, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police … has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Deadline in turn quoted a source as saying “the new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.”

Smollett’s lawyers issued a statement late Saturday, saying, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

As for reports that Smollett knew one or both of the Nigerian brothers, his lawyers said, “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett sought treatment at a hospital in Chicago, where Empire is filmed, following his alleged late-January attack, in which two men supposedly approached the actor/singer and began hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him. He performed at an L.A. concert days after the attack, and appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America last week to give his account of the incident, saying that he’s been “forever changed” by it."

Celebrities immediately poured out their support for Smollett and used the story as yet another excuse to blast the president and anyone who supports him.

Smollett gave a fluff interview to ABC’s “Good Morning America” and recounted the attack by two men who yelled, “MAGA [Make America Great Again] country!” He also claimed they said homophobic and racist things while putting a noose around his neck.

The investigation into Smollett’s claims has now “shifted,” according to the Chicago Police Department.

New reports suggest Smollett may have staged the entire attack. He allegedly hired two Nigerian brothers, both extras on “Empire,” to carry out the attack and to go along with his story of a hate crime.

Right about now is when public figures in the media and in the entertainment industry should be apologizing for jumping the gun so quickly and going along with a dubious narrative.

Here are five celebs who blamed the president and his supporters for the attack — and who each owe apologies (that will likely never arrive).

1.) Rosie O’Donnell. She’s one of the few stars to go back and delete her initial reaction to the Smollett story.

“Unreal — love to Jussie,” she wrote in the tweet.

MORE NEWS: NOLA Protests

She added a middle finger emoji — before adding this lovely note: “To maga a**holes.”

2.) Billy Eichner. The comedian not only bought what Smollett was selling — he was so angered he said some vicious things about President Donald Trump and his supporters.

“Heartbroken and furious reading about the attack on @JussieSmollett,” wrote Eichner. “I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in hell.”

3.) Ellen Page. During an interview on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, actress Page (above left) actually tied the alleged Smollett attack to Vice President Mike Pence.

Page said she did not know Smollett personally but supported his story. She then proceeded to rant about the president and vice president and the feelings they inspire in people.

“Connect the dots. This is what happens,” said Page. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

Check out these outrageous comments below:

4.) Rob Reiner. The director and actor (above right) has called Trump supporters racist in the past — so his reaction to the Smollett story was not much of a surprise.

“The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving. No intolerance! No DT!” he tweeted.

5.) Cher. The entertainer sent out one of her typically incoherent tweets in response to the Smollett news.

While not everything she was saying was clear, it was obvious she believed Smollett and partly blamed the president.

“Jussie Smollett, ‘Empire’ Actor, Reportedly Attacked In Possible Hate Crime. NPR. VILLAINY, RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA, PROMOTED BY MOST INFAMOUS [clown in the world], IS THE POISON THAT KILLS [America].

Evidently, Cardi B has been paying attention and offered her colorful commentary on the situation while expertly devouring lobster tails.

“So I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, or whatever the fuck his name is,” she said during an Instagram Live session. “I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro. Like damn. I’m not going to say yet until it comes out of his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged. I don’t want to completely blame him because, you know, like somebody I was talking to was like, ‘Police in Chicago are racist.’

“So, they might try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you fucked up for real. Like, why would you do that? You do’t have to do that. Then you give fuckin’ Donald Trump immunity to laugh at niggas and shit, make muthafuckas look bad. Shit breaks me bro.”

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men yelling “racial and homophobic slurs” on January 29 just outside his Chicago apartment. As cops probed for details, they reportedly discovered enough holes in his story to dive further.

Two Nigerian brothers were ultimately arrested for the alleged assault but were released without charges. Several reports suggest Smollett paid the two men to stage the attack, something the Empire actor vehemently denies."

Smollett said in an interview on Good Morning America that he is “pissed off” at people who question his narrative, and his lawyers say the actor feels “victimised” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The rapper made it clear that she doesn’t know for certain where to stand on the issue, that she “doesn’t want to completely blame [Smollett]”, and that she “wants to know” the truth.

She added that if the reports that Smollett was somehow involved in the attack are true, “then bro, you f***** up.”

“You gave f****** Donald Trump immunity to f****** laugh and make motherf****** look bad,” she said.

Last month, Smollett told police he had been attacked by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured a chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country”, an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

A spokeswoman for Smollett’s laywers told AP that Smollet’s attorneys ”will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf”.

CHICAGO -- Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn't credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the ""investigation had shifted"" following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers have said the actor was angered and ""victimized"" by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers, said they would ""keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf."" Kavanagh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men ""has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

Since then, after some accused the “Empire” actor of lying, two Nigerian brothers were arrested and released after they claimed Smollett staged the attack and paid them $3,500 each.

From the very beginning, Smollett has denied that he’s been untruthful, and at first the police backed his claims, but that’s changed since the brothers started cooperating with their investigation. It also has been learned that the two men were extras on “Empire.”

As reported, the police now want to conduct another interview with Smollett since the trajectory of the investigation has dramatically shifted. The Chicago Sun-Times reported the actor was scheduled to speak with investigators on Monday, Feb. 18, but that was shot down by a Chicago police spokesperson.

In the past few weeks, both celebrities and non-celebrities alike have weighed in on Smollett’s claim, including Cardi B, who seems frustrated with the actor.

“I’m really disappointed in him,” she said on Monday, Feb. 18, on Instagram Live. “I feel like he f—ed up Black History Month, bro. Like, damn, I’m not gonna say yet until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the sh– was staged. I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to, they said police in Chicago are racists. So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, than bro you f—-ed up, for real. Like, why would you do that?”

The director Ava DuVernay sent a tweet about Smollett as well and agreed with Cardi about Chicago police not having the best track record when it comes to having transparent investigations.

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,” she wrote on Sunday. “The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

In one of the latest updates, CBS Chicago reports that Smollett received a racist letter at “Empire’s” studio a while back and staged the attack after it didn’t get a “bigger reaction.”"

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police investigated but dismissed a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman said Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said a person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. However, he said video evidence allowed investigators to determine the report wasn’t credible.

Guglielmi said the two brothers did meet with prosecutors and police Tuesday in a Chicago courthouse. There was no immediate information about what they discussed.

Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck. Last week, Guglielmi said media reports about the attack being a hoax were unconfirmed by case detectives.

But on Saturday, police announced that the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers and their release from custody without charges. Police have requested another interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers have said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement late Saturday.

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said they would “keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.” Kavanagh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett in 2007 shows the actor pleaded no contest to giving false information to police when he was pulled over for driving while under the influence.

Court records show that Smollett was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother and signing a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license. He pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

Also Tuesday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said that she is recusing herself from the current investigation in Chicago.

“Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,” Foxx’s spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Asked who Foxx is familiar with, Simonton said Foxx would have no further comment.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, reported he was physically attacked while he was getting a sandwich around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 near his home in downtown Chicago. He said the men shouted the slurs and yelled “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett also said the attackers poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police looked through hours of video surveillance from the area but found no footage of an attack. They did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question.

On Wednesday police picked up two brothers at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria and questioned them about the attack. They also searched the apartment where the men live.

The men, who had been held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett, were released Friday. Guglielmi said the next day that information police received from the men “has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

This version of the story corrects the 4th paragraph to say that last week police said reports the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed. Corrects earlier version saying that police had declined to comment on whether it was a hoax.

A radical thought from a person paid good money to blow off his big bazoo.

But never on command. I’m fortunate in that I rarely must comment on any given situation. My boss never shifts the stump of a wet cigar in his mouth and barks, “Steinberg! Your take on the Kershpungen Kerfuffle! Online in 30 minutes!”

Not yet anyway.

OPINION

I do believe in comment, but after reflection. Time is our friend. We are allowed to think about stuff, to see what develops. We don’t have to argue every murky, fluid situation. We can just wait and find out.

I’d never heard of either Jussie Smollett or his TV show “Empire” before Jan. 29, when the young actor reported being attacked in Chicago. Such things happen — Wrigleyville is next to Boystown, and in the summer, carloads of suburban bully boys are known to assault pedestrians whose step isn’t as heavy as theirs.

But that wasn’t the situation here. It wasn’t summer; it was 20 below. And he was walking in Streeterville, not on Halsted Street. There was preparation beyond drinking a case of Old Style: a rope, and bleach. And, most incredibly, claims that this is MAGA country, which it certainly is not. Donald Trump won’t show his face here.

Nor was this any random young man on his way home from Sidetrack. This was a celebrity.

I try not to engage in Facebook tug-o-wars. Better to read and not react. But I came upon a string of comments from people horrified at this attack. Doubts were being raised and the doubters reviled. They needed support. I thought carefully, then wrote:

“This is a very strange set of facts. Not a typical Chicago crime.”

I felt safe with that. A couple days later, I came upon another friend out on a limb:

“I know many will call me an ass for not believing the victim but this story is BS,” he wrote.

To some, that was bigotry rampant.

“It saddens me that it is easier for people to find this story made up (hospital pictures of injuries, document threats and all) than see this is plausible.”

It seemed cowardly to hurry past. I weighed in:

“I have to admit, I had the exact same thought. It just seems implausible. Not impossible. But the odds of this celebrity hitting town and running into the cast of ‘Deliverance’ … let’s just say if I had to bet the ranch, it would be on Some Other Explanation.”

RELATED: Timeline of Jussie Smollett attack investigation

Since then, over the past two weeks, the story has assumed the usual pattern. Blue America waved the bloody shirt — see, this is the nest of haters we must deal with! Now that the blood appears to be ketchup, and perhaps — still perhaps, remember — Smollett cooked this up, hiring the men who supposedly assaulted him for reasons I won’t guess at — Red America had a jubilee: see, all this racism and homophobia stuff is a lie. We live in Mayberry where everybody is happy.

The core problem, ignored by both sides, has nothing to do with whatever happened to Smollett that night. The problem is that an example isn’t proof.

If I want to illustrate that America is a deeply racist country, whose economic success is built upon the dehumanization of black people, the slavers’ poisonous worldview still with us to this day, I don’t need a street incident to make my case. I can just flop open a history book to almost to any random page. Nor does the country’s pervasive homophobia, despite real advances, need to be proven by a mugging.

When the initial news was seized upon, as Exhibit No. 1 for these woes, those eagerly banging garbage can lids together were playing Trump’s game: trot out a dramatic crime then demand a wall.

When diligent police work cast the attack into question, the Revanchist Right picked up the stick the Left dropped, and made it Exhibit No. 1 for Fake News. More proof that the racism and homophobia we’ve never acknowledged in the first place does not exist.

Why does everybody do it? Cherry pick newly-baked facts that we hope will support us? It must show lack of confidence in our view of the world, this constant junkie scramble for new validation.

See why silence is so attractive? I’ve said it before: Shutting up is an art form."

In late January, Empire actor Jussie Smollett was beaten by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, and put his head in a noose — an attack that was first investigated as a violent hate crime, but quickly grew to be much more complicated. In less than a month, Chicago police dropped their investigation into the two now-identified “persons of interest,” and Smollett faced accusations of orchestrating the attack on himself, leading everyone from Cardi B to 2020 presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker to weigh in on the the case. On February 20, Smollett was named a suspect in his own attack. But then, just over a month later, all charges were dropped against Smollett — an unexpected update that shocked many of those following the case.

Below, here’s a full timeline of the whole ordeal.

January 22: Racist, homophobic letter arrives at Empire set

Less than a week before the attack, Smollett receives a racist and homophobic letter containing white powder at the Fox studio where Empire is filmed. (This letter later leads some to believe the attack was premeditated.)

﻿January 28: Smollett is attacked

﻿According to initial reports, on Monday evening, two white men wearing ski masks approach Smollett outside of a Subway in Chicago, where they beat him up, pour “an unknown chemical substance” on him, and put a noose around his neck. Per TMZ, the men also call Smollett “that f**got Empire n*****” and yell, “This is MAGA country.” (Smollett is black and openly gay.)

That night, Smollett checks into Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is reported to be in “good condition.”

January 30: Police look into “persons of interest”

﻿The Chicago Police Department releases an image of the two “potential persons of interest,” as captured by a nearby security camera.

January 31: Smollett’s family responds

﻿Smollett’s family condemns the attack in a statement, saying, “To be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.”

February 1: Smollett makes first comments following attack

﻿Smollett breaks his silence in a statement to Essence, saying, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

“More importantly, I want to say thank you,” the statement continues. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

February 2: Smollett makes first public appearance

﻿At the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood, Smollett makes his first public appearance at a sold-out show, where he opens up about his attack and says he will “always stand for love.”

“The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay,” he says. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all … And I hope that you all will stand with me.”

February 13: Two men are arrested

CPD arrests two men on suspicion of carrying out the attack against Smollett. They are later identified as Nigerian brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, who have connections to Empire. (In 2015, the former appeared as an extra.)

February 14: Good Morning America interview and the “potential persons of interest”

﻿Smollett visits the Good Morning America studio on Valentine’s Day, where he gives his first in-depth interview about what transpired the night of the attack. At this point, some were starting to question the validity of Smollett’s account, as well as why he was apprehensive about giving his phone to the police, all of which Smollett addresses on the show.

""It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth."" @JussieSmollett tells @RobinRoberts he's ""pissed off"" about the attacks on him after details came out after his attack. https://t.co/3HbyU2SFxe pic.twitter.com/a2o949itIJ — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

The same day, communications officer Anthony Guglielmi releases information about the two persons of interest.

“Police have identified the men only as two Nigerian brothers,” reads Guglielmi’s update. “Police have been questioning them since they were picked up by officers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday after returning to the city from Nigeria. On Thursday, police served a search warrant at their home.”

February 15: The two suspects are released

﻿“Due to new evidence,” CPD releases the two suspects and drops the charges against them, per a tweet from Guglielmi.

February 16: CPD sources suggest that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack

Two law-enforcement sources tell CNN that CPD believes Smollett may have paid the two men, who are now cooperating with the police, to stage the attack against him. According to the sources, CPD has records of the two released suspects purchasing the rope that was tied around Smollett’s neck.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” CPD says in a statement. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

This narrative contradicts statements that CPD made on January 14, soon after media outlets started to report the theory that Smollett staged his attack: that police had “no evidence” to suggest that Smollett fabricated details of his assault. (Smollett’s representative did not comment at this time.)

On Sunday, February 18, senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom initially condemned the attack, individually said they were reserving judgment, as details are still unfolding. “It’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,” Harris said.

February 18: Smollett’s attorneys say they will “keep an active dialogue” with CPD

While CPD says that Smollett is not a suspect at this time, the police department tells his legal team that they want to speak with him again about the night of January 29. Per Smollett’s attorneys, he denies that he had anything to do with the attack.

In an emailed statement earlier Monday, Anne Kavanaugh, a spokesperson for Smollett’s lawyers, said that his legal team “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

February 19: Smollett is cut from Empire episodes

Amid conflicting reports about the case, sources tell Deadline that Empire has slashed the yet-to-be-filmed scenes in which Smollett was set to appear. Meanwhile, CPD is still requesting that Smollett submit to an interview, but the actor’s attorneys have not yet indicated when — if ever — he will be willing to speak with police.

Later in the evening, two sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CBS Chicago that the Osundairo brothers are claiming that Smollett sent himself the racist letter that arrived at the Empire set; they also say that Smollett staged the attack after the letter didn’t spark the outcry he sought.

February 20: Call from Smollett’s attorneys delays grand jury testimony and Smollett is considered a suspect

﻿Just minutes before the Osundairo brothers are scheduled to testify in front of the Leighton Criminal Courthouse grand jury, CBS Chicago reports that Cook County State’s Attorney’s office receives a call from Smollett’s attorneys, leading prosecutors to postpone the testimony. (The specifics of the call have not yet been reported.)

On Wednesday evening, Guglielmi tweeted that Smollett is now officially considered a suspect “for filing a false police report,” and that detectives are presenting evidence before a grand jury.

In a statement to People, Smollett’s attorneys say that they planned to launch an “aggressive defense” in response to the charge.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” the statement reads. “Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

February 21: Smollett turns himself in to police custody

In the early morning, Smollett turns himself in to police custody, where he is arrested and charged with filing a false police report. (If found guilty, Smollett could serve up to three years.)

Hours later, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson holds a press briefing, where he essentially confirms all the details that anonymous sources have been leaking to the media: that Smollett orchestrated the attack because he was dissatisfied with his Empire salary on the TV series, and that he sent the threatening letter to himself.

March 8: Smollett is indicted

﻿A Cook County grand jury indicts Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct, which one of his lawyers calls “prosecutorial overkill.”

March 14: Smollett pleads not guilty

At the conclusion of the arraignment hearing, the court decides that Smollett will make his next appearance on April 17.

March 26: All criminal charges are dropped

Just over two months after the alleged hate crime, Smollett emerges from an “emergency court appearance” with shocking news: the prosecution has decided to drop all criminal charges against him; in turn, he will forfeit his bond and perform community service.

“Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him,” reads a statement from Smollett’s lawyers. “Jussie was attacked by 2 people he was unable to identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgment.”

According to a source close to Smollett, the prosecution’s case against the actor “disintegrated,” they told TMZ. And, as of this morning, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that records have been sealed, and the case has been expunged from Smollett’s record. While questions still loom over the case, in a statement released following the court appearance, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office says they believe “this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.”

April 11: Chicago sues Smollett

﻿In state court, the city of Chicago sues Smollett, accusing him of orchestrating a fake hate crime and lying to law enforcement. “Defendant made this report to the C.P.D. officers despite knowing that the purported attack was not for racist or homophobic motives,” reads the lawsuit from the city, which seeking more than $130,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation.

April 23: The Osundairo brothers sue Smollett’s lawyers

In a federal defamation lawsuit against Smollett’s legal team, the Osundairo brothers allege that the actor orchestrated the attack and that his lawyers repeatedly lied about what transpired the night of January 28.

“We have sat back and watched lie after lie being fabricated about us in the media, only so one big lie can continue to have life,” reads the brothers’ statement, which their lawyer Gloria Schmidt read at a news conference. “These lies are destroying our character and our reputation in our personal and professional lives.”"

Chicago police are investigating a tip that on the night “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reported being attacked by two masked men he was in an elevator of his apartment building with two brothers later arrested and released from custody in the probe, a department spokesman told The Associated Press Tuesday.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the person who lives in the building or was visiting someone there reported seeing the three together the night in question last month. Smollett said two masked men hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck.

Guglielmi says police haven’t confirmed the person’s account. Detectives plan to interview the person on Tuesday.

The latest updates in the ongoing Jussie Smollett case had everyone on ""The View"" talking on Tuesday morning.

Chicago police confirmed a pivot in the direction of their investigation after interviewing two Nigerian brothers, who were once suspects. ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to the press.

Two law enforcement sources also told CNN that CPD are now operating under the belief that Smollett paid the two brothers, who he knew from ""Empire,"" to orchestrate an assault on him; however this has not been confirmed by law enforcement. Attorneys for Smollett claimed that the actor felt ""victimized"" by the various media reports suggesting he may have been involved in orchestrating his own attack.

""I gotta tell you this, this entire story is so shocking, it's just so crazy, I almost think it's an episode of 'Empire,'"" guest cohost Ana Navarro said this morning. After pointing to Smollett's activism in both the LGBTQ and African-American communities, Naravvo added that, ""assuming that this is a hoax,' the ""plot twist is something that is so appalling."" She also said she couldn't ""think of anything that's more hurtful to real victims coming forward than somebody making up a story.""

Abby Huntsman agreed with that last sentiment. ""Do you know how hard it makes it to people that do experience real hate crimes"" she asked, before wondering how Jussie could possibly ""recover"" if the allegations end up being true.

""I've interviewed him several times, he's a friend to the show. I tweeted out originally, my prayers for him, what is happening in our world,"" said Sunny Hostin. ""Now, if this is true, I'm embarrassed to have believed him, to have supported him. I'm disgusted because I spent my entire career trying to protect victims and false reports are generally very low, somewhere between 2-10%, so how difficult is it going to be for the victims of a sex crime, a hate crime to come forward?""

Hostin added that if the developments do pan out, she hopes Smollett ""gets counseling,"" before both she and Meghan McCain said the alleged hoax would be a huge loss to the Chicago Police Department's resources at a time they could be investigating other crimes.

""If this does in fact be true, it's a grave and intense waste of all of Chicago's resources,"" said McCain. ""I also believe he is a sociopath if this ends up being the case."""

Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) in a Tuesday morning email blast. ""Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.""

Welcome to the Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.

Already, most of the prominent Democratic candidates have been campaigning far to the left of most Democrats in recent elections or their own former selves. A large part of this can be attributed to Sanders' success in 2016 and the momentum for democratic socialism that it ushered in.

Sanders' entry into the campaign could cause some of them to pull back, or to go further left, to stand out. So far, Sen. Amy Klobuchar* (Minn.) has been the only one making an appeal for the unclaimed middle ground.

Klobuchar seems willing to say one word that often goes unspoken by presidential candidates: No. From Medicare for all to the Green New Deal to free college, she's resisted the urge to pander as she tests the balance between pragmatism and purity. #KlobucharTownHall — Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) February 19, 2019

Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is rolling out a plan for a massive new entitlement program:

Elizabeth Warren is about to unveil a universal child care plan… • It's free for families 7%, however many kids they have • Financed by wealth taxhttps://t.co/v7oCPtiVLf — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) February 19, 2019

(What's a ""wealth tax,"" you ask? More here.)

Asked about his age, Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that ""we have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for."" Here's Sanders' video announcement:

FREE MINDS

""It's not accurate to say, 'This sort of thing almost always turns out to be a hoax,' and it's also not accurate to say, 'This sort of thing almost never turns out to be a hoax.'"" National Review's Jim Geraghty addresses actor Jussie Smollett's alleged hate crime, which police now suspect he faked. ""The way we measure hate crimes is imperfect; more police agencies are collecting data and providing it to the FBI than in the past, making year-to-year comparisons,"" he notes.

Nearly 1,000 police agencies started providing data to the FBI in 2017 who weren't in 2016. Last year many news organizations reported hate crimes ""increased by 17 percent"" but we don't know how much of that represents the crimes occurring more frequently or simply more extensive data collection.

Still, many progressives are convinced that that we've seen a huge spike in hate crimes since Donald Trump was elected. Of course, many conservatives see similarly delusional spikes in immigrant crime, notes Geraghty. And on both sides, people are willing to go to extreme lengths to validate people's fears.

What happened?



On Monday, Gutfeld and the other hosts criticized the media for the way it reported Smollet's alleged racially motivated attack.

Smollett said he was attacked in freezing temperatures about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 in Chicago by two unidentified men. Smollett, a star on Fox's ""Empire"" show, said that the physical attack was racially motivated, and the two men were apparent Trump supporters.

After an investigation, police revealed that it no longer consider Smollett the victim of an attack and have indicated that Smollett orchestrated the ""attack"" himself. The media went wild with stories and theories about the attack since Smollett filed a police report on the alleged incident, blaming Republicans, conservatives, Trump supporters, and more for the purported climate that caused the alleged attack.

The ""Empire"" actor has yet to admit having a role in planning the incident.

As a result of the news media's coverage, Gutfeld said that Smollett's story was unlikely from the get-go.

""Shall we call it on Smollett?"" Gutfeld asked. ""The police no longer consider Jussie Smollett a victim. Queue faces covered in egg.

""Sure,"" he added, ""the idea of Trumpers wandering in subzero Chicago at 2 a.m. carrying bleach and a noose, attacking some actor from a show they don't even watch without taking his phone, wallet, or sandwich, seemed about as real as me joining 'The View.'""

Gutfeld went on to point out that Smollett was an ideal victim for the liberal outrage media.



""But Smollett was the perfect victim for a media that deems any skepticism heresy,"" he added. ""That's why these hoaxes are not rare. It's the press orgy that attracts them.""

Gutfeld also added that he's happy that the truth came out.

""[It] once again proves we are less racist than the media wants us to be,"" he explained.

Anything else?

Later in the segment, Jesse Watters added that Smollett expressed a terminal arrogance in the way he proceeded with reporting the alleged attack.

""How stupid did [Smollett] think the police were?"" he asked. ""What low opinion of police do you have to have to be able to try to pull this off?""



Watters added, ""The media's not even looking for truth anymore. They're just looking for a story. They get a good story and weaponize it against Republicans. It's not a political hate crime, and that's when you're motivated by hatred for Republicans to frame them."""

Sources close to production told TMZ, Smollett was set to have a large presence, including a musical number, in the final episodes of the current season, but a large number of those scenes have been cut and Smollett's presence in the scenes that remain have been reduced through multiple revisions.

Police opened a hate crime investigation Jan. 29 after Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed he was assaulted by two white men who shouted racial slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. Smollett also said the men told him this was ""MAGA country,"" a reference to President Trump's ""Make America great again"" slogan.

Recent reports citing police sources say that Smollett may have paid two Nigerian-American brothers to disguise themselves and commit the attack for reasons unknown. The two brothers have released a statement through their lawyer claiming they are not ""anti-Trump"" and they have both been released by police without charges.

Chicago police say they want to conduct a second interview with Smollett. Although one of his lawyers said he declined to meet with authorities on Monday, they intend to maintain an open dialogue with police on his behalf.

The Los Angeles Times interviewed three current and former chorus members who said Duran behaved inappropriately towards them. They say when they reported the actions to the chorus membership committee, leadership sat on their hands.

One chorus member, 23-year-old Jason Tong said he quit the chorus after Duran allegedly slipped his hand inside the waistband of his underwear before a show, which Tong says was “a traumatic and shocking experience.”

Duran has denied the allegations, along with a slew of other sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him by members of the City Council.

Sources who spoke with the New York Post’s Page Six said Smollett, 35, insisted on making a TV appearance to recount the alleged January 29 incident. A source with close knowledge of the show’s booking decisions described the actor as being “adamant” about having the interview.

Moreover, sources told The Blast that some ABC staffers who were present during the “Good Morning America” interview were incredulous about his claims and felt the truth surrounding the story was “up in the air.” Staff allegedly floated the idea of Smollett’s story being fabricated as soon as he left the interview.

The Blast reported that Smollett’s side approached “Good Morning America” about the televised sit-down, specifically requesting Robin Roberts as she appeared on an episode of “Empire” in April of last year.

As previously reported, Smollett’s accused of paying Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, extras on the Fox series, to arrange the attack.

The black, openly gay actor reportedly told police that two masked assailants asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” moments before the assault outside of a Chicago Subway restaurant. He allegedly said the suspects then tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid on him before fleeing the scene.

Roberts has since defended her February 14 interview with Smollett in light of allegations that the actor orchestrated his own attack.

“When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night (February 12) in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” the anchor said on air Monday, according to Just Jared.

“At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

Major national outlets have now confirmed local reports that Chicago PD now believe that Jussie Smollett paid two acquaintances to fake the attack.

This is of course a cause for celebration. A violent hate crime did not occur. The United States is not yet so hopeless and divided that modern-day lynchings are being carried out in the president's name mere feet away from fast food establishments in a major city.

Alas, the AP reports, ""some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment."" Wow, conservatives are no longer just pouncing and seizing, we're doing it ""gleefully"" now!

Conservative pundit and CNN commentator S.E. Cupp leveled a similar criticism. ""The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross,"" tweeted Cupp. ""This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics,""

I understand that reaction. It's perfectly acceptable to feel betrayed and shocked to learn that the person you supported as a victim was in fact a criminal.

But for the bulk of conservatives, that wasn't their experience with this story. They read headlines and tweets saying that people like them had attacked a gay black man in explicitly racist and homophobic terms, with nary an ""alleged"" in sight. They had to watch sitting members of Congress say that ""The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is killing & hurting our people"" and that the president they supported was personally to blame. They had to read magazine pieces about how ""The Racist, Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett Is Far-Right America's Endgame.""

Trump supporters weren't just vindicated, they were acquitted. You may as well somberly tell a man who has been found innocent of murder that he should not take joy in that fact nor shame his accusers. Why not take a victory lap?

I can't help but to suspect that many of those who are despondent about the news that Smollett faked the attack are motivated by more than just a sense of betrayal. They're embarrassed, for one; some of them look like fools. But there's also the far more nefarious urge to believe the worst of your opponents, and resent the fact that they aren't as bad as you suspected.

C.S. Lewis has a great quote in Mere Christianity that sums up this phenomenon better than I ever could:

Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one's first feeling, ‘Thank God, even they aren't quite so bad as that,' or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything — God and our friends and ourselves included — as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.

The Washington Post‘s Nana Efua Mumford admitted as much in a recent column. ""I wanted to believe Smollett,"" she writes, while confessing she doubted his story from the start. ""I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list."" She continues:

If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ""fake news."" And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting.

It's a troubling admission. Evidently she would've preferred that a violent, racist hate crime actually occurred than it not occurred. For all her talk of supporting ""victims,"" she never actually gave a damn about Smollett's supposed injuries, just the ammunition they provided in furthering a narrative. When it turned out that he lied to police, the real crime wasn't, you know, the crime, but furthering her opponents' narratives.

For people who immediately expressed skepticism at Smollett's story (myself included) and kept up tweets saying so under pressure and criticism (uh, myself not included), there is a sense of vindication. For those who believed him, there's an understandable desire to begrudge the I-told-you-sos. But the larger story here is that a horrific crime did not occur, and a far pettier crime did. That's news everyone should welcome."

Feb 19, 2019 • Post A Comment

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who reported that he was the victim of an apparent hate crime in Chicago on Jan. 29, may have staged the attack because he was upset at the lukewarm reaction to a racist letter that was sent to the show’s studio the previous week, according to CBS 2 in Chicago.

CBS 2 (WBBM -TV) investigator Brad Edwards quotes a source saying: “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.”

The report adds that other sources “corroborated that information.”

The letter, which was received Jan. 22 at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, targeted Smollett with racial and homophobic threats, the report notes. The letter, which contained a white powder and prompted a HAZMAT response, is being investigated by the FBI. The powder reportedly turned out to be aspirin.

“The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville,” CBS 2 reports. “De Mar spoke on the phone exclusively with the Osundairo brothers Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: ‘We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.’”

The station posted a photo of the Jan. 22 letter, which you can see by clicking here."

Amid the twists and turns of the investigation into the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett, the actor’s screen time on the Fox hit is being cut back.

Over the weekend, Chicago PD confirmed to EW that new evidence has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” with many outlets reporting that Smollett is now suspected of orchestrating the attack against him. Now, as Empire films its final few episodes of season 5, EW has learned that many of Smollett’s scenes are being rewritten and reduced.

While Fox had no comment when reached by EW, upcoming episodes are reportedly undergoing “serious rewrites” to reduce dramatic scenes and musical performances centered on Smollett’s Jamal Lyon.

This comes two days after Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney went on Twitter to defend the actor, saying, “I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett. Keep your head up.”

Reports last week that Smollett staged the apparent racial and homophobic attack because he was being killed off of Empire were quickly shot down by Fox and the entire creative team. All that being said, Empire‘s big season 5 story line has been centered on a flash forward and a mystery death.

When Jussie Smollett first claimed to have been attacked by two white men who recognized him as a star of “Empire” at 2 a.m. during a polar vortex in Chicago and yelled racial, homophobic, and pro-Trump slurs at him, Sharpton was all in.

“For Jussie, who’s not only a superb actor and singer but an activist who has fought against homophobia and racism and sexism, to be a victim is something that is totally unacceptable,” he told TMZ as soon as the attack was reported. “I challenge the Chicago law enforcement to do all within their power to find out those that are guilty and they should face the maximum penalty of law.”

Sharpton now says that Smollett should “face accountability to the maximum” if he did, indeed, perpetrate a hoax.

“I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said Sunday night during his MSNBC program, “Politics Nation,” according to Page Six. Notice how he left out that he immediately called Smollett a “victim” even though the reported facts of the crime didn’t make sense even initially. Still, Sharpton pressed on.

“I still maintain that,” Sharpton said. “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

Yes, Smollett absolutely should face accountability if reports that the whole thing was a hoax turn out to be true. He probably won’t, however, as those who perpetrate the most famous hoaxes rarely, if ever, face consequences.

Sharpton himself has escaped consequences for the role he played in one of the most famous rape and race hoaxes in modern American history.

In 1987, teenager Tawana Brawley claimed she was raped by a group of white men who wrote racial slurs on her body, smeared her with feces and wrapped her in a plastic bag. Sharpton jumped to her defense, and the case not only inflamed racial tensions in the U.S., but also launched his career as a prominent race-baiter.

Brawley named several prominent men as her attackers — including a former assistant district attorney — and while they suffered greatly, she only started paying defamation damages six years ago after her employer was ordered to garnish her wages.

As for Sharpton, he was also ordered to pay $65,000 in defamation damages, but the money was paid back by his supporters, after he refused to pay for years.

So, in summary: How has Sharpton “faced accountability” for his actions in perpetrating a race and rape hoax? He has his own show on MSNBC, is still asked for comment on issues of race, and had his friends pay off the debts he accrued from perpetrating a hoax.

Chicago police seem willing to hold Smollett accountable for a hoax. Maybe his friends will take the hit for him, like Sharpton’s did. Or maybe he’ll be forgiven because even though he may have lied, he lied about the right people and himself falls into the right categories of intersectional victimhood."

The reason “hate” hoaxes are being promoted so frequently, and so readily believed by progressives, Lewis suggests, is that victimhood has now eclipsed heroism and success in cultural cachet.

“Once upon a time, fakers posed as heroes and winners,” writes Lewis; the reason, of course, is that our culture valued them. Now, Americans — including Smollett, apparently — want to be viewed as victims.

“Smollet’s story appears ready to join Duke Lacrosse and the University of Virginia rape in a long line of hoaxes that many media outlets and political leaders were quick to fall for because it fit their preferred narrative,” Lewis writes. “It’s not enough that Donald Trump is a bad president, we are hell-bent on the idea that he has lit the match of hatred that incites and inspires violence. This theory explains why we were quick to believe the worst about those smirking white, MAGA hat-wearing Covington kids, and it’s why we were quick to believe the Smollett story, too.”

While Lewis expresses some sympathy for this gullibility as it relates to stories that align with this left-wing narrative, he sounds the alarm over how politicians and media types repeatedly exposing their bias and blindspots is going to play out in the future.

“It is easy to understand the psychological reasons why 21st century poseurs cast themselves as the injured party,” he writes. “What’s more difficult to comprehend is why an already-struggling media industry is so ready to alienate half the country, and reinforce Donald Trump’s dangerous line about the ‘fake news’ media in the process.”

Citing the “overt political pressure” prompting people who should know better to rush to conclusions in support of their agenda and prove they are “sufficiently woke,” Lewis provides some damning examples in the Smollett debacle. Both progressive writers and politicians began “‘working the refs,’ taking to Twitter to shame law enforcement and journalists for using supposed weasel words like ‘alleged’ or ‘racially charged.'”

Among those who came out to condemn the supposedly “hate”-inspired “lynching” of Smollett were several Democratic presidential candidates, including Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cory Booker, who, since the story has begun to unravel, are now suddenly calling on folks to wait till all the evidence comes out — exactly like they failed to do in the first place.

“Jussie Smollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” wrote Harris in a tweet that hasn’t aged well. “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it,” declared Gillibrand. “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching,” concluded Booker, who now says he’s waiting for the evidence.

All of this irresponsible promotion of fake “hate” is perfectly playing to Trump’s advantage. Read Lewis’ full column here.

Many people who showed their support for Smollett and condemnation for Trump supporters after news first broke have now walked back their tweets and comments.

“I deleted previous inaccurate tweets as more reports about Jussie Smollett come out,” Kevin Fallon, a senior entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast, tweeted. “What a despicable act if updates are true: exploiting & amplifying the hate, division, & politicization; abusing media & police resources; and making it all the harder for victims to report.”

According to TMZ, his screen time on the second to the last episode of the season is “getting slashed,” as production points to the new evidence that Smollett orchestrated his own attack.

Originally, the hit series’ star was scheduled to appear in nine scenes and perform one big musical number in the second to last episode. Sources tell TMZ that five of the scenes and the musical have been slashed. It actually appears that the entire script has been changed. The four scenes that he is in are ensembles and do not feature him as a primary character to the narrative.

This is probably best as the production has to shift the attention from the press discombobulation that is currently attached to Smollett.

Smollett is an original cast member of Empire. He plays Jamal Lyons, the show’s primary male R&B singer, who has to come to terms with sexuality within the toxically masculine family dynamic that his father promotes.

While taping the current season, Smollett reported that he was attacked late night while going to Subways for a snack. The attack was allegedly by two men that yelled “MAGA Country” at him, as well as racial and homophobic slurs. In addition to the beating, the attackers allegedly poured substance that smelled like bleach and hung a noose around his neck. Many were outraged at the attack and took to social media to protest. As the investigation progressed, doubts started to emerge and his story was questioned by critics, fans and law enforcement. Chicago police even questioned two African men, who claim that they were paid to stage an attack."

Rapper Cardi B posted a profanity-filled Instagram live video expressing disappointment in Smollett, while leaving open the possibility that the actor is being set up by “racist” police officers.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT HAS 'NO PLANS' TO MEET WITH CHICAGO POLICE MONDAY, DESPITE REQUEST

“I’m not gonna say, yet, until he says out his mouth that it was fake and the s--- was staged. I don’t want to completely blame him because… somebody that I was talking to, they said police in Chicago are racist and so they might probably be trying to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar,” Cardi B said in the video. “But if he’s not, then bro, you f----d up.”

Much like Cardi B, actress Ava DuVernay is skeptical of law enforcement in Chicago.

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,” DuVernay tweeted. “The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

DuVernay sent a follow-up tweet after a fan pointed out inconsistencies in Smollett’s version of events.

“He might have lied. He might [...] not have. I don’t know. But what I do know? I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so,” she wrote.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS DENY HE PLANNED ATTACK AFTER CHICAGO POLICE CLAIM HE'S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A VICTIM IN CASE

On Saturday, a Chicago police spokesperson said Smollett is no longer considered a victim in the case that allegedly involved an attack by two masked men who shouted racial and anti-gay slurs at the actor and ""This is MAGA country!""

Police earlier said that the ""trajectory of the investigation"" shifted and that they wanted to conduct another interview with Smollett about the alleged hate crime last month. Police released two Nigerian brothers who were held for questioning about the reported attack. They were released late Friday without charges.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said he was attacked on Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. Police initially said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and earlier considered Smollett a victim.

Over the weekend, reports citing police sources who felt Smollett orchestrated the attack gained traction, with CNN leading the charge. Actress Alyssa Milano tweeted that staging an attack is “wrong in so many ways” before expressing difficulty believing Smollett would do such a thing.

“No one could be that hurtful? To stage this? Right?” she wrote. “To f--k with all of us by playing into our weaknesses & make it even harder for victims to come forward?! No one could choose to be that hurtful? Right?! RIGHT?”

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, vehemently denied that the attack was a hoax, previously telling press, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett, who stars on Fox’s “Empire,” told Chicago police last month that he was assaulted by two men who beat him, placed a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. The Chicago Police Department had said to ITK in a statement that it was investigating the alleged attack as a “possible hate crime” after Smollett told them the men screamed racial and homophobic slurs at him.

But authorities now believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack against himself and paid two men to stage it, CNN reported Sunday, citing police sources.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" a Chicago Police spokesman said on Saturday.

“Like damn,” Cardi B said of the Smollett case.

“I’m not going to say yet, until he say out of his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged,” she continued, before suggesting without evidence that there was a possibility that Smollett was being “framed” to “make it look like he’s a liar.”

The 36-year-old “Empire” actor and singer alleged that he was attacked in Chicago by two individuals at a Subway on a late January night. His attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs, beat him, put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance over him.

The attackers, who are brothers from Nigeria and were also hired as extras on Smollett’s show, were released without charges on Friday and are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

With backlash quickly forming against Smollet’s hate-crime hoax, his attorneys issued a statement denying the latest development. (RELATED: Here’s A List Of Hoax ‘Hate Crimes’ In The Trump Era)

Production sources tell TMZ that the 36-year-old actor was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical performance in the second-to-last episode of Season 5, which is currently being shot. However, five of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been nixed.

Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, is no longer the focus of the remaining four scenes, which will now feature an ensemble of cast members.

As a result, Jussie will be spending far less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, he will only be working Friday and possibly Thursday, and won’t be rehearsing. “Empire” writers have been scrambling to revise the script over the last 24 hours.

Smollett claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack on Jan. 29 that left him beaten and covered in bleach with a rope around his neck. Two men were questioned by police last week, saying they were paid to help stage the assault near Smollett’s Chicago apartment.

The case will now head to a grand jury as early as today. Smollett could be charged with a felony indictment for allegedly filing a false police report.

Smollett and his lawyers have denied the attack was staged. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said his attorneys in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”"

Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until it’s completed.

Speaking Monday to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, during her first presidential campaign trip to the state, the U.S. senator from California says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” Police in Chicago say their investigation into the report that the actor was attacked by two men yelling slurs has “shifted” after two brothers were questioned and released. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The Presidents Day holiday weekend brought Harris and other Democratic presidential candidates to New Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020. Also campaigning in the Granite State were Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota."

That's the question many are asking as mounting evidence points to a hoax.

One Los Angeles-based civil rights activist believes Smollett's alleged hoax is endangering the very community he is a part of — which is why he should be arrested and prosecuted.

What did the activist say?

""Today, Project Islamic HOPE is calling upon the arrest and criminal prosecution of 'Empire' star and actor Jussie Smollett. We believe Jussie Smollett lied about being the victim of a hate crime and being assaulted, and for us, it's a slap in the face,"" Najee Ali said Sunday.

Ali went on to say:

Jussie Smollett put people's lives at risk and could have created a situation that was much more damaging for those who are African American and for those who do identify with the LGBTQ community. We have many members of the black community and the LGBT community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crime — and we believe that is a lie — certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes.

""Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying,"" Ali declared, adding that Smollett's ""campaign of lies"" eroded the ""benefit of the doubt"" he was given when he first claimed he was attacked.



Ali pointed out that one, among the many numerous problems with orchestrating a hate crime hoax, is that ""more extreme"" members of the communities Smollett belongs to could have retaliated against those Smollett accused of attacking him, namely white supporters of President Donald Trump.

""Smollett could have created a race war!"" Ali exclaimed.

Ali said that Smollett is due forgiveness if he apologies for lying. However, he emphasized that ""at the end of the day,"" Smollett ""must be held accountable"" and brought to justice because he ""put many lives in danger.""

Could Smollett face jail time?

While Chicago detectives have not yet confirmed Smollett orchestrated the attack against himself, new evidence points to a hoax. While lying is not a crime, Smollett filed a police report testifying to his claims. If it is confirmed Smollett lied, he could be charged with filing a false police report.

Under Illinois criminal code, filing a false police report is considered a disorderly conduct offense chargeable by a Class 4 felony. In Illinois, Class 4 felonies carry a one- to three-year prison sentence.

Meanwhile, there is the question of the racist letter Smollett received one week before the alleged Jan. 29 attack containing a white powered substance, which turned out to be aspirin. According to WBBM-TV, Smollett may have staged the attack because the letter did not generate the response he thought it should have.

It's not clear who sent the letter, although Chicago police collected evidence from the apartment of two Nigerian brothers who allegedly helped Smollett orchestrate his hoax that may indicate the letter was also a hoax.

The FBI is handling the investigation into the letter, WBBM reported.

While questions swirl around Jussie Smollett's recent attack, I can't help but to look at the facts and think Jussie may be lying. Here are some new facts:

Smollett initially told police that he was attacked by two men outside a Subway restaurant in Chicago during the early morning hours of January 29th. The 36-year-old actor, who is openly gay, described the assailants as white men wearing ski masks, who asked Smollett if he was “that f***ot Empire n*****?” before attacking him with a rope and bleach. As they fled the scene the men yelled, “This is MAGA country!” according to Smollett.

Well, according to a close source to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) that tells ""Lenox and the Second City"" exclusively, Smollett was scheduled to appear for an interview yesterday, Feb, 19th, but did not show. And, in addition, the CPD source confirms that the letter Smollett received containing a wh ite powder substance (which was later determined to be aspirin) on Jan. 22nd that was mailed to his Chicago home was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines, the source says a magazine was taken as evidence when Smollett's Chicago home was searched last week with missing letters cut out.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information.

Yesterday, a Grand jury assembled in Smollett's investigation where police believe he rehearsed an attack. The grand jury will soon hear testimony over allegations that the Empire actor filed a false police report.

Olabinjo a nd Abimbola Osundairo, the two Nigerian brothers and Empire extras who say they conspired with Smollett to orchestra the attack, will testify before the grand jury later this week, TMZ reports. The Osundairo brothers say they rehearsed the attack with Smollett in the days prior. They told police that they scouted a location where they believed a camera would capture the attack. As of this yesterday, the two brothers are no longer suspects in this case, according to the Chicago Police Department.

In a statement released over the weekend, Smollett’s lawyers said their client “is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.” The statement continued, “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

But, is he lying?

Listen, I adore Smollett and continue to follow his career and has admired his activism; but this. isn't. adding. up.

First, I can't get my head around two Black guys putting a noose around another Black person's neck...it doesn't make sense for many reasons. Furthermore, one of his is ""attackers"" is his personal trainer, and I hear that there's a new album on the horizon in March for him. It just all screams publicity stunt.

This apparent media stunt that seems be taken out of an episode of FOX's Empire show really disappoints me. And, I know a lot of people will say things like ' we don't know everything yet and ya know white people love to jump down and lynch black people without a full story - i'd say too soon,' but the facts are right in front in our face. When I just think about this, I immediately get this ""WTF"" emoji-face drawn on me.

Comedian and close friend to Smollet, Sampson McCormick, said "" I really have no idea what’s going on, all I know is that he’s a friend and I will support him and keep him lifted in love and prayer. Reports are conflicting and it’s a lot to keep up with, but I’m praying it all works out.""

I hope I'm wrong. I really do. Because at the end of the day, I'm rooting for him; always have. He's become one of our community's role models, and I would hate to see that title taken away.

Jussie, it's time to tell the truth...the blatant truth. Even it hurts."

Mr. Smollett is no longer considered a “victim” by the Chicago Police Department: reports suggest the actor paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the apparently staged attack on him in downtown Chicago on January 29 after a threatening letter, notably with a “MAGA” reference, he received in the mail did not get enough attention.

In addition to charges Smollett might face for possibly reporting a fake hate crime attack, whoever sent that threatening letter to Smollett could reportedly face five years behind bars.

According to The Blast‘s sources, the charge behind the mailed letter would qualify as “mailing threatening communication.” Here’s the language for such a violation (18 U.S. Code § 876. Mailing threatening communications), per Cornell Law School (emphasis added):

Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication with or without a name or designating mark subscribed thereto, addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

According to CWB Chicago, the threatening letter addressed to Smollett was dropped in a mailbox in Chicago’s southwest suburbs on January 18; the letter reached the actor four days later.

“The envelope was addressed in childlike scrawl to Empire TV star Jussie Smollett at Cinespace Studios, a West Side production facility that the Fox program calls home. ‘MAGA’ — the acronym for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ — was sloppily written in the return address space,” reports CWB Chicago, adding: “Something about the envelope must have raised concerns. Smollett would later tell police that he and Empire’s executive producer donned gloves before they opened it and exposed themselves to a threat letter covered in white powder. Police logged the time as 2:30 p.m.”

There was white powder inside the letter — later identified as crushed Tylenol — and a drawing of a curly-haired stick-figure being hanged with a noose by another stick-figure. The letter also said, “You will die black f**,” in cutout letters from magazines.

On January 29, Smollett claimed he was attacked by two white Trump supporters yelling about “MAGA country” and calling him a “n*****” and a “f*****.” The actor claimed he was also kicked in the ribs by his attackers and, notably, they put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

“Headed by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office, the terroristic threat investigation is being assisted by one of America’s oldest and most underestimated law enforcement agencies: The United States Postal Inspection Service,” CWB reported. “Whoever sent the letter to Smollett may have considered the mail to be an untraceable way to deliver a message. They’d be mistaken.”

The Daily Mail reports that filing a false police report in Illinois is a Class 4 felony: “That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison.”

“By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who ‘transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed,’” the outlet notes."

The Hollywood actor and singer was allegedly attacked around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, January 29, by two men wearing ski masks who began yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

It was learned the attackers of the Empire star placed a noose around his neck after which they began to punch him and then pour an unknown substance on him screaming:

“This is MAGA country.”

However, a report surfaced on Monday claiming that the actor might have staged the attack himself.

Jussie’s case is heading to a Grand Jury as there are reports that he planned with two Nigerian brothers to attack him then filed a false police report.

According to TMZ, Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode, which is being shot now but five of his scenes have been cut and his musical number has been canceled."

Al Sharpton said Jussie Smollett ought to face “accountability to the maximum” if it turns out he staged the attack against him.

“I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said Sunday on his MSNBC program, ""Politics Nation.""

“I still maintain that,” he continued. “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.""

Sharpton went on to say that the new developments, which point to Smollett setting up the attack, shouldn’t be dismissed as a “left-wing hoax,” noting that many on the left and right, including President Trump, denounced the attack as initially reported.

Smollett claimed he was beaten in Chicago by two white men who threw a chemical substance on him and put a noose around his neck, with one yelling “this is MAGA country.” That story has since fallen apart, as Matt recaps:

The ""Empire"" actor has denied the new developments.

Just as soon as the ""Empire"" actor claimed, without evidence, that he had been attacked by two Trump supporters in Chicago because of his skin color and sexual orientation, news outlets ran with the story. It wasn't until days later that evidence came to light and police began to question Smollett's narrative. New proof suggests Smollett hired two Nigerian brothers to ""attack"" him. One of the brothers was an extra on ""Empire.""

You'd think the same outlets would've learned from another recent reporting faux pas. A group of Covington Catholic High School students were smeared based on one student's ""smirk"" at a Native American veteran in Washington, D.C. Later we learned it was the veteran who instigated the incident.

If you ask CNN's Brian Stelter, however, his network and other news outlets are not to blame for stoking the Smollett scandal. Stelter's colleague Alisyn Camerota noted she was surprised how folks in the media took Smollett's side before there were even any photos or police statements. Stelter agreed, yet tried to vindicate the media. It's the ""Twitter people"" who rushed to judgment, he said.

""There was a rush to judgment,"" Stelter said on Monday. ""I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was really careful reporting by news organizations.""



""But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day,"" he added. ""It all gets lumped in together in the minds of many people who now look at this and say what went wrong here? And obviously, at the end of the day, what went wrong is that he may have made it up and ultimately, that's his responsibility.""

If you ask Matt, he has a much different perspective on the media's role in reporting on this alleged hate crime. He highlights Steve Krakauer's analysis of the media's conclusion jumps. Krakauer considers, for instance, the pointed adjectives outlets used or omitted in their headlines.

Well, it turns out that it was two Nigerian brothers. They were considered persons of interest, then suspects, then arrested as such, and later released without charge. One of them was an extra on Empire on Fox, which stars Smollett. Then, they said they rehearsed the alleged assault, were reportedly paid by Smollett, who even bought the rope for the attack. Of course, in the era of Trump, the liberal media pounced. And guess what they were totally wrong. The worst part is that they tried to divert blame, saying celebrities and the entertainment media were the ones peddling the assault story as a fact.

And as Caleb Howe at Mediaite noted, it simply isn’t true that the celebrity media was the only cohort spreading this story, it was members of the media who contribute to The Huffington Post, LA Times, Glamour, Slate, Cosmopolitan, BuzzFeed, Reuters, Philadelphia Magazine, Newsweek, Daily Beast, and The New York Post:

On CNN’s Reliable Sources, Vox’s Liz Plank emphatically made this point, saying she couldn’t find “a real reputable media outlet reporting” that the attack was motivated by MAGA or included a statement about “MAGA country. “I couldn’t find one,” she said. “We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.” This is a fine idea, and there should be some distinction when referring to the media at large, but in this case the facts simply don’t bear out the premise that the press was not involved in an early pile-on. In fact, dozens of reporters Tweeted these very things, on the day the story broke.

Howe lists the examples from the outlets cited above. The media owns this mess, and this isn’t the first time too. There have been multiple hate crime hoaxes post-2016. And every time, the media seems to fall for it in their pathetic crusade against the Trump White House.

As a result of these developments, Chicago Police want Smollett to come in for another interview. The problem is that the actor hasn’t made the time. I wonder why."

This is why actor Jussie Smollett reportedly staged his own hate crime. Apparently, Smollett was the recipient of a racist letter containing a white powder, later determined to be aspirin, on January 22 that didn’t get enough attention. So, he reportedly orchestrated his own assault in sub-zero temperatures that was executed on January 29. He allegedly hired two Nigerian brothers to do it. They bought the rope that was tied around his neck (allegedly). They even held rehearsals…allegedly. But seriously, this reportedly was over a letter?

Via Daily Beast:

Empire” actor Jussie Smollett reportedly staged an attack against himself in late January after a “racist” letter sent to the TV show’s studio, which contained a white powder, did not get a “bigger reaction,” according to a local Chicago news station. A source told CBS Chicago the actor allegedly “concocted” the “staged” Jan. 29 attack and paid his “acquaintances”—brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo—over $3,000 to carry it out. Smollett reportedly opened the letter on Jan. 22 at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, and the white powder prompted a HAZMAT team to respond. Chicago Police Department told the news station that the substance turned out to be asprin. Cinespace Studios would not comment to The Daily Beast about the incident. Fox, ""Empire's"" network, also declined to provide comment or confirmation. […] The Osundairo brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said “all the facts will reveal themselves” in due time. “At the end of the day my clients are honest and credible,” she told CBS Chicago. Initially, Smollett claimed two white men attacked him on the streets of Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29. One attacker allegedly wore a red hat while yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him, and the other poured bleach and tied a rope around Smollett’s neck. On a Feb. 14 appearance on “Good Morning America,” Smollett reiterated the racial overtones of the alleged attack “They called me a f-----t, they called me a n----r,” he said. “There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.” It was previously reported by CBS Chicago at least one of the brothers allegedly purchased a rope “at Smollett’s request” from a hardware store on Jan. 25, and the brothers rehearsed the attack with Smollett days before it took place. The news station also reported that a red hat was also purchased at a neighborhood beauty supply store.

“The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action. ... What he didn’t know was the camera faced the other direction.” https://t.co/4QW62wy3D0 — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) February 19, 2019

The brothers knew Smollett. One was an extra on Empire and the other was his former personal trainer. Smollett allegedly offered them least $3,500 to partake in this…scheme. As stated, the initial report was that Smollett was attacked by two white men, who punched him, poured bleach on him, and placed a rope around his neck while hurling racist and homophobic slurs at him.

What a mess. What a grade-A mess. We’ll see how this angle pans out, but it does play into the ethos of liberal America.

They will make you care. Just remember that. There is no neutral faction in the war against America. They will make you care, force themselves into whatever politically neutral space you adore and poison it to force your hand. Given how anti-Trump hysteria has doled out some serious insanity since 2016, this wouldn’t shock me if it turns out to be true. At the same time, we can all marvel in how pathetic this whole affair has become. It’s sad. And we can thank the anti-Trump, opposition media for spreading it like the measles. Oh, and now it's horrible that those evil conservatives are celebrating...that a hate crime didn't happen. This is America in 2019.

Chicago Police are now requesting a follow-up interview with the Empire actor, following the confession of Smollett's alleged accomplices. A pair of Nigerian brothers, at least one of whom has known ties to the so-called ""victim"" and his television show, have reportedly told authorities that Smollett paid them to stage an attack. Officials confronted the pair with evidence of their purchase of rope and red baseball caps, prompting them to point the finger back at Smollett, claiming that he even requested a dry run-style ""rehearsal"" of the phony assault. Smollett's camp released an indignant statement insisting that he's still a victim, stating that he had no idea his attackers were known to him. Shortly thereafter, Smollett parted ways with his lawyer and obtained a new legal team.

When this allegation first burst into national headlines, my initial reaction was concerned skepticism. The idea of a young, black, gay man being targeted on account of his identity was, obviously, extremely disturbing. But there were pieces of the story that seemed far-fetched, right out of the gate. The ostensible ""MAGA country"" taunting felt a little too on the nose. And how would these supposed roving, violent racists have recognized someone who was bundled up in the frigid cold, in the wee hours of the morning? As more details emerged (he was still wearing the rope when police arrived, quite some time later? And he strolled into his building still carrying his sandwich after the alleged assault?) the likelihood that Smollett was telling the unvarnished truth decreased significantly. And now, thanks to some strong police work, it is now crystal clear that his story was utter garbage all along. The new revelations make certain statements he made just last week on ABC's Good Morning America look positively sociopathic:

Robin Roberts: “Why do you think you were targeted?”



Smollett: “I come really really hard against 45. I come really really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.” pic.twitter.com/jdfcroO1lL — Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) February 17, 2019



While certain outcomes of this ugly episode still remain to be seen (will Smollett confess, or possibly be charged?), social media has descended into a full-blown conflagration of recriminations. Many of those who hungrily lapped up Smollett's original tale are either ignoring the fresh updates entirely, slinking away with stealth deletions (e.g., the Speaker of the House), shifting blame, very belatedly urging caution, engaging in self-serving revisionism, or even expressing outright disappointment that this hate crime didn't happen:

Opinion: I doubted Jussie Smollett. It breaks my heart that I might be right. https://t.co/Y35G8pNXbm — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 17, 2019



One of the reasons accusations like this gain such currency in certain circles is because far too many people want to believe the worst about many of their fellow citizens. If you're convinced that Trump's America is a dangerous place for 'marginalized' populations, the Smollett claim confirmed your priors to a tee. As such, the response from people who were, by extension, deliberately smeared by this fiction is not tantamount to ""seizing"" or ""pouncing."" It's a form of self-preservation. Trump supporters are fully justified in pointing out that this disgusting slander has fallen apart at the seams, while also shaming those who uncritically grabbed hold of the story in order to bludgeon their political opponents. That was the relevant 'seizing' and 'pouncing' during this whole imbroglio. Two things can be true at once: First, racism is still a terrible and disgraceful -- albeit hopefully diminished -- problem in our society. These bigotries sometimes manifest in violence. Hate-motivated crimes really do happen. It's appalling and inexcusable. Second, in a twisted culture that prizes victimhood, 'hate' hoaxes (or crimes falsely attributed to certain groups) are more prevalent than one would ever hope. This thread documented a few dozen of the Trump-era examples:

Right after Donald Trump’s election, the SPLC really stoked panic. A pro-gay Episcopal church in Indiana was vandalized w/“Heil Trump,” a swastika, & an anti-gay slur. Turns out it was the gay organ player who did it. He was only charged w/a misdemeanor. https://t.co/QxeOoBHohC — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 17, 2019

In Sep. 2018 a black woman in Long Island said Trump supporters confronted her & told her “she didn’t belong here.” Her car tire was slashed the next day & a hateful note was left behind saying “go home.”



Adwoa Lewis made up the whole story. https://t.co/njVBvdjpoM pic.twitter.com/XEJh6NYxut — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 17, 2019



The list is depressingly long -- from lazy fabrications to ludicrously complex lies. In our polarized times, false claims of ""hate"" incidents are especially insidious and harmful. They waste valuable police resources. They undermine true victims. They spread mistrust. They sow racially-charged resentments. Those who perpetrate such hoaxes must be shamed by society and sanctioned by law. It's a sickness that contributes to our collective sickness, and it must be dealt with forcefully. And those journalists and activists who fuel the problem, some even going so far as to try to punish responsible practices, must face some of the resulting wrath, as well. I'll leave you with this:

J. Smollett case had plenty of red flags, but media was too attached to storyline (& victimhood) to see/admit them. Once again, journos dedicated more to proving *themselves* virtuous than to reporting facts botch the story. It’s tiresome & won’t change. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) February 17, 2019



UPDATE - Here are a few more interesting details about where this case might be heading. On Benson & Harf last night, Fox News correspondent Matt Finn reported that his Chicago Police sources say that in a matter of days, CPD may seek to compel the follow-up interview that Smollett seems deperate to avoid as his manipulative falsehoods come undone."

There is no doubt Jussie Smollett set out to create racial tensions and grind the political axe of his associates, anti-white, pro-gay blah blah in an attack aimed directly at the President of the United States. He and his co-conspirators that most likely include very senior Democrats are to blame and solely to blame, not White people, not the President, not Black people and not Gays, just the twisted minds of a few.

Politics has left the rails in the USA.

Socialism has made a massive resurgence in the USA with Leaders like Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders preaching the virtues of the most evil and destructive force the world has ever known, Socialism.

You can’t blame the Mexicans, Blacks, Muslims, Whites, Rich or any other minority for whatever perceived woes you believe exists in the Country, from the outside the USA looks to be doing pretty well.

Nor can you use it as an excuse to to dismiss real injustices in America, everyone must continue working toward a non-discriminatory society.

You can not brand a Politician a racist for enforcing immigration laws by building a wall or deporting illegal aliens. If the Democratic Party wants a change to the immigration law to allow free movement from Mexico to the USA they should have that as part of their platform, not support a porous border and the highly dangerous process of if you sneak in you can stay, if you get killed along the way bad luck.

A lot of what is coming out of the Democratic Party is Nonsense, ideas that appeal to the masses but have no basis in fact, a lot of what is coming from the Republican Party is being used as justification for discrimination, people need to spend more time looking at the real issues and understanding what is being said, not listening to sound bytes and looking at Memes on Social Media.

Social Media is a platform that allows those in control of it to dictate your perception on the world, and it is a false perception, if you were to publish every crime committed only by Black men, there would be a surge in racist rhetoric, if the same was done and only the crimes of White men were published there would be a backlash against them. Social Media and Mainstream Media are experts at this manipulation.

In reality i think there are very few White men scared to walk the street in case they are attacked by White men, I do not think there are many White men scared to walk the street in fear of Black men.

The narrative from the media is a falsehood, do not accept it, continue to work towards a fair, racially inclusive society.

A society created by Americans for Americans, that is not a Society of Socialism, Sharia Law but a Society built upon the constitution.

Deadline has confirmed with well placed sources that Smollett’s scenes in episodes of the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong co-created series are being slashed for production on Empire this week.

While the show is back at work today in the Windy City after the long weekend, Smollett will be a rare presence on the set of the Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard led show.

The actor has also been absent as Chicago PD request another interview with him. As Smollett himself has become the subject of deeper inquiry into the supposed assault that occurred in the early hours of January 29, detectives want to know more about the actor’s version of what happened that day on the streets of Chicago and any possible knowledge he may have to indicate the incident could have been preplanned.

The widely condemned attack was previously described as a racist and homophobic barrage that left Smollett beaten, drenched in bleach and with a rope slung around his neck. Openly gay, Smollett portrays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on Empire.

Now the reality appears to be more complex or at least convoluted.

There are no plans right now to make any changes to the remaining episodes of the fifth season of Empire that are already in the can, I hear.

Yet, despite the strongly expressed renewed support by Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney on February 17, upcoming episodes have seen serious rewrites in recent days to reduce the increasingly besieged Smollett’s role both in dramatic stints and musical performances.

Empire returns for the remainder of its fifth season on March 13.

Fox had no comment on Smollett’s scenes being cut, nor would the network confirm any such reports, as first noted by TMZ earlier Tuesday. Reps for the lawyered-up Smollett did not return request for comment by Deadline.

While Smollett is not considered a formal suspect at present, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities are seeking to be enlightened by him about his private relationship with Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo.

The brothers were previously described by Chicago police as “potential suspects” in the attack and arrested last week. Identified as the individuals in the photos of “persons of interest” in the Smollett case, the two were held without charge for 48 hours and then let go on the night of February 15.

Formerly Empire extras, the Osundario siblings, at least one of whom had been Smollett’s personal trainer, are now “fully” cooperating with authorities. They have sat for a number of interviews with police in recent days."

While reports continue to suggest that Empire star Jussie Smollett could have possibly orchestrated the racial and homophobic attack against him, Trevor Noah is starting an Emmy campaign for the actor.

During Monday’s episode of The Daily Show, the host weighed in on the “weird” story that has been unfolding over the past few weeks. After Smollett reported on Jan. 29 that he was the victim of a violent attack, new evidence has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” according to Chicago police, with a number of outlets reporting that investigators now believe that Smollett paid a pair of brothers to stage the incident. Through his lawyers, the 36-year-old has denied such allegations.

“There’s a certain part of this story that was always a little weird,” admitted Noah. “Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch Empire? Like, I’ve heard of hate watching, but that s— would be next level.”

Noah went on to play a clip of Smollett’s tear-filled interview on Good Morning America, in which he emphatically dismissed the idea that he could have embellished or made this story up. The comedian deemed the performance awards-worthy. “Either this guy’s telling the truth or he deserves an Emmy for that interview,” said Noah. “Because if all of that is just a performance, I don’t care what he’s lying about, you can’t cancel him. He’s too good to not be on TV!”

See the original story below.

Reports surface that Jussie Smollett's screen time on Empire will be taking a hit after news that he allegedly staged his attack in Chicago.

On Tuesday, Feb. 19, sources tell TMZ that the show has decided not to feature any scenes where Smollett is the focus. As a result, the actors nine scenes have been cut down to just four, x'ing out five scenes where Smollett was the sole star on the screen. In addition, it is said that Smollett's musical number that is planned for the end of the season is also in jeopardy of hitting the cutting room floor.

This had led to a major hit in Smollett's storyline. It is said that instead of being on set every day, he is only working Friday and possibly Thursday without rehearsing with the cast.

This follows reports that Chicago Police believe Smollett orchestrated his attack by recruiting two Empire crew members to stage a racist, homophobic assault. It has been reported that these accomplices will testify in the upcoming grand jury hearing to decide if Smollett should be subjected to a felony for filing a false police report.

However, Jussie Smollett's lawyers maintain their client's innocence and state he is ""angered"" by the allegations.

""Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" Smollett's attorneys stated. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."""

Cardi B is one of the latest celebrities to voice her opinion about the ongoing investigation involving Jussie Smollett.

In an Instagram Live video, Cardi said she is “really disappointed” in the “Empire” star and feels he “f–ked up Black History Month.”

Sources told CBS 2 News that Smollett allegedly promised to pay two friends, brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, $4,000 to stage a racist and homophobic assault — which the trio allegedly rehearsed beforehand.

Smollet said in an appearance on “Good Morning America” that he was “pissed off” that people doubted his story.

On Instagram, Cardi told her followers that she holding out some hope that the actor is telling the truth.

“Until he says out of his mouth that it was fake and this s–t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him because, you know … police in Chicago are racist, so they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar,” she said.

The rapper then shared a personal story, in which police allegedly put her in a headlock after they responded to a call about an altercation.

Director Ava DuVernay also expressed similar concerns in a tweet Sunday, pointing out how the Chicago police allegedly “covered up shooting Laquan McDonald.”

In a separate tweet, she added, “I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s case is expected to go before a grand jury."

However, the latest reports claiming that the entertainer staged the fight has many people sharing their opinion on Smollett, with Grammy Award-winning rapper Cardi B becoming the latest.

On Monday, Feb. 18, Bardi took to Instagram Live where she expressed her disappointment in Smollett.

""I'm really disappointed in him,"" Cardi began. ""I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro. Damn.""

Cardi's comments follow the news that the two men suspected to be Smollett's attackers were brothers that the actor knew personally. The men Ola and Abel Osundairo did not fit the description Smollett gave police. However, authorities believed that the two were involved in the attack and when their house was raided the police founds several items said to be used in the incident, including several bottles of bleach. In addition, Ola and Abel Osundairo were released from custody due to ""new evidence"" found in their interrogation as well as being suspected to testify about their involvement in the attack.

This information, along with the minority community's troubled history with the police, have many torn on whether to believe the cops or Smollett. As a result, Cardi does not completely dismiss the seriousness of Smollett's claims.

""Until he says out his mouth that this was fake and this shit staged then I don't want to completely blame him.

According to KABC-TV, an L.A. based black civil rights activist and director of Project Islamic HOPE, Najee Ali, is calling for Smollett’s arrest over the false story of his attack at the hands of a couple Trump supporters due to several factors, one being that he could have unintentionally started a race war.

Ali began by saying that the false claim was a “slap in the face” to actual members of the black and LGBT communities who have been victims.

“It’s a slap in the face. We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim…and we believe is a lie…certainly is an injustice to those true victims…,” Ali said. “Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying.”

“Also, Smollett could have created a race war,” Ali later added. “There are many African Americans and members of the LGBT community who are very upset and outraged by Smollett claiming he was attacked and victimized. So there was some in those communities who are more extreme.”

“They wanted to retaliate,” said Ali.

Ali stressed that there should be calm and peace.

Smollett was dangerously close to creating a media-driven fury campaign against Trump supporters after he proved willing to press charges on two innocent people, only pulling back when he discovered the two people police were asking him to charge were the two Nigerian brothers he hired to attack him.

This very well may have kickstarted something horrific such as riots or retaliatory attacks fueled in part by the media’s need to sensationalize stories like this one.

As of now, the only people suffering bigoted attacks are those on the right who wear MAGA hats."

In an uncomfirmed report last week, a Chicago ABC affiliate said sources close to the investigation believed that actor Jussie Smollett allegedly staged the attack on himself because he was getting written off of “Empire.” In a new, likewise unconfirmed report, TMZ says unnamed production sources told them Smollett’s role in the show is already getting “slashed,” even before any potential formal charges are brought against the embattled star.

“Jussie Smollett’s ‘Empire’ screen time is getting slashed in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the so-called ‘attack,'” TMZ reports. Citing “production sources,” TMZ reports that the actor “was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d.”

Even in the four remaining scenes, TMZ reports, he’s supposedly “no longer the focus”; instead, he is set to appear in ensemble moments, where “he’s flanked by a number of cast members.” According to the outlet, Smollett is thus spending less time on set this week, working just Friday and possibly Thursday, with no rehearsal time scheduled.

Meanwhile, the writers are busy heavily reworking the script, TMZ’s sources say, having already produced “multiple revisions.”

TMZ is also reporting that its law enforcement sources say a Grand Jury will likely be convened as early as Tuesday with police currently gathering their evidence for a felony indictment for filing a false police report. The Chicago Police Department has not publicly confirmed or denied that claim either.

Last Thursday evening, Chicago’s ABC7 Eyewitness News reported that “multiple sources” told them that “police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire.'”

Smollett’s representatives and Twentieth Century Fox Television both quickly denied the claim about him being axed from the show. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous,” Fox said in a statement responding to ABC’s report. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Smollett’s “hate crime” case took a dramatic turn on Saturday when police revealed that two brothers of Nigerian descent — associates of the actor who were initially viewed as “potential suspects” — were not charged and were now “fully cooperating” with authorities. The two men reportedly told police that Smollett paid them a total of $4,000 to fake the January 29 “attack.” Smollett told both the police and the public that he was attacked by two Trump supporters who screamed “n***er,” “f***ot,” and “This is MAGA country,” beat him, poured bleach on him, and put a “noose” around his neck.

Since the bombshell reports Saturday, Smollett has refused to meet with Chicago PD for further questioning. On Monday, multiple outlets reported a potential motive for the attack, citing sources close to the investigation who said they learned that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter allegedly sent to him did not get a “bigger reaction” from the media. That claim has also yet to be either confirmed or denied by police.

In the backseat of our friend's Honda Civic, Ashley was rubbing her chest, taking tiny sips of air through chapped lips. We were 16, and had been friends for nearly a decade, but I had never seen her like this. I asked Ashley what was wrong; she said, ""I have really bad anxiety.""

She told me her mom was helping her get medication, because she felt like this all the time, and once it started, she couldn't stop it. My heart dropped. I knew this feeling: nothing was wrong. We weren't in trouble. We were driving through our beautiful, wooded, sunny hometown, bopping to Top 40 music—an extremely low stakes situation. But it didn't matter. And it hadn't when I had felt it, either. Anxiety isn't situational and it doesn't discriminate—it comes and goes as it pleases, rips through your core like a tropical storm, and leaves you swirling, gasping, begging for relief. That was the first time I heard the word ""anxiety"" used to describe a disorder, rather than a feeling.

I'm not sure I ever saw mental disorders portrayed in media when I was young. Having ""mental problems"" was a roast meant to be lobbed at your craziest friend, a silly punch line from What About Bob? I thought people with mental health issues were mythological lunatics—I couldn't possibly know one myself; I couldn't possibly be one myself. These people were medicated, locked in institutions, bound by straitjackets, strapped to their beds, forced to question their own realities, and diagnosed as clinically insane. Obviously, people with mental health issues can experience these things. But the problem is, unlike what pop culture would have had me believe, they might experience none of these things. But it's because mental disorders are so stigmatized that I was clueless about how these issues could affect anyone—me.

I've been living with severe anxiety for years, and although I would argue it didn't truly ""activate"" until my early 20s, I definitely felt ripples of it in my adolescence. It's been a decade since that memorable moment in the Honda Civic, and in that time, I've seen major strides made in onscreen representation for marginalized communities—though, I'm not sure I'd call anxious people ""marginalized"" so much as ""misrepresented"" or ""misunderstood."" But even with those advances, I've barely ever seen my perpetual, tortured mental state played out onscreen.

I know I'm not alone with my anxiety—I have many friends and family members who suffer from the same issues. But on TV, in music, and on the big screen, anxiety disorders can feel invisible, which brings about a sort of cognitive dissonance; I never see a stranger walk by on the street and think, Maybe she's like me. In fact, quite the opposite. I think, What's it like to be normal? To stroll down the street without spinning on an inner hamster wheel? To just live? Even though anxiety is very Zeitgeist-y right now—if I see one more meme about being anxious, I'll lose it—it hasn't been normalized. And that makes me feel alone.

When we see mental health issues depicted in pop culture, we often see depression, like You're the Worst or the Sarah Silverman-starring I Smile Back; tragic suicide, like 13 Reasons Why or Christine; dissociative personality disorders, like Split; sociopathy or psychopathy, like American Psycho or Dexter; or obsessive and violent episodes, like You and the upcoming Greta.

But where are the movies and TV shows about anxiety? Like, real-life anxiety, the inescapable kind that follows you around like a sinister shadow, threatening to upheave your life if you're presented with even the most trivial of triggers. Movies or shows centered around mental illness are usually designed to lead to a big climax, a collapse, a tragedy, an event—like when Cate Blanchett's titular character utterly unravels in Blue Jasmine, or when Hannah kills herself in 13 Reasons. Or maybe the boiling point serves as a launching pad for the story, like in Silver Linings Playbook, when Pat moves in with his parents after a stint in a mental institution. We often follow these characters' descent into madness or the aftermath of major breakdowns. The reality of living with anxiety—what it's like to manage and endure it—just isn't as cinematic because of how rare it is to have that ""big bang.""

For many—and definitely for me—anxiety is about minutiae. It's an overwhelming deluge of little things, and trying not to let them swallow me. The goal is to somehow make sense of this thundercloud looming in my chest, daring me to acknowledge it, to succumb to it, to panic in an important business meeting, or on a plane I can't get off, or at dinner with a friend who won't stop talking. It's about sitting with it, living with being uncomfortable, trying new ways to allay that feeling—whether it be through medication, meditation, yoga, exercise, special diets, crystals, whatever. The reality of living with an anxiety disorder is that every day is different, and there's no apex or devastating final act. It's monotony. I wake up, I desperately try to get through it, I learn and I re-learn how to deal, because some days, the things that usually helped to soothe me or alleviate the pain just don't work anymore.

Yes, anxiety has been represented onscreen. But, Blue Jasmine is the only movie I've ever felt truly recognized me (which is dark). And yet watching it was like watching my worst fears come to life. It was like a horror movie and makes me wonder what would happen if I let my broken brain go to the precipice it so often begs me to step toward. And that's more terrifying than any blockbuster horror franchise. Fuck off, Saw.

But things are changing. More creators and musicians are starting to illustrate mental health in more realistic ways. Twenty-one Pilots have incredible songs about living with anxiety and depression—I recently cried listening to ""Migraine,"" in which Tyler Joseph sings, ""Am I the only one I know waging wars behind my face and above my throat?"" Natasha Lyonne's new show Russian Doll offers brilliant thematic metaphors for grappling with your own depression, trauma, and PTSD. Ariana Grande's new album thank u, next is brimming with mental health bops about obsessing and overthinking and trying desperately to reel in an imaginative brain.

In January, Julia Michaels released a song with Selena Gomez called ""Anxiety."" Michaels has opened up about her struggles with the disorder, and I relate to most of the lyrics, like, ""My exes will say I'm hard to deal with, and I admit it, it's true."" Me. Or, ""I got all these thoughts, running through my mind, all the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off."" But other parts feel minimizing—and I don't think it's any fault of the song itself, but rather a knee-jerk reaction to seeing my own mental disorder being memed to death, like it's a cute, quirky character trait.

Anxiety isn't just about overthinking, or wanting to bail on plans with friends (I mean, trust me, it's definitely about these things). There's more to it. It's the consequence of overthinking, the places it pushes you after hours of stewing over something completely inconsequential, and feeling the physical effects of such on your body—a throbbing heart, a clenched chest, a constricted airway or rising vomit. It's the wheels that are constantly turning, and trying to control them, or, at very least, guide them without letting them cripple you. Discussion of mental health shouldn't always about the breakdown to end all breakdowns; it should also be about the little moments, like being paralyzed by a bottomless social media scroll, or abruptly leaving a date to throw up, or those times when I find myself wobbling back-and-forth on the balls of my feet, trying to decide if I should go to the kitchen or the bathroom first, or if they're the same distance, or which would make more sense logistically. It's an indefatigable battle.

I want to see a change in pop culture. Maybe I want to change it myself. If you've ever been admitted to a mental institution, or if you've attempted suicide, or you're bipolar, or you're gravely depressed—you're not alone, you're not hopeless, and you're not ""crazy."" I want to strip these mental disorders of harmful stigma, and I want to stop seeing them glorified onscreen. I want to talk about anxiety and depression in ways that are honest and real and empathetic, and dig my fingers into their day-to-day realities. So, that's what I'm going to do. The movie about my life isn't supposed to end, not yet. Actually, I don't even want it to be a movie—I want my life to be an award-winning series that gets super-uninteresting in its eighth season because all the characters end happy and resolved. Does that sound boring? To me, it sounds like the most fascinating thing in the world. Now all I need to do is figure out how to tell that story."

5am – A/B/C JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S STORY COLLAPSES: What Does This Say About America Today?

“We are not racist…we are not anti-Trump” Jussie Smollett’s alleged attackers release statement and announce they’re continuing to cooperate with police, meanwhile Smollett denies police requests for a second interview.

Brothers implicated in attack on Jussie Smollett tell police the ‘Empire’ actor was upset that earlier threatening letter didn’t get enough attention, sources tell ABC News.

Al Sharpton says Jussie Smollett should ‘face accountability to the maximum’ if attack was orchestrated

Jussie Smollett Gets Renewed Support From ‘Empire’ Showrunner Over Attack

TMZ: Jussie Smollett ‘Empire’ Role Slashed … In Wake of ‘Attack’ Scandal. Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d. As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.

AWKWARD: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) on her tweet saying the Jussie Smollett case was an “attempted modern-day lynching”: “Which tweet? What tweet? … [laughs] Um, ah, ah, uh, okay, so I will say this about that case, I think the facts are still unfolding and um, I’m very, um, concerned”

5am – D Maryland, Virginia are among the 16 states challenging Trump’s national emergency declaration. 16 states file lawsuit to stop Trump’s national emergency declaration. (CNN) — Sixteen states on Monday evening filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration. The group of states, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. “We’re going to try to halt the President from violating the Constitution, the separation of powers, from stealing money from Americans and states that has been allocated by Congress, lawfully,” Becerra told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. The attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Virginia joined California in the lawsuit. It’s the latest challenge to hit the Trump administration, which already faces a litany of lawsuits over the national emergency declaration. Over the weekend, the Center for Biological Diversity, Border Network for Human Rights, which marched with Beto O’Rourke in El Paso, Texas, last week, and the American Civil Liberties Union all announced lawsuits. At the core of each lawsuit is the argument that Trump is circumventing Congress to fund the wall along the US-Mexico border by declaring an emergency. “The Constitution assigns Congress the power of the purse, and no prior president has ever tried to use emergency powers to fund a chosen project — particularly a permanent, large-scale domestic project such as this — against congressional will. This is obviously improper,” said Dror Ladin, staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project.

6am – A Ex-Russia probe overseer Rod Rosenstein ‘to step down by March.’ Rod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general who oversaw the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling, is to step down by mid-March, US media say. Reports emerged last month that Mr Rosenstein planned to quit once incoming Attorney General William Barr took over. Mr Barr’s appointment was confirmed by the Senate last week. Mr Rosenstein has frequently been the target of President Donald Trump’s criticism. A justice department official quoted by Reuters said Mr Rosenstein’s decision was not linked to renewed claims that he had once suggested secretly recording Mr Trump. In a TV interview on Sunday, former-acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said talks had been held in 2017 about invoking the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution that could remove a president deemed unfit. He said Mr Rosenstein had held discussions on the number of cabinet members and others needed to invoke the clause.

6am – B Trump tells Venezuela military to back Guaido or ‘lose everything.’ Miami (AFP) – US President Donald Trump on Monday urged Venezuela’s military to accept opposition leader Juan Guaido’s amnesty offer, or stand to “lose everything,” as a crisis deepened over President Nicolas Maduro’s refusal to let in desperately needed humanitarian aid. Bringing in humanitarian aid is crucial to the viability of Guaido, who has denounced Maduro’s re-election last year as fraudulent and in January declared himself interim president, a move recognized by some 50 countries. He has given the Maduro government until Saturday to let shipments of mainly US aid into the country, which is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis due to shortages of food and medicine exacerbated by hyperinflation. Addressing supporters and Venezuelan expatriates in Miami, Trump said he had a message for officials helping keep Maduro in place. “The eyes of the entire world are upon you today, every day and every day in the future. “You cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you. You can choose to accept president Guaido’s generous offer of amnesty to live your life in peace with your families and your countrymen.

6am – C Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the move again … and it’s a big deal. (TMZ) — We got RBG Monday in D.C. at Reagan National Airport and she answered the question on the minds of millions of worried Americans — how’s she doin’? Justice Ginsburg walked slowly but steadily and with purpose as she arrived from a flight. She’s flanked on all sides by security who kept a watchful eye on the woman who tilts the balance of power on the Supreme Court. As you know, RBG missed 2 weeks of oral argument at the High Court after going under the knife for lung cancer. She’s doing markedly better than January 9, when she was seen getting in her car after surgery, and since that time she’s been given a clean bill of health. She’s 85, and has said as long as she can approach her job with full steam, she’s not going anywhere.

6am – D TUESDAY SPECIAL ELECTION:

A special election on Tuesday to fill a vacant seat in the Virginia House of Delegates could be the first sign of how much the scandals in Richmond have hurt Democrats. (Washington Post) – In an increasingly blue district where Gov. Ralph S. Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark R. Herring carried nearly 70 percent of the vote in 2017, Democrat Ibraheem Samirah, a 27-year-old dentist, entered the election as a heavy favorite. But that was before Northam, Herring and Fairfax — all Democrats — became embroiled in allegations of racial or sexual misconduct, and before the same right-leaning website that broke the news of those scandals aired old social media posts by Samirah that are critical of Israel. Now, Republican Gregg Nelson, 63 , is calling attention to Samirah’s online comments, and trying to link him to the political chaos in Richmond, writing on his own Facebook page: “Racism has no place in our Commonwealth. Especially from individuals in office or seeking office.”

(Fox News) — A Democratic candidate who has apologized after once saying that giving money to Israel was worse than donating to the Ku Klux Klan is looking to win a seat in the Virginia state legislature on Tuesday. Ibraheem Samirah, a dentist and Chicago native who bills himself as a “second-generation Palestinian refugee,” recently made headlines when he denounced what he called a “slander campaign” that exposed a series of old social media posts that were viewed as anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. “This slander campaign is using five-year-old Facebook posts from my impassioned college days, posts that upon my reflection and with the blessing of time, I sincerely regret and apologize for,” Samirah said in a statement on Friday. “I am so sorry that my ill-chosen words added to the pain of the Jewish community, and I seek your understanding and compassion as I prove to you our common humanity. Please do not let those who seek to divide us use these words out of context of time and place to accomplish their hateful goals.” In addition to the remark about the Klan, Samirah has also said the late Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would burn in hell. In another post, he charged Israeli teenagers were using Tinder to “cover up the murders in their names.” Samirah is running in a special election for a vacated seat in Virginia’s 86th district, a suburban area in Fairfax County. The conservative website Big League Politics first reported the story, which has been picked up by Israeli media. Samirah’s apology hasn’t been accepted by critics who say he remains virulently anti-Israel. They note in particular that he has advocated on social media for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. BDS supports Palestinian rights and opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. Israeli officials say the BDS movement is anti-Semitic.Samirah’s opponent in the race is Gregg Nelson, an Air Force Veteran whose campaign took up the issue after the story of the past posts broke.

His official announcement video is expected to stream online Tuesday morning. “I wanted to let the people of the state of Vermont know about this first,” Sanders told VPR’s Bob Kinzel. “And what I promise to do is, as I go around the country, is to take the values that all of us in Vermont are proud of — a belief in justice, in community, in grassroots politics, in town meetings — that’s what I’m going to carry all over this country.” Sanders said he is running to oppose President Donald Trump, and to enact many of the progressive ideas — including universal health care coverage, a $15 minimum wage and reducing student debt — that he championed in 2016. “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country,” Sanders said. “I think he is a pathological liar… I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.” Sanders said his campaign hopes to enlist one million people in a “grassroots movement of people prepared to stand up and fight.”

If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything.” Guaido has set a target of signing up to a million volunteers to help bring in the aid, with 600,000 already registered.

7am – C Second Justin Fairfax accuser calls for public hearing into assault allegations. (Fox News) — A woman who has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of raping her while they were undergraduates at Duke University nearly two decades ago called Monday for the state’s general assembly to hold a public hearing into her allegations and those of another woman against the Democrat. Meredith Watson wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece that she was “frustrated by calls for an investigation rather than a public hearing” into the allegations brought against Fairfax by her and Vanessa Tyson. “Such ‘investigations’ are secret proceedings, out of the public eye, leaving victims vulnerable to selective leaks and smears. And we all know how such investigations end: with ‘inconclusive results,'” Watson wrote. “My privacy has already been violated, yet I am still willing to testify publicly under oath. Tyson has made the same offer. Our plea to the Virginia General Assembly to require the same of Fairfax has been met with inaction.” Watson has said that Fairfax raped her in 2000, but that she did not report it because of how Duke officials responded to her earlier claim that she was raped by basketball star Corey Maggette. An attorney for Watson has claimed that Fairfax was one of the people she told about the alleged assault by Maggette and that the future lieutenant governor “used this prior assault against Ms. Watson” when he allegedly raped her. The attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, claimed that Fairfax told Watson at a campus party after the alleged assault that “I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you’d be too afraid to say anything.” Last week, Fox News obtained Facebook messages from Watson in which she commented on Fairfax’s 2017 candidacy for Virginia lieutenant governor and told contacts about the alleged rape.

7am – D/E JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S STORY COLLAPSES



8am – A INTERVIEW – STEVE EMERSON — executive director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a non-profit group that investigates the threat of radical Islam

8am – B/C INTERVIEW — JOE CONCHA – media reporter, The Hill – discussed the media coverage of the Jussie Smollet scandal and the fawning coverage of Kamala Harris.

BRIT HUME: This is just embarrassing. So now journalists are going shopping with Harris, helping pick out clothes and then putting out glowing tweets about it.

MAEVE RESTON DOUBLES DOWN ON SUCKING UP TO HARRIS: Dear America – I will never apologize for encouraging a presidential candidate to try on a vintage rainbow sequin jacket #2020

AWKWARD: Kamala Harris on her Jussie Smollett ‘modern day lynching’ tweet… a.k.a. What it looks like when you’ve been out shopping with your new BFF reporter girlfriends then a real journalist asks you a real question…

On Monday, CNN’s Brian Stelter said, “There was a rush to judgment” in the case of Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime, but it did not come from media outlets. “I think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people. I think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations. But it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day,” he said."

Unfortunately, the media choosing hoaxes over inconvenient hate crimes is something we have seen before.

The American media is not only garbage, it is a broken institution, forever broken; and yes, the media are the enemy of the people.

A media interested in operating in any kind of good faith, with any sense of professional or civic responsibility, would have forever learned the lesson of the 2015 “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” debacle. For weeks the media, most especially the far-left CNN, poured gasoline all over that hoax only to see it end in the worst way imaginable: with violence. And not just violence, but rioting. And not just rioting, but the destruction of a predominantly black, working class neighborhood.

But here we are, four years later, and the media have not only refused to learn from the tragic mistake that they are running amok, spreading hoax after hoax after hoax, and deliberately using these hoaxes to spread hate and division.

In less than four months, the media have gleefully, recklessly, and relentlessly advanced the following lies: Brett Kavanaugh Serial-Rapist, Those Racist Covington Catholic Boys, Trump the Russian Spy Ordered His Lawyer to Lie, and Jussie Smollett.

What do all of these hoaxes, including “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” share in common? That’s an easy one — narrative upside for Democrats: America Is Racist. White Catholic Trump Supporters Are Racist. Young Republican Frat Boys Are Serial Rapists, Trump the Russian Spy Committed a Felony, MAGA Hats Are the New White Hoods.

It is all about politics. It is all about advancing the cause of Democrats, no matter the cost to our country or even working people in a place called Ferguson.

How do we know this for sure?

Well, let’s look at two legitimate hate crimes the media refuse to cover, even though both are caught on video. One from two years ago you may have heard of. The other you probably knew nothing about.

A mere two years ago, there was a racially-motivated hate crime in Chicago, the same city where Smollett staged his own fantasy. While screaming “fuck white people” and “fuck Trump,” four black people kidnapped and tortured a developmentally disabled white man.

For two whole days, this man was terrorized, bound with tape, and after a beating opened a wound, bleach was poured on the cuts. The four monsters were so proud of themselves they not only laughed through it all, they streamed it live on Facebook.

Horrific hate crime.

Video.

Politically charged.

Everything the media claim to be motivated by was right there for the taking, and still the story was buried, not covered at all, or rationalized as “not evil” by a CNN that quickly moved on.

Did you know that on the very same night, January 29, Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime against himself there was an actual hate crime caught on video in Brooklyn, New York?

Until the Daily Wire reported it on Monday, I knew nothing about it.

Watch for yourself:

A Jew brutally beaten last night in Brooklyn. Nothing stolen. Antisemitism is alive and well in NYC. Time for a hard look at who is doing it and its cause. This has been going on in NY long before Charlottesville or 2016 just ask anyone visibly Jewish. pic.twitter.com/z86dz32YBL — Motti Seligson (@mottiseligson) January 30, 2019

In fact, there have been a slew of reported hate crimes against Jews in New York over the past few months you probably know nothing about. As reported by the Jerusalem Post:

Early in January, a Jewish man was attacked by a group of ‘teenage black males’ in the Crown Heights area of New York. The young man, 19, was “violently assaulted,” as Collive reported, the attack is currently under investigation by the New York Police Department in conjunction with the Hate Crimes Task Force. … In December, there was an attack on an identifiably Jewish teen in Queens, New York which was later classified as a gang incident and not a hate crime, angering a local Jewish community. The Jewish boy, David Paltielov, 16, remained hospitalized one week after the Nov. 29 attack in the Forest Hills neighborhood, the Gothamist reported. He was wearing a kippa and tzitzit at the time of the attack. Two other Orthodox Jewish teens were attacked in separate incidents in Brooklyn on the same day. In a related development, in October of last year, an Orthodox Jewish man was beaten at a traffic intersection in Brooklyn in an assault that was determined to be a hate crime by the New York City Police Department.

A serious, brewing problem in a major American city; legitimate, racially-motivated hate crimes that have gotten zero attention from the national media…

But those are inconvenient hate crimes, inconvenient to the media’s narrative that only Trump supporters are racist and violent; inconvenient to a media that is so broken, so evil, such a true enemy of the people, that rather than report the truth, they would prefer to fabricate and advance hoaxes.

According to a report from the website LOGO, Dave Chappelle riffed on Jussie Smollett orchestrating a hate crime, saying “that it made him so mad he wanted to break a dollhouse over the star’s head.”

The “dollhouse” joke is a reference to a years-old joke from comedian Kevin Hart.

“Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay,'” Hart said in a social media post in 2011.

I wonder when Kevin Hart is gonna start deleting all his old tweets pic.twitter.com/ZbYG6SI3Xm — Benjamin Lee (@benfraserlee) December 5, 2018

Following the exposure of these years-old gay jokes in December, the comedian stepped down from his role in hosting the Oscars.

Chappelle also reportedly joked that “that he hoped ‘the gays’ take the brunt of the blow back” from Smollett’s hoax crime.

Jussie Smollett claimed in January to have been victimized in downtown Chicago by two Trump supporters who beat him, threw a chemical on him, put a rope around his neck, and called him homophobic and racial slurs while yelling “This is MAGA country!”

The attack generated national headlines, and was gleefully repeated by the establishment media figures as well as celebrities who used it to smear President Donald Trump and his supporters.

However, Chicago police now believe, according to numerous reports, that the actor paid two men to attack him, likely two Nigerian brothers that were also reportedly paid by Smollett."

TMZ reports:

Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d. As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members. With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we’re told Jussie’s working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

The report comes amid reports that Smollett “concocted” a “staged attacked” against himself after receiving a racist letter addressed to him failed to evoke a “bigger reaction.”

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2’s Brad Edwards, who reported “other sources corroborated that information.”

A letter with “white powder” was sent January 22 to a Chicago set where Empire was filming in the days leading up to the alleged staged attack. Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi confirmed to CNN that a HAZMAT team was called to Cinespace Studios, where the program was being shot, after the letter was discovered.

The substance was determined to be powdered aspirin, Guglielmi said. TMZ previously reported Smollett had received a letter at Fox studios that said “Die Black fag.”

The FBI is reportedly investigating the letter.

A press representative of Smollett’s crisis management firm said Monday that the actor had no plans to meet with Chicago police after detectives obtained “new evidence” while interrogating two Nigerian brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — said to have helped stage the attack.

On Saturday evening, CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported at least one of the brothers bought up the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. It was picked up at the direction of Smollett, said De Mar. The brothers reportedly were paid $3,500 and promised an additional $500.

Smollett, who is gay and African-American, told police that two masked individuals spewed racist and anti-gay slurs at him and poured an unknown chemical substance as he walked home from a sandwich shop at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The actor claimed his attackers looped a rope around his neck and screamed “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene.

In a statement to ABC News, attorneys for the Smollett said the actor was “angered” and “further victimized” by claims that staged his own attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the pair continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

On Sunday, Empire executive producer Brett Mahoney reiterated his support for Smollett.

Smollett, under Illinois State law, could receive up to three years in jail if he is found to have filed a false report with police."

But as the interview wrapped and Smollett's team departed, there was ""immediately"" a feeling that ""something was amiss.""

He allegedly requested that Robin Roberts conduct the conversation because he, to some extent, knows her personally: She appeared on an April 2018 episode of ""Empire.""

He was ""adamant"" about appearing on the show, The Post reports.

The interview aired Thursday, Feb. 14, just over two weeks after Smollett claimed two men attacked him with rope and bleach in Chicago while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. The men in question, two brothers who have also appeared on ""Empire,"" have since said that Smollett paid them to fake the attack.

Roberts on Monday defended the network's decision to air the interview, which was taped on Tuesday, Feb. 12.

“At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative,"" Roberts said. ""Now this was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.""

Now awaiting Smollett are not only potential legal consequences -- a grand jury begins hearing evidence Tuesday that could lead to felony indictment for allegedly filing a false police report -- but serious career ones, as well.

While he is working on set of ""Empire"" on Friday of this week, TMZ reports that ""Empire"" writers are quickly re-writing the season's final episodes. The second-to-last episode is currently being shot, and Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a ""big musical number,"" but five of his scenes and the entire musical number have been slashed."

Both ABC News and CBS Chicago report that sources tell them the Empire actor paid two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, to orchestrate the attack after a letter sent to the Empire set threatening the 36-year-old star didn’t receive a “bigger reaction.”

Very important to note: Police have not confirmed these reports.

Related: In first interview since attack, Jussie Smollett says he’s “pissed off” at those who doubt his story

According to the ABC and CBS reports, the brothers, both acquaintances of Smollett, were reportedly paid $3500 to stage the attack, which happened in the early hours of January 29.

One of the brothers had previously worked as an extra on the Empire set; the other was Smollett’s former personal trainer.

Speaking to CBS Chicago, the brothers say: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

CBS Chicago reports:

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29.

Meanwhile, TMZ reports that the trio had rehearsed the attack beforehand. The men purportedly scouted locations, finally choosing on near Smollett’s apartment.

According to TMZ:

The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action. Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to the point he’d be seriously injured. On the night Jussie says he was attacked, the brothers claim they showed up at the scene but were extremely nervous because, just as they played out the scene, a car drove by and they were worried they’d be ID’d.

Once again, it’s important to note that police have not confirmed these reports. Police have said, however, that they want to question Smollett again but, so far, he has refused to sit down with them.

On Sunday, his attorney issued a statement, saying:

We are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie Smollett’s lawyers are in contact with the Chicago Police Department. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner that does not include talking to media at this time.

According to TMZ, Smollett’s scenes in upcoming episodes of Empire have been cut.

—Sixth-grade student who refused to stand for Pledge of Allegiance arrested at Florida school—

Dhakira Talbot’s son, who attends Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland, refused a substitute teacher’s order to stand during the Pledge of Alliance, something the school has admitted he didn’t actually have to do.

“What happened that day, my son was doing what I asked him to do. I told my son that you stand up for yourself. Because in the way this world is today, if you don’t stand up for yourself, no one will,” Talbot told NBC Nightly News.

The student reportedly told the teacher that the flag was racist against Black people.

Police charged the unidentified 11-year-old student with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence after he was kicked out of class, Bay 9 News reports.

In a statement to the district, the substitute teacher reportedly told the student, “Why if it was so bad here he did not go to another place to live.” She said he then said, “they brought me here.”

She claims he replied by saying, “Well you can always go back, because I came here from Cuba and the day I feel I’m not welcome here anymore I would find another place to live.”

She wrote, “Then I had to call the office because I did not want to continue dealing with him.”

—Brothers at the center of Jussie Smollett hate crime investigation speak out—

“I just think that they didn’t handle it the way they should have handled it,” Talbot told NBC.

The Polk County School District issued a statement, saying:

“The student was arrested after becoming disruptive and refusing to follow repeated instructions by school staff and law enforcement. This incident followed the daily Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom.

“To be clear, the student was NOT arrested for refusing to participate in the pledge; students are not required to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance. Unfortunately, a substitute teacher was not aware of this, and she engaged in an exchange of words with the student and called the school’s administration to come to her classroom. The school’s resource officer, who is permanently assigned to the campus, also responded to the substitute’s classroom but was not called by the administration regarding the incident.”

—Outrage after newspaper calls for KKK to terrorize DC Democrats ‘Hang all of them’—

“She was wrong. She was way out of place,” Talbot said about the teacher. “If she felt like there was an issue with my son not standing for the flag, she should’ve resolved that in a way different manner than she did,” Talbot said.

The teacher reportedly no longer is allowed to teach in the district."

I happened to catch this excellent movie about the work of the Postal Inspectors, starring Louis Gossett, and hope it can be found on one of the digital streaming services, or maybe even run on one of the cable networks, when the federal case goes forward, if it does.

If the remarkable grassroots journalists at CWBChicago are correct (as they have been all along), Jussie Smollett has a lot more to worry about than the state rap of a class four felony of making a false police report. If he was indeed responsible for the sending of a letter to the Fox Chicago studios where Empire is produced, he has triggered federal charges that carry hard time. Importantly, the feds don't parole early to relieve overcrowded prisons the way the Great State of Illinois does.

A month ago, Jussie Smollett was a B- or C-level celebrity, with plenty of friends in high places. That is gone forever. He might conceivably have gotten away with probation on the state charges, with his record of no previous infractions and overcrowded prisons. With feds involved, that is much less likely.

Depending on which terrorism statutes are invoked, the prison time could be substantial. Then there is the matter of all the statements (to police and media) that Smollett made after the hoax attack was carried out. They could well trigger federal obstruction of justice charges on top of the terroristic threat charges.

Okay, this is not nailed down on the public record, but if I had to bet, I'd say this is very likely to be true.

Late Monday, CWBChicago received confirmation that the letter case has been before a federal grand jury and multiple subpoenas have been generated over the course of the investigation.

Since being created by Benjamin Franklin — yes, that Benjamin Franklin — the service has learned a few things about tracing mail-based crimes. Figuring out who mailed a letter has been made easier because, while most criminals know to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, most criminals also forget to leave their cellphones at home when they go to the mailbox.

""Those postal guys are the real deal,"" said a North Side cop who worked with inspectors on a serial package theft case in Lincoln Park last November . ""They can do amazing things and aren't afraid of the work.""

Whoever sent the letter to Smollett may have considered the mail to be an untraceable way to deliver a message. They'd be mistaken.

Headed by the FBI's Chicago Field Office, the terroristic threat investigation is being assisted by one of America's oldest and most underestimated law enforcement agencies: The United States Postal Inspection Service.

As Smollett reported the attack to police, a multi-agency federal investigation into the source of the threat letter was entering its seventh day.

About a week after Smollett opened the letter, he told police that he had been beaten and kicked in Streeterville by two men who recognized him from Empire. They poured bleach on him and — in throwbacks to the threat letter — called him anti-gay, anti-black slurs while putting a noose around his neck and screaming ""this is MAGA country,"" he said.

The letter, which was reported to the Chicago cops, triggered a federal investigation even before the hoax attack was carried out.

Four days later and about eleven miles away, the letter found its way to Smollett.

The envelope was addressed in childlike scrawl to Empire TV star Jussie Smollett at Cinespace Studios, a West Side production facility that the Fox program calls home. ""MAGA"" — the acronym for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" — was sloppily written in the return address space.

Using the U.S. Mail in furtherance of this hoax may have been the biggest blunder of all. Nobody wants the feds to Go Postal (Inspector) on him.

“He must be held accountable in the strictest way. He must repay resources used to investigate and serve time for the division he caused. The media should be the most outraged. He played all of them for fools. He knew they would cover it,” Haley tweeted Tuesday.

Members of the media, celebrities, and politicians initially reacted with anger and disgust to the alleged attack, but as the incident spun off into a nearly month-long saga with police yet to determine who orchestrated the alleged attack, some are now walking back their statements and are calling for all the facts to come out before making judgment.

Police opened a hate crime investigation Jan. 29 after Smollett, who is black and gay, alleged he was beaten by two men, who poured bleach on him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs, as well as “This is MAGA country.” One of the suspects also tied a rope around his neck, Smollett said.

Police thus far have been unable to find surveillance footage of the attack. The lack of evidence in the case fueled speculation that the attack had been fabricated. But a Chicago Police Department spokesman pushed back on that last week, saying there was no evidence to back up the claims that Smollett was lying.

It was reported over the weekend that brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, the first of whom worked with Smollett on “Empire,” said they had been paid by Smollett to attack him.

Chicago police questioned the bothers and said afterwards that new evidence had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" Police also said they wanted to interview Smollett again. A lawyer for Smollett said his client was “angered and devastated"" by reports that he knew his alleged attackers.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” police said in a statement Sunday.

Cardi B believes that Jussie Smollett has “f***ed up Black History Month” if he faked the alleged homophobic and racist attack against him.

The gay Empire actor was subjected to homophobic slurs and had a chemical substance poured on him during the January 29 incident, but outlets including CNN and CBS have reported that Chicago police think he orchestrated the attack himself.

In an Instagram Live stream recorded by pop culture site Pop Crave on Monday (February 18), Cardi B told her fans: “Jussie Smollett, whatever the f**k his name is, I’m really disappointed in him.

Cardi B gave her opinion on the Jussie Smollett case on Instagram live. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/6AYU7cT5nL — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) February 18, 2019

“I feel like he f***ed up Black History Month, bro,” added the Grammy Award-winning artist, who revealed last year that she’s had same-sex encounters with “a lot of women.”

“I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he says it out his mouth that it was fake and the s**t was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to, they said police in Chicago are racist,” continued the rapper.

“You gave Donald f**king Trump immunity to f**king laugh at n*****s and s**t.” — Cardi B

“So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you f***ed up, for real.

“Like, why would you do that? You ain’t have to do that. Then you gave Donald f***ing Trump immunity to f***ing laugh at n*****s and s**t, and make motherf***ers look bad.”

Cardi B hopes Jussie Smollett is telling the truth

Cardi B added that she wanted to give Smollett “the benefit of the doubt,” because of a previous incident in which she alleged that police put her in a headlock.

Smollett’s lawyers have denied that he had any role in his own attack, BBC News has reported, and the star told Good Morning America last week that he was “p***ed off” at the “lies” which were being spread about him online.

Two men were detained last week in relation to the attack but have since been released, NBC reported on February 15.

A Chicago police spokesperson told NBC: “Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues.”

Smollett, who came out as gay on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2015, was attacked at approximately 2am on E. North Lower Water Street last month.

Smollett was reportedly branded a “faggot Empire n****r” and had a noose tied around his neck by two men who shouted the pro-Trump acronym “MAGA,” which stands for “Make America Great Again.”

Detectives are treating the assault as a potential hate crime.

It was reported earlier this month that the FBI is searching for the people responsible for sending Smollett hate mail days before he was assaulted in Chicago.

One of the hateful letters sent to Smollett reportedly called him a “black fag,” according to TMZ."

A Tennessee man was arrested Tuesday for pulling a gun on a couple who were wearing the Make America Great Again hats popularized by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

James Phillips, 57, of Cottontown, Tenn., was charged with first-degree wanton endangerment after he reportedly pulled the gun in a Kentucky Sam’s Club store amid an argument, according to his arrest citation. Phillips allegedly told the woman, “It’s a good day to die, b****,” and exchanged obscene hand gestures with the man. He said he did so because of their hats.

Phillips, who wore a hat indicating he was a military veteran, has a concealed-carry permit for his gun.

The incident comes amid the continuing controversy over Empire actor Jussie Smollett’s claim that he was beaten and left with a noose around his neck by two men shouting pro-Trump slogans, which has been increasingly scrutinized as a possible hoax.

TMZ reports that ‘Empire’ producers have cut several of Smollett’s scenes from an episode filming this week –– the second-to-last of the season. According to the report, producers have cut five of nine scenes featuring Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon and reduced his role in the remaining four. Smollett was supposed to perform a musical number in a scene but that has also been cut.

Smollett claimed that he was accosted by two men in the early morning hours of January 29 who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor, allegedly tying a rope around his neck and throwing a chemical, possibly bleach, on him.

Smollett’s account has come under scrutiny after authorities arrested two men last week who were seen on surveillance camera footage near the scene of the alleged attack, which was not recorded. Detectives reportedly interviewed and released the two men, who are cooperating with investigators.

Although Chicago police have not said that Smollett is suspected of orchestrating the attack and/or filing a false police report, unidentified law enforcement sources who have spoken to the media say that Smollett paid the two men $3,500 each to participate in the attack, and offered them an additional $500 when they returned to the U.S. from a trip to Nigeria. It is unclear why the two men, who were reportedly born in Chicago, left the country that day after the alleged assault.

Law enforcement sources reportedly told TMZ that a grand jury is expected to meet over the allegations of a possible hoax, and that Smollett could be facing felony charges if it turns out the attack was orchestrated. Authorities have not said publicly that Smollett is a suspect; only that investigators wish to speak to him again. It is not clear if Smollett has yet arranged to meet with the police.

Smollett, who stars in the show Empire, made headlines January 29 after claiming he was the victim of a prejudice-motivated attack. But while his story has unraveled during the past week — with an allegation that he paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the assault — his claims were never plausible.

This didn’t stop pseudo-elite establishment types, in media, politics, and beyond, from believing a tale that sounded like a puerile, politically correct Hollywood script. To wit: At 2 a.m., on a Chicago night with a wind chill the better part of minus 20, in a liberal neighborhood that’s largely black and homosexual, two white guys attacked Smollett — yelling slurs relating to his race and sexual bent — and then splashed him with bleach and tied a rope around his neck.

So they just happened to be carrying bleach and a rope because, well, like the American Express card, you just don’t leave home without them.

The kicker? Smollett was still wearing the rope when the police arrived at his apartment 45 minutes later.

Oh, the alleged attackers also yelled “This is MAGA country!” — in Chicago — where 88 percent of the electorate voted against President Trump. Now that’s the hate-crime-hoax version of jumping the shark.

Nonetheless, fellow actors, the whole mainstream media, and presidential contenders and other politicos jumped on the condemn-America/Trump/white people bandwagon.

For example, when White House hopeful Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was asked yesterday about Smollett’s sleight-of-hand, she soberly replied, “I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

Strangely, though, this circumspection was sorely absent January 29 when, before the story was even a day old, she sent the following tweet:

Fellow presidential hopeful Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also experienced an upwelling of prudence, on Sunday, when he responded to the Smollett revelations. “I’m gonna withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources,” said he.

Yet even before Harris weighed in, he’d tweeted:

I’d no idea lynching was legal. Regardless, Senator Booker, how about now proposing anti-hate-crime-hoaxing legislation?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) quietly deleted her Smollett-supporting tweet. Actress and singer Ariana Grande’s is still up, reading, “what happened to jussie makes me really f[******] sick to my stomach. i can’t believe s[***] like this is really still happening everyday [sic]. what kind of world ? sending all of the healing energy / love i possibly can and hoping for change. what can we do ? tell me & i’m there.”

Okay: Stop being vulgar and learn to capitalize and apply logic. Also, pro tip: If you “can’t believe s[***] like this is really still happening every day,” it perhaps should occur to you that maybe it’s not.

Interestingly, the media had just been down Politically Correct Road and Malpractice Lane just over a week before, participating in the hate-fest against the Covington Catholic High School boys. In that case, hapless 16-year-old, MAGA-hatted student Nick Sandmann was portrayed as the face of hate based on a 60-second, out-of-context video, and he and his schoolmates endured scorn and threats of serious violence.

When it became obvious the Covington boys were actually innocent victims of an apparent professional-agitator setup — a “hoax,” if you will — the media lost interest before shortly thereafter taking the side of the latest hoaxer, Smollett.

The naïve might wonder why the media didn’t “learn their lesson.” But they didn’t “learn” after the first few hundred leftist-perpetrated hate-crime hoaxes. Why should this one be any different?

It wouldn’t be because, you see, the media are complicit in the hoaxing — in a sense. No, they don’t know the truth on every given case, but they do either know the patterns and just don’t care or are shamefully negligent in not knowing.

Ever since the Tawana Brawley hoax in 1987 — in which a black teen girl claimed to have been raped for days by four white men — there has been an increasing number of false hate-crime allegations made by “minorities” (e.g., blacks, homosexuals, the LGBT crowd in general, etc.). Concurrently, there have been a perhaps increasing number of actual “hate crimes” against whites, as Professor Thomas Sowell relates here and here. Yet the media behave as if real life is ever Mississippi Burning — and it’s always 1964.

A prerequisite for learning is caring about improvement, but the media don’t. They’re content with their prejudices: white/conservative/Christian/male/heterosexual=oppressor and bad. The more of those labels you wear, the more harshly you’re judged.

Non-white/liberal/non-Christian/female/LGBTQ=victim and good. The more of those labels you wear, the more kindly you’re treated. Believability isn’t about the content of your character (as it should be) but the color of your skin.

Some in the media have truly fooled themselves, while others are just trying to fool you. What they share is that they have their narrative and are stickin’ to it. They just need to, like a shyster lawyer, present a case that will make you accept it, too.

(It doesn’t help that, as PJ Media points out, leftist reporters also exhibit “confirmation bias” and what Sowell called “arrogant ignorance.”)

A case in point was Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts, who threw softballs while interviewing Smollett in a segment broadcast last Thursday. The actor, acting, shamelessly attacked those disbelieving his story as he told “us that he represents the most despised and unfashionable groups in America,” as Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson put it last night. Yet mentioning how the establishment rallied to Smollett’s side, Carlson asked, “Is this the treatment that marginalized people receive?”

“Smollett isn’t powerless; far from it,” Carlson continued (video below). “His power lies in pretending that he has no power. In fact, Jussie Smollett and his promoters are the aggressors in this story. They launched a calculated campaign of slander against an entire group of people who have far less wealth and far less cultural influence than they have.” That would be, mind you, people such as the Covington kids.

Exhibiting a sociopath-level lack of conscience, Smollett also complained in his interview about “people who are trying to separate us.” He should look in the mirror.

Make no mistake, if we accept the “hate crime” concept (which I don’t, but that is a different topic), then false hate-crime accusations themselves should be considered hate crimes. After all, hatred of the implicated group often partially or completely motivates hate-crime hoaxers.

Note, too, that the major justification for hate-crime laws is that such acts “target whole communities.” Yet so do hate-crime hoaxes, as they put an onus on whites, conservatives, or Trump supporters — on whatever “victimizer” group is in the cross hairs.

Such hoaxes are also truly evil acts. They create suspicion, division, and animosity and can lead to racial unrest, rioting, and “revenge attacks” on whites. Remember that racial and ethnic strife has killed millions throughout history; stoking its fires can put a nation asunder. Thus should hate-crime hoaxers be punished harshly. In reality, though, they’re rarely if ever punished at all.

As to who really has the privilege, the Smollett and Covington affairs tell the tale. The actor had the entire establishment on his side, with senators complaining of a lynching. And the pro-life Catholic teens?

They were condemned by the establishment and chased by a lynch mob. With privilege like that, who needs prejudice?

A new report surfaced in the past few days that named two Nigerian brothers Olabingo and Abimbola Osundairo as the men featured in a surveillance video near where Smollett was attacked. The brothers have reportedly been cooperating with police in regards to the Jan. 29 attack on the Empire actor.

During his Sunday night PoliticsNation show, Sharpton said:

“I, among many others when hearing of the (original) report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said

“I still maintain that. And if it is found that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum,” he said.

“But let’s not act like this is some left-wing hoax that some are saying on social media. President Trump called this ‘horrible,’ and he’s certainly not a left-winger,” Sharpton said.

“None of us talked directly with (Smollett). We were alarmed at what was reported,” he said.

“Let us get to the bottom of it and let justice be done. No matter who is right or wrong, we cannot not get to the truth here,” Sharpton said.

Sharpton, a civil rights activist, was one of the first to come to Smollett’s defense when reports of the attack surfaced.

—Iconic Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld has died at 85—

On Monday the brothers released a statement:

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,” they said. “We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Sources reportedly told CBS 2 Chicago and ABC News that Smollett enlisted the Osundairo because he was upset that a threatening letter that was sent to him on the set of Empire in Chicago didn’t conjure up the reaction he wanted.

Other the weekend, Smollet’s lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement denying that the actor took an active role in the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Empire executive producer on “Empire,” Brett Mahoney, tweeted his continued support of the TV star late Sunday.

“I believe and stand by JussieSmollett . Keep your head up,” he wrote in the post."

This time, she feels hurt and betrayed over reports that Jussie Smollett staged his own assault.

She also says that it's possible that the police are framing Jussie ... which she can believe because she says that police once framed her.

""I’m really disappointed in him,"" Cardi says of Jussie Smollett on Instagram Live. ""I feel like he f--ked up Black History Month, bro. Like, damn.""

""I’m not gonna say, yet,"" she notes. ""Until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the shit was staged,""

""I don’t want to completely blame him,"" Cardi adds.

She explains that her reluctance is ""because somebody I was talking to they said police in Chicago are racists.”

The Chicago PD is infamous, even among other metropolitan police departmants.

(It took 13 months for the police to release dash cam video that showed Laquan McDonald walking away from police, proving that his death was a murder)

“So,"" Cardi suggests. ""They might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.""

""But if he’s not,"" Cardi continues. ""Then bro you f--ked up, for real.""

""Like, why would you do that?"" she asks.

A staged hate crime, especially one so famous, will be used as fodder to cast doubt on future real hate crime reports.

""You got Donald Trump immunity to f--king laugh,"" Cardi accuses.

Cardi laments: ""You make motherf--kers look bad.""

""You know why I want to give him the benefit of the doubt?"" Cardi rhetorically asks her followers.

""I remember about 2 years ago ... my cousin got into an argument with this boy, this guy, like road rage,"" she says.

""And my cousin got out of the car,"" she narrates. ""And I got out of the car.""

""And you know I'm always throwing s--t,"" Cardi notes. ""So I threw the guy a bottle of water.""

""And the guy,"" she says. ""He doesn't really want to fight my cousin, he wants to really fight me.""

""So, the police came, and they put me in like, a headlock,"" Cardi accuses.

""I got on Instagram,"" she notes. ""And said how the police got me in a headlock.""

""And since I went on Instagram, I had 12 come into my home, calling my phone, leaving me letters saying that I have to speak to them,"" she describes.

Various police departments have been accused of using intimidation tactics, even agaist celebrities, in order to cover for wrongdoings.

""And then, when I didn't speak to them, I went to my grandmother's house,"" Cardi claims.

Cardi says that police were ""trying to harass my cousin and everybody to talk to them.""

""And since I never gave a statement to the police,"" she says. ""They put out a statement saying that I did it to promote my album""

""So,"" Cardi explains. ""I don't wanna call Jussie Smollett a complete liar.""

""But they do claim that they have evidence from both the brothers [to whom they spoke],"" she notes.

""I don't know,"" Cardi admits. ""I want to see what else.""

Don't we all.

""Because if he did that ... he really f--ked up, bro,"" Cardi says. ""This February, you have so many people standing for you.""

""I mean, why would you do that, bro?"" she asks.

Maybe the weirdest thing about 2019 is how deeply relatable Cardi B's viral rants, whether they're about Jussie or politics, have been.

Like Cardi, we are incredibly disappointed at reports that Jussie staged his own attack.

As she says, this could be used against the black acommunity and the LGBTQ+ community, and is political fodder for Trump.

That said, like Cardi, we have heard troubling things about the Chicago Police Department.

We would all like to have a clearer picture of the evidence before rendering our judgment."

This weekend, when the Chicago Police Department released information suggesting that Empire actor Jussie Smollett helped stage an alleged racist and homophobic violent attack on Jan. 29, the general public and many initial supporters denounced the actor. Despite whether or not these claims are true, others — particularly those who have had firsthand experience with the notorious police department — believe that we shouldn’t be too quick to trust the information that they’re releasing.

One such person is Charlene Carruthers, a subject of our March cover story, a longtime community organizer in Chicago, and author of Unapologetic: A Black, Queer, and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements. In this interview with Out, she shares her personal experiences with the CPD, why our communities need solutions to violence and harm that don’t revolve around policing, and how the conflicting reports are impacting the local community.

What was your initial reaction when you first learned about the Jussie Smollett attack?

I was shocked, sad, and angry because I know the dominant narrative about white supremacist violence skips over the long history of that type of violence against Black people in Chicago. As a Black person who’s a part of the LGBTQ community, I was afraid. If this could happen to him, it could happen to me. It could happen to somebody I know and care about.

When the CPD initially announced the attack would be investigated as a hate crime, what were your thoughts?

I fundamentally do not belief that our city, state, [or] federal government can give Black people justice and that the policies and laws that allow people to be tried for hate crimes and be found guilty of them is a system that consistently falls short for our people. So, I wasn’t excited or optimistic when I heard the reports that [the assailants] could be charged with a hate crime because when Black people experience violence from anyone there’s no guarantee that there’s going to be restoration or accountability for it. If someone is found guilty of a hate crime, that doesn’t automatically mean that the person or people who experience that violence will ever get the care or justice that they need. Hate crimes [legislation] is woefully insufficient in delivering justice, and it actually doesn’t prevent people from committing acts of violence against other people when it’s motivated by white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, and anti-Blackness.

What should the general public understand about the CPD?

Fundamentally, the CPD on a day-to-day basis does not operate as an entity that keeps us safe as Black people or queer folk. We have examples of Black men in Chicago being victimized, brutalized, harassed, and harmed by the CPD. I don’t feel safe by the hyper presence of the CPD in the neighborhood I grew up in in Chicago. The second thing people should know is that they have a very low clearance rate in actually determining who committed certain acts of violence against other people, particularly in Black neighborhoods. Even though they receive nearly 40 percent of the public service budget in Chicago, they actually are a very ineffective force in preventing or even solving instances of violence that people, particularly Black folks, experience in our neighborhoods.

Lastly, I think it’s important to note that the CPD has been under the scrutiny of local and federal government agencies. It was investigated in order to determine a pattern of not just abuse, but one of reasonable and unlawful force when they were considering a consent decree for Chicago. Just a couple years ago, survivors of police torture received reparations from the city of Chicago. It was the first ordinance of this nature for Black people in this country, in our history. It’s not just speculation — the city [government] of Chicago has recognized the capacity and the actual actions of the CPD to torture Black people. We should always approach the CPD with skepticism and I think our work is to really think about why we don’t have another [accountability] body that can look at the stories and reports and determine the information for our folks.

What are some of the solutions you advise to people who may have been attacked, but are worried about reaching out to the police?

People who are survivors of sexual violence don’t report because they know that more often than not, they’re not going to be believed [or] they are actually going to be criminalized by the police. I think we all should turn our energy towards community-based organizations and institutions rooted in restorative and transformative justice. An unfortunate truth is that we don’t have enough [of them] and our city spends more [money] on policing than it does on mental healthcare. Our city prioritizes policing over community-based safety programming. So, for people who experience these things, the sad reality is our government is not in a position to help people actually experience justice. We have to turn our righteous sadness and anger into organizing to have the services and institutions our people deserve.

What do you make of the detail about Jussie initially deciding to not turn over their phone to the CPD?

It comes as no surprise that someone wouldn’t want to turn over their phone to a police department in this country. I have no idea exactly why he didn’t, I can only speculate. And I can relate. I wouldn’t want to turn my phone over to the police department. Black folks in Chicago have a knowledge and history of knowing the CPD have on many occasions planted information and various things on folks that they didn’t have and turned out to be harmful to the person. We know this goes beyond Chicago. Almost any city in this country, where there are Black people, there’s a level of skepticism. I think people should not use the decision Jussie made to not turn his phone over as fodder to say [his report] isn’t true. That’s not fair grounds given the pattern of behavior that the CPD has historically demonstrated.

What are organizers and Chicagoans saying locally about the Jussie Smollett attack?

I think a lot of people are in a state of dismay, sadness, and anger because when you hear a story as visceral as this one, you want to do something about it. Then, hearing conflicting accounts confuses people. People just want to know what happened and they want anybody, including Jussie, to actually be well if they experience something like this. I think people are moving from a place of compassion. And they’re confused because, on one hand, we know we can’t trust CPD and, on the other hand, we’re receiving conflicting information about what happened or not. I think that’s also a tool that’s often deployed in our community and the truth is Black LGBTQ folks experience violence all too often.

What do you think the media has been getting wrong about this situation?

My perception is everybody in media wants to be first in breaking the news. In that process, even minor things will be wrong including time, dates, and arcs. Some outlets will say that Jussie was a victim of a white supremacist attack while ignoring the reports of homophobia and some will solely focus on the homophobic parts and not note that this was a Black man. Many [outlets] fail in even telling a fuller arc. I think it prevents people from seeing themselves in it — Black folks at large who are not in the LGBTQ community and the LGBTQ folks who are not Black. Now, there’s all types of reports everywhere. Based on the information I do have, I hope Jussie gets what he needs whatever that is.

What do you think the repercussions on the Right will be, or what have you seen, in terms of not automatically wanting to believe him as a victim?

I think people will find it even more convenient to ignore how Black folks in the LGBTQ community experience various forms of violence from people they’re in relationship with, people they don’t know, the government, the police department, and the healthcare system. Homelessness is violence. Poverty is violence. In the neighborhood I live in, I see what Black folks, especially Black trans women, are faced with every single day when it comes to safety, housing, and employment. People could use this [instance] as even more fodder to not believe what’s happening to people, which in turn impacts politics, how budgets run, and how people treat people they encounter every day.

Contextualizing this into the larger Trump Era, where do you think this situation lives within it?

I think it really taps into a lot of the fears I carry with me every day. I live in Chicago, and it’s a northern city that’s supposed to be ‘Democratic with a big D’ and folks are supposed to be fairly progressive or liberal, but it just adds to the anxiety and fear I have for myself and the people I care about. Living in this time with [Donald] Trump as president, and the people who support him being validated on an international level, it adds to that anxiety. It shines a light on the work we still have to do.

I’m a little more optimistic than usual to see how many people — because of their relationship to Jussie and his celebrity — actually spoke out against [the attack] and said something. People don’t have to say anything, but I do think so much of why we’re even talking about this is because he’s a celebrity, visible, and so many other visible people are in relationship to him. It wouldn’t even be a story if it was any other given Black person in the LGBTQ community. It gives us an opportunity to highlight what else is happening in our community and connect it to broader systemic issues. Our work as organizers or activists is to lift up the stories of the people who are typically ignored and erased.

Do you trust the CPD with this investigation and do you think the public should?

No, I am clear in this moment that we may or may not ever find out what actually happened. People have to be at peace with that and it’s actually up to Jussie to determine what he actually does and needs — no matter what results come out of all of this.

I want to ask you a question about this guy, just to get him in your head. Think about a guy who does this … No matter what Shapiro says, I’m not that old, and yet I’m old enough to remember the first black everything — the first black anything I remember, in showbiz: the first black guy on TV, the first black guy to have a series, the first black woman to have a series. Jussie Smollett did none of that, he did none of it okay? I remember when gay people could be arrested for being gay, that was in my lifetime! Gay people could be arrested just for being gay; that was a vice.

Jussie Smollett didn’t change any of that, he’s too young, he wasn’t there, his life is a gift. His life is he walks in and “Oh, you’re gonna play the gay guy, so you’re gonna play the gay black guy on ‘Empire’ and make whatever incredible amount of money you’re making for pretending to be that guy, and we’re gonna tell a story about you in which you’ll be very sympathetic and you’ll be a hero.” Jussie Smollett should be waking up every morning saying, “What a great country! I love everything, everything is great, everything is tickety-boo, this is terrific.” Instead, it is important to him — think about this for a minute — he needs to be a victim, he needs to say, “Oh I was attacked, I was threatened, I was endangered, people threw bleach and called me names.” He needs that so badly. If this story is true — and I know we don’t know this for a fact yet, but the story up till now has been implausible and now it’s a lot more plausible — but if this story is true, that’s what was important to him. No gratitude for who he is or what’s happened to him or the people who went before him who made his life possible, just “It’s still going on.”

Everybody likes to think that they have struggled and succeeded at things. I always love it when guys stand up in an award show and they’ve won the Oscar or the Grammy or something — one of these self-congratulating things that showbiz is rife with — and they say, “They told us it couldn’t be done.” And I always think, “I would like the names of anyone who told you it couldn’t be done.” Who tells people things can’t be done in this country? Anything, virtually, can be done in this country. Donald Trump is president! Anything can happen in this country. Nobody got in your way, nobody got in Jussie Smollett’s way. Does he get hate mail? Yeah, I get hate mail, everybody gets hate mail. It’s a crazy country, everybody has access to everybody, we all get lies told about us and horrible things said about us, but that’s the narrative that he is living in, it’s a left-wing narrative.

Not only does it shade the way people tell the truth, but it also keeps people from telling the truth. Not only does it shade the way they report the facts, but it keeps people from saying the facts.

“That’s right, the police now believe Smollett staged his own attack, which would be insane, but you have to admit, there’s a certain part of the story that was always a little weird,” Noah said. “Like, who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch ‘Empire’?

Jussie Smollett‘s role on Empire is reportedly being reduced over claims that the actor orchestrated his own attack in Chicago.

READ: Report: Chicago Police Claim Jussie Smollett Staged His Own Attack

According to TMZ, Smollett was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to last episode but five of those scenes, as well as the musical number, have been cut. The episode is currently being shot.

The report continues: “As for the remaining 4 scenes…we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.”

TMZ goes on to report that Smollett is no longer working on set every day this week and that writers for the show have been busy making edits to the script.

Smollett portrays Jamal Lyon on the TV series.

Smollett’s alleged attack has grown more and more complicated since it was first reported. After disputing the attack as a hoax, Chicago police now believe the actor staged his own attack after speaking with two brothers that claim Smollett hired them for the attack.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were brought in on Wednesday as the lead suspects in the incident. After a round of interviewing and the threat of being charged with battery, the Osundairo brothers claimed that Smollet hired them to participate in the staged attack, paying them $4,000 for their assistance. They went on to paint a drastically differed picture of the incident, claiming to have bought the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a local hardware store and the red imitation MAGA hats at a beauty supply. They even rehearsed the attack a few days prior.

Smollett has yet to directly address the new developments, but is cooperating with CPD investigators in new rounds of interviews.

Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) for her awkward response to questions about her tweet calling the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett a ""modern-day lynching.""

2020 Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on the alleged attack of Smollett, a gay, black actor, after he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime in late January. He initially alleged two men beat him up in a Chicago street, poured bleach on him, placed a rope around his neck, and yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan. However, the narrative changed over the weekend when it was reported Chicago Police are now investigating whether he orchestrated his own attack. Authorities suspect the actor paid two brothers, who are now cooperating fully with law enforcement, to carry out the purported attack.

""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski played a clip of a reporter asking Harris about her tweet from Jan. 29 reacting to Smollett's initial story. She praised Smollett in the tweet as ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings"" she knows. ""This was an attempted modern day lynching,"" she added.

""Which tweet? What tweet?"" Harris asked the reporter during an appearance at a bookstore in Concord, New Hampshire.

""About saying that it is a ‘modern day lynching,'"" the reporter said, prompting Harris to look to her left for an unknown reason and laughing before facing the reporter again, who added, ""Jussie Smollet.""

""Um, uh, OK, so, I will say this about that case. I think that the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um, concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened,"" Harris said, according to the Fox News report.

She went on to say everyone could comment after an investigation has been completed.

""And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation,"" she said.

Co-host Joe Scarborough responded to clip by saying Harris looked like she didn't know anything about the tweet. He then quickly clarified that he wasn't making any excuses for her and that ""the buck stops with her.""

Mike Barnicle, a frequent ""Morning Joe"" guest agreed with Scarborough and said she did ""as well as you can do"" in a moment when you don't have a response. He then proceeded to imitate Harris's gestures.

Guest Tom Nichols, explaining he was once a Senate staffer, warned Harris against throwing her staffers under the bus for the tweet.

Brzezinski said if the 2020 hopeful did send the tweet herself, she needs to take full ownership.

""Do you really think these candidates are tweeting 24/7? No. They have people tweeting for them and let me tell you, ‘Stop.' Only tweet when you're tweeting. It's not going to work otherwise,"" Brzezinski said. ""When you have people tweeting for you. Ooh. It's not helpful, and something like that will happen. If she did tweet that, she's going to have to completely roll it back and take ownership for it.""

She further warned about jumping to conclusions when it comes to the Smollett case, advice many in the media didn't heed in their immediate response to the actor's accusations.

""We don't know what happened, and this is a problem. Everyone thinks mob rule is where we are going to go. It's not going to work in the elections. It's not going to work for Democrats,"" Brzezinski said."

Smollett told Chicago police he was attacked last month by two masked men who cried ""this is MAGA country"" while carrying out a hate crime. The story has changed, however, as sources claimed that Smollett had orchestrated the attack himself. On Sunday, the president's eldest son weighed in, apparently amused by the whole story.

Trump Jr. employed a popular meme format for his tweet, and referenced the case of comedian Kathy Griffin.

""Kathy Griffin: No one can ruin a career faster than I can,"" Trump Jr. wrote. ""Jussie Smollett: Hold my bleach!!!""

The fictional dialogue did not sit well with many people, who felt that Trump Jr. was making light of a serious and nuanced situation. One of the first to respond was Griffin herself. The comedian was condemned in 2017 when she posted a photo of herself holding a mask that looked like the severed head of President Donald Trump. She retweeted Trump Jr.'s post with a comment of her own on Sunday.

""You really showed me,"" Griffin added with a laughing crying emoji. In another tweet, she mocked Trump Jr. for not tagging her in his initial tweet, accusing him of cowardice.

The response to President Trump she referenced was in regards to his post about Saturday Night Live this weekend. The president accused the show of ""real Collusion"" and threatened ""retribution.""

""You tried with me, went through all the paces to try to violate my 1st amendment rights, and... EPIC FAIL,"" Griffin replied.

Hey Hollywood and media types, I’ve noticed a lot of you deleted your #JusticeForJussie tweets... what’s the matter, don’t you want justice for him anymore??? #frauds — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 18, 2019



Trump Jr. posted many other memes, articles and commentary on the Smollett case over the holiday weekend, tracing the responses of politicians and celebrities. One post was removed from Instagram, and Trump Jr. said that the platform itself took it down. He accused the Facebook-owned social media app of trying to ""censor any conservative voices."" A representative for Instagram later told Breitbart that it was taken down ""in error.""

Smollett's case is still under investigation, and police have not yet accused the actor of orchestrating his own attack. However, on Tuesday morning TMZ reported that Smollett's screen time is getting significantly reduced."

Scenes featuring Jussie Smollett on the TV show “Empire” have been drastically cut amid the apparent unraveling of his tale about being the victim of a hate attack, according to reports Tuesday.

The actor, who plays singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox show, was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical performance in the second-to-last episode of Season 5, production sources told TMZ.

But five scenes and the musical number have been axed, the site reported.

Smollett’s character is also no longer the focus of his remaining four scenes, which will now feature an ensemble of characters, the report said.

The 36-year-old actor is spending far less time on set as a result, the report said.

He’ll be working Friday and possibly Thursday but won’t be rehearsing.

“Empire” writers have been scrambling over the past days to revise this season’s scripts.

Smollett claims he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack near his Chicago apartment Jan. 29, but suspicion has since emerged that he offered to pay two friends — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — $4,000 to help stage the assault.

According to Deadline Hollywood, there are no plans yet to make any changes to the remaining episodes that have already been filmed.

Filming for “Empire” resumed Tuesday, with the series set to return to TV on March 13, Deadline reported.

On Monday, the show’s executive producer Brett Mahoney reiterated his support for the embattled actor.

“I believe and stand by @JussieSmollett . Keep your head up. @EmpireWriters @EmpireFOX,” Mahoney tweeted.

Mahoney has stayed consistent in his support of Smollett, first responding to the attack at Fox’s TCA presentation on Feb. 6.

“Jussie is a proud, gay black man, and I’m not sure if the cowards were trying to beat the pride, gay or black out of him but he’s strong and we’re happy he’s back at work,” Mahoney said on stage at the event.

Last week, speculation swirled that Smollett may have staged the attack because he was being written off the show — a rumor that was quickly slapped down by Fox executives.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of ‘Empire’ is patently ridiculous,” said 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment in a statement at the time.

“He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

Among those is Kevin Fallon, a senior entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast. In a tweet posted on Monday, Fallon said he had deleted his “previous inaccurate tweets” and called the potential hoax “a despicable act if updates are true”:

I deleted previous inaccurate tweets as more reports about Jussie Smollett come out. What a despicable act if updates are true: exploiting & amplifying the hate, division, & politicization; abusing media & police resources; and making it all the harder for victims to report. — Kevin Fallon (@kpfallon) February 19, 2019

In his first tweet, Fallon wrote, “People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that “faggot” from Empire. Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.”

In a follow-up tweet he wrote: “Update after learning more: they wore ski masks, so as to cowardly not be recognized as they shouted ‘this is MAGA country’ and toed a rope around his neck like a noose.”

With reports rolling in that indicate Smollett may have orchestrated the attack, it’s not just media members who are having to backtrack. Presidential candidate and Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) — who tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching” — was asked about the new developments while in New Hampshire.

She stated: “Okay. So I will say this about that. I think the facts are still unfolding. I’m very concerned about it obviously.”

Even though it should not be unusual for police trying to piece together an alleged crime they did not witness might have to revise their working theory of what happened, Butler suggested that the cops are the ones who are untrustworthy because, unlike Smollett, they have had a ""shifting"" story.

Butler gave his flaky analysis twice on Sunday -- appearing once on Up with David Gura, and again later on MSNBC Live with Ayman Mohyeldin.

Shortly after 9:00 a.m., after Gura asked for his reaction, Butler began: ""So Jussie's story has been consistent from the beginning. It's the police who have shifting accounts. On Friday, they said that they had probable cause to believe that these two men had committed the crime, and now apparently they don't.""

He continued: ""I think we are probably never going to know exactly what happened, which makes this more like other cases.""

After recalling that law enforcement fails to solve most crimes, he pivoted to encouraging audience members to trust people who claim to be victims, and recalled FBI reports that hate crimes have increased in recent years.

As Butler appeared again later in the day, he gave similar analysis: ""For the record, Jussie Smollett -- his statement stayed the same, so he has been consistent, so it's really the police department that has had shifting versions of what they think happened."""

He only put into practice what liberals and the social justice movement preach.

Chicago police are requesting another interview with Smollett, reportedly because new evidence suggests he staged the incident and paid two black men, whom he knew, to make it look like he was brutally assaulted. The story was going to be that supporters of President Trump doused him in bleached and hung a noose around his neck in public late one night. Though strange, the story held up for nearly 20 days, until police tracked down the men involved.

But back to Smollett, because he is both black and gay he could count on the fact that the hoax would check two of the social justice hierarchy’s most prized status boxes.

When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who is running for president, tweeted in December that “Our future is: Female, Intersectional, Powered by our belief in one another. And we’re just getting started,” this is more or less what she was referring to. The more societal oppression someone can claim, we call it “intersectionality,” the more morally correct he is assumed to be, and the more valid his viewpoint. That was evidenced by the outpouring of solidarity, encouragement and support for Smollett by Hollywood, Democrats and the news media after he first made his dubious claim about the alleged attack.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted, “This attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.”

CNN host Brooke Baldwin on air described the alleged assault as “absolutely despicable,” adding that “hopefully the police run this down really quickly.”

Actress Emma Watson tweeted, “Disgusted by the ugly prejudice and bigotry behind this violence. Sending love to @JussieSmollett & to anyone that has been hurt by the hatred of those who fear difference.""

Liberal American culture, which is largely to say Hollywood and the news media, rewards anyone who can claim to be a victim of societal oppression. And the more of a victim you are, the better. And how much more of a victim can you be than a gay black man beat up by Trump supporters?! Jackpot!

As to why Smollett would fake the attack, aside from just the positive attention due to intersectionality, there are some reports that his character on the Fox show “Empire” was being written out of the storyline. This might have been an attempt to raise his profile ahead of the end of this run.

Fox denied that rumor, but even if his character weren’t being killed off, Smollett had nothing to lose and everything to gain by claiming to have been a victim of violent racism and homophobia. After the initial report, everyone in America knew his name. The cultural giants of the media, Hollywood and the Democratic Party were turning him into a martyr.

Smollett aspired to the heights of victimhood, just as liberals and the social justice movement have taught him."

According to TMZ, inside production sources revealed the series’ creators decided to completely change nine of the actor’s key scenes in the upcoming episodes, as well as downplay his role in a big musical that’s in the making. Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, one of Terrance Howard’s character’s sons. Jamal is an openly gay singer in Empire, much like the actor is in real life.

The Fox show is currently in Season 5, and its last episode aired on December 5, but it is set to return to the small screen sometime in the spring. However, its 10th episode’s airing date has not been confirmed yet, and the final episodes are currently being shot.

The 36-year-old actor, who was allegedly attacked on January 29 by two men wearing ski masks, was supposed to play a prominent role in at least nine scenes, and even have his own musical, but he has now been given fewer responsibilities and will share the screen with other characters, according to the sources. Yet, it is worth noting that the insiders could not fully confirm whether his part as Jamal would be completely written out of the show. TMZ also reports that he is working on set this week but is only required there on Friday and possibly on Thursday, too. On Monday, Fox representatives refused to comment on whether Smollett’s role had been affected by the current police investigation, which has taken a very surprising turn in recent days.

On Monday, it was claimed that he may now be facing charges for filing a false police report regarding the attack he states he suffered amid rumors that he paid the two men to assault him. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, he told police he was attacked at around 2 a.m. near a subway in Chicago by two ski mask-clad men who shouted racist and homophobic abuse at him. According to him, the assailants beat him up, tied a rope noose around his neck, and poured a bleach-like substance on him. He said that the insults used included “this is MAGA country,” “Empire f****t,” and “Empire n*****.”

The men — who attorney Gloria Schmidt identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.”

In a joint statement issued to CNN affiliate WBBM, the men said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Police say they want to talk to Smollett again. The actor’s reps said Smollett would not be speaking to police Monday, and it’s unclear when he will sit down with investigators.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today,” Anne Kavanaugh with Media Pros 24/7 said.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

The sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett identifies as gay and since 2015 has played the gay character of Jamal on the Fox TV drama “Empire.”

What happened

According to Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the actor told detectives he was attacked by two men near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago. Police were told the two men yelled “‘Empire’ fa***t” and “‘Empire’ n***er'” while striking him.

In a supplemental interview with authorities, Smollett confirmed media reports that one of the attackers also shouted, “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

The day after the incident, police released surveillance images that showed two silhouetted individuals walking down a sidewalk, and police said they were wanted for questioning.

Police on Friday said the men were being viewed as “potential suspects” and that detectives had “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.”

But by Friday night they had been released, Guglielmi said, “due to new evidence as a result of today’s investigations.”

“And detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” he added.

One of the men has appeared on “Empire,” Guglielmi said. A police source also told CNN on Friday night that the men had a previous affiliation with Smollett, but did not provide additional details.

Smollett has expressed frustration about not being believed

Following the alleged attack, Smollett’s colleagues and fans rallied around him, expressing shock and sadness.

“We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows that we are united on a united front,” Lee Daniels, the creator of “Empire,” said in a video posted to his Instagram page on January 29. “And no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you. Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you.”

Smollett gave his first detailed account of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that aired Thursday.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Smollett stated that one of the attackers shouted “this is MAGA country” before punching him in the face. But he refuted reports that said he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”"

I would like to report a hate crime. I was sitting around, minding my own business, when suddenly I was attacked by a gang of thugs, screaming racist and anti-Republican slurs.

One of these animals, a raving white woman with the dead eyes of a zombie, screeched in my face, “If you voted for Donald Trump because you didn’t like Hillary Clinton, that doesn’t make you not racist, that makes you racist!” She then put a noose around my neck, but she worked for CNN so I think it was a fake noose.

After that, an African American man with the bizarre twitch of saying the word racist over and over again for no apparent reason, screamed at me, “We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men!” Luckily I was able to knock him unconscious, which seemed to make absolutely no difference in the intelligence level of his remarks.

After that, a crazy old Caucasian woman with a bottle of Chardonnay gripped tightly in her fist staggered out of the mob and bellowed, “You and your kind are deplorable racists and haters!” She then attempted to throw bleach at me, but it turned out to be bleach-bit, which only erased all the information in my cell phone, which she then tried to smash with a hammer thinking it was her cell phone because she was drunk out of her mind.

Police are interviewing several people of interest, including Kirstin Powers, Don Lemon and Hillary Clinton, and they are now saying that someone may have hired these people to launch these mindless attacks on me, namely CNN and the rest of the Democrat Party.

Already, this vicious attack is being compared to the attack on actor Jussie Smollett in Chicago, although one significant difference between the two incidents has emerged. News organizations have not yet reported on that difference, because none of them has found the time to look up the meaning of the word reality."

Knowles explains why the Left promotes this kind of victimhood and how it impacts conservatives. Transcript and video below.

What Jussie Smollett did was commit a real hate crime against white people, and against straight people and against conservatives and Trump supporters. He committed a crime against us. He smeared us, he spread calumny, he defamed us. He filed a false police report it seems like. Those are real crimes. This is not a victimless crime. He did something very wrong. He could go to jail for this by the way. As he should if he is guilty. The networks spent, according to Newsbusters, 101 minutes breathlessly covering this story before it fell apart.

We buy this, and by “we” I don’t mean “we”: I mean the Left and half of America and the mainstream media and presidential candidates and Nancy Pelosi. We buy this because we buy the cultural narrative that marginalized people are hopelessly oppressed in this country, that it’s a horrific country that is always trying to kill them. Not just oppress them, but kill them!

There was a headline in the Washington Post that read “I doubted Jussie Smollett, it breaks my heart that I might be right.” It breaks your heart that half the country isn’t anti-black white racists who are trying to maim and kill people?! That breaks your heart?! It does break her heart! She wishes that were the case. Because then her narrative would be true. Then her wholly beautiful narrative that America is hopelessly racist and vicious and bigoted and white people are the devil and Trump supporters are the devil… That would now be true. She wishes that were the case. Unfortunately for her, America is a pretty good country. And marginalized communities are not really oppressed. She’s so sad about that. She said, “I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know there is a deep dark racist history in Chicago. And if proved true this would have been one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fiber of my being.”

When was the last time a Republican ran the city of Chicago? I mean there are a lot of terrible problems in Chicago. A lot of guns, a lot of terrible violence, a lot of terrible governance in Chicago. All true. Not caused by Trump supporters. Not caused by white straight males, big daddy patriarch. That’s a good thing. To perverted people like this Washington Post editorial assistant, that’s a bad thing! But to normal right-thinking people, that’s a good thing.

So why did Jussie Smollett do it, if he did? In part, there is a selfish reason, in part, there’s a cultural reason. One, what is being reported now is that he was going to be written off the show, “Empire.” He didn’t want to be written off “Empire.” So he decided to try to get some headlines to make it such that he couldn’t get written off. How did he know that this would work though? If that’s true or not I don’t really care, selfish reasons or whatever. He knew that would work because our culture rewards victimhood. Victimhood carries special currency. If you can pretend to be a victim, that will help you socially.

We talk about white privilege, we talk about straight privilege, we talk about male privilege. In our culture today, those are not privileges, those are just advantages. And actually, the privileges are to be the opposite. The privileges are to be marginalized. If you are a racial minority, if you’re a woman, if you are gay, if you are confused about your sex. Those are the advantages, those are the privileges. In the hate hoax culture, privilege is the opposite of privilege. They say this all the time, they say “even if this event wasn’t true, it gets to a greater truth.” Not it doesn’t. This is like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saying, “well something might not be factually true but its morally right.”

No, it’s not. In order to be morally right, you have to be factually right. You can’t have a fantasy be reality. You can’t contradict reality and say that that is reality. That is what the Left wants us to do. But that isn’t the case. So what they do is try to make the events fit the narrative. They stage these hoaxes to show people the “deeper truth.” There’s no deeper truth, it’s a lie.

No word on whether it would be replaced by another Lyon family member's performance, or if another dialogue-centric scene would get written up instead.

In the wake of ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's alleged attack a throng of celebrities and politicians rushed to social media to embrace the actor and condemn the incident.

But, in the wake of allegations Smollett may have orchestrated the attack, many are now openly questioning his role in the incident or quietly withdrawing their support.

Chicago police are still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after questioning two brothers about the attack who were then released Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday.

Never one to hold her tongue, Cardi B addressed the Smollett case during a live stream over the weekend.

“So, I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f**k his name is. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro,” Cardi said during a live stream.

She added, “I’m not gonna say…yet, until he said out his mouth that it was fake and this s**t was staged. I don’t wanna completely blame him, because, you know, like, somebody that I was talking to, they said, like, you know, ‘Police in Chicago are racist.’ So they might probably tryna frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.”

Cardi isn't the only entertainer shifting gears on Smollett. Rapper Snoop Dogg posted a meme over the weekend that showed Smollett on the run from police.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi quietly deleted a tweet she sent out on January 29th, according to Business Insider, stating: ""The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery [and] that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once [and] for all.""

MSNBC political commentator Rev. Al Sharpton, who appeared side by side with Smollett in July for a screening of the film ""Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story"" said the actor should face severe consequences if it's proved that he orchestrated the attack.

""I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come within law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,"" Sharpton said on his show ""PoliticsNation."" ""I still maintain that and if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.""

New Jersey senator and presidential hopeful Cory Booker, who called Smollett's alleged attack ""an attempted modern-day lynching,"" told reporters over the weekend that he would no longer comment on the incident for the time being. ""I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,"" Booker told reporters, according to CNN.

But director Ava DuVernay said despite the inconsistencies she would reserve judgment because of her overall skepticism about the police."

“Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again,” the Feb. 14 editorial in the local Democrat-Reporter read. “Seems like the Klan would be welcome to raid the gated communities [in Washington]. They call them compounds now. Truly they are the ruling class.”

The piece went on to criticize D.C. politicians for “plotting to raise taxes in Alabama” and accused national Democrats of leading the United States into unnecessary wars.

The small local paper does not have a website, but images of the piece began making the rounds on Twitter this week. The story was first reported by the local Montgomery Advertiser on Monday.

In a statement to the Advertiser, publisher Goodloe Sutton confirmed that he wrote the editorial and explained more of what he meant.

“If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we’d all been better off,” he said, clarifying to the Advertiser that he was specifically talking about lynching. “We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.”

Reps for the Democrat-Reporter did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday, and efforts to reach Sutton were also unsuccessful.

The editorial prompted swift condemnation in Alabama political circles.

“For the millions of people of color who have been terrorized by white supremacy, this kind of ‘editorializing’ about lynching is not a joke – it is a threat,” Rep. Terri Sewell tweeted. “These comments are deeply offensive and inappropriate, especially in 2019. Mr. Sutton should apologize and resign.”

“OMG! What rock did this guy crawl out from under? This editorial is absolutely disgusting & he should resign -NOW! I have seen what happens when we stand by while people-especially those with influence- publish racist, hateful views,” Alabama Senator Doug Jones said in a tweet of his own. “Words matter. Actions matter. Resign now!”"

Here's the story:

During an appearance at a bookstore in Concord, N.H., a female reporter asked the senator from California if she wanted to amend a tweet from Jan. 29, in which she said Smollett was the victim of ""an attempted modern day lynching"" and called the actor ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" Harris has also used the Smollett attack to push legislation that would make lynching a federal hate crime. ""Which tweet? What tweet?"" Harris asked. As the reporter specified the tweet in question, Harris appeared to look around for a campaign staffer before responding. ""OK, so, I will say this about that case,"" she said. ""I think that the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um, concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened. ""And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,"" Harris added. ""And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.""

The share function from the video doesn't share the kind of code I need to embed here, so click on the link to see for yourself just how bad it is.

That's not getting past first base, and it kind of suggests someone who's at a minimum concealing her thoughts.

There was no follow-on question about what listeners were really interested in, which is whether she had a role in the entire hoax itself. That's the real question now, because a black Hollywood film producer who seems to be wise to her has made the argument that the attack seemed to align with the work of a Democratic Party machine where an anti-lynching legislative bill, brought on by Harris (and rival Cory Booker), was all set up to pass as the news of this now exposed hoax broke. The film producer said he was alerted to something going on with the last-minute insertion of gay language into the bill, adding anti-gay hate crime language to the law to be passed, which matched perfectly with the crime Smollett said he is a victim of.

Harris, we know, seems to be the candidate of the Democratic establishment. Like former President Obama, she has that multiracial composition that duplicates the successful Obama run, which is great for a party so focused on identity politics, and, in the #MeToo era, is helpfully a woman. She's been schooled in the art of politics by none other than Willie Brown, the sharpest political grandmaster in the Democrats' talent quiver, and she also has the continuous and sustained support of networks such as CNN as well as newspapers such as the New York Times. Her press corps, after all, helps her pick out her clothing.

Yet unlike Obama, her response to being caught out — even before she was caught out and called to answer for the matter — was one of fear. She really doesn't like that topic now and doesn't know how to answer, not even with an impressive Bill Clinton– or Obama-style lie. She's a one-term senator, and perhaps that isn't surprising.

The heat is on; it's going to get hotter; she's up until now only been surrounded by fawning leftists who agree with her, which has left her defenseless in understanding her competition; and she's not ready.

This is an early sign of a campaign that's falling apart. Look for more of these blunders. She's going to melt in the heat.

‘I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro. I’m not gonna say… yet. Until he says out his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged. I don’t wanna completely blame him.’ She said.

Background:

Jussie Smollett who is known for his role as “Jamal” in hit TV series, Empire, was reported to have suffered a homophobic attack from unknown white persons who acted as Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again supporters.

The actor self-transported himself to a hospital as he was beaten with bleach poured on him during the attack. News of the brutality the actor suffered went viral attracting sympathizers from the African-American community and anti-trump supporters.

However, in a twist from investigations, the identity of Jussie's attackers were revealed as his two Nigerian brothers with reports that he likely contracted them to stage the attack on him for a publicity stunt, a claim that his Lawyers deny but Cardi B among other celebrities are already disappointed in the twist of the investigation.

Listen:

“The issue is that this is a terrible situation that Jussie has told police had happened. The other issue is that there have been so many leaks to different media from the police that, now, none of us really know what is the full and total way that these events have gone,” Forbes contributor Adrienne Gibbs said.

The evidence strongly suggests that Smollett hired two Nigerian actors to stage a fake hate crime.

“So at this point I’m personally feeling and the people I’ve interviewed have echoed this as well, that we just need some charges to come forward, need the police to come forward, put a name to it, and to say whatever it is or whatever it isn’t,” Gibbs continued.

The Chicago Police Department has made it clear that Smollett was not a victim of any crime.

“Given that Chicago police have had kind of an interesting history with people of color, it’s just a really tough thing,” the Forbes contributor concluded, adding that she stands with Hollywood producer Ava DuVernay, who over the weekend had tweeted that the CPD shouldn’t be trusted.

Look:

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 17, 2019

DuVernay’ theory is that the CPD may be the ones lying.

Just to be clear, even the Hollywood producer’s own Twitter followers think her theory is silly.

Look:

Sister, I respect all that you do for our people and just who you are, but this case was fishy from the start. What famous person goes out in sub zero weather at 2am for subway, alone? Then, he wore the rope around his neck back to the hotel and walked past the guard at hotel. — AL Distributors (@drewskilee7) February 17, 2019

Jussie Smollett’s words are questionable. We were all shocked at this senseless act, but we must hold our own accountable too when things don’t line up. — Janell8ItAll (@LiveLoveLifeDo) February 17, 2019

Come on, Ava. Damn. Switch the narrative to he messed up and you had to believe him because if you didnt, no one would. Can’t put this on the ills of the PD, even as awful as they often are. This fish was rotten from the start. Never made sense. Never. — Richie P. (@RealRichieP) February 17, 2019

Why wouldnt he give over his phone. If I was the victim of a hate crime, I would do everything they want, if it would help the investigation.Dude is wack and mad suspect. Lock his ass up for wasting everyone’s time Someone probably died because police were too busy with this fool — mark (@markson484) February 18, 2019

Smollett claimed in late January that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931.

According to TMZ, Smollett also claimed that the suspect was white. The dubious description of the alleged attack provided to local authorities by him led the left to assume the perpetrators were racist white supporters of President Donald Trump and that Trump was therefore to blame.

It’s since been learned that the actor most likely staged the attack with the help of two Nigerian actors whom he’d hired. Local authorities haven’t reached a definite conclusion yet in part because of Smollett’s stubborn refusal to meet with them for an interview, as noted Monday by CNN host Brooke Baldwin’s other guest, Philadelphia magazine columnist Ernest Owens.

“That’s going to require Jussie to step forward, you know,” he said, responding to Gibbs’ complaint that the police need to conclude their investigation and announce their results.

“I’m a journalist and for me accountability starts with the person who’s calling out the shots. He got on ‘Good Morning America.’ He gave us this sob story and now all of a sudden he doesn’t want to cooperate with police today after an entire weekend. Where they do that at? I’m looking at it with a side eye. All this information is coming forward, and now all of a sudden he doesn’t want to cooperate with police. He redacted information and phone messages.”

Listen:

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

After Smollett first reported the incident late last month, he refused to hand over his phone records. He eventually acquiesced to the authorities’ demands but only gave them a “heavily redacted” version of his phone messages. Why would an innocent man behave like this?

An innocent man wouldn’t, which is why Owens is certain Smollett is guilty — and that instead of refusing to cooperate (or trash-talk the police, as Gibbs did), the actor needs to man-up.

“I’m just trying to figure out where is the confusion here,” he said, referencing Gibbs’ attempt to muddy the waters. “He needs to cooperate with police, come clean and fall back.”

Social media users agree:

@JussieSmollett Why don’t you want to cooperate with CPD anymore? Hired a defense team, a crisis management team. Your “attackers” have flipped on you as well. Time to give up the lie and face the consequences. You lied and got caught! — Jeff Pagell (@JPag_23) February 19, 2019

Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett posted a quote attributed to Malcolm X on Instagram.

“This is the media, the irresponsible media,” the posting said. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”

Jussie Smollett’s career awaits outcome of his case

Smollett-Bell, who starred in the TV series “Underground” and voiced the character of Chrysta in “Sofia the First,” reposted the image from her brother Jocqui, who also posted an image of a tweet in support of Jussie Smollett.

“I have a feeling even if we had video of Jussie (Smollett) being attacked…y’all would still discredit him,” the tweet read. “Because it’s easier to believe what aligns with your contempt for survivors of hate crimes, sexual abuse, etc who happen to be LGBTQ+, disabled, or women.”

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN that Chicago police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the alleged assault.

Police sources: New evidence suggests Jussie Smollett orchestrated attack

In a statement from his attorneys issued Saturday, Smollett denied playing a role in the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The “Empire” star told authorities two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs” assaulted him January 29. He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Jussie Smollett case: Everything we know so far

His family offered early support to Smollett, releasing a statement standing with the actor and thanking everyone for their help after what they called an act of “domestic terrorism.”

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning,” the statement said. “His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice. “

There are six Smollett siblings.

Brother Jake Smollett is a culinary expert. The family has starred on the Food Network’s ‘Smollett Eats” and co-authored a cookbook."

There have been no arrests made or charges filed, even though District Attorney Jackie Lacey is a Black woman. Now Buck has been spotted with another Black man.

CBS LA caught Buck with a Black man who appeared to be in his 20s. Buck was grilled by the reporter who asked, “Do you think your political influence is keeping you a free man?” See below:

On Jan. 7, 55-year-old Timothy Dean who allegedly worked at Saks Fifth Avenue, died at Buck’s home. See his photo below:

In a new report from The Daily Beast, Dean reportedly warned other people to say away from Buck. He claimed the 64-year-old had a fetish for men wearing white long johns and once said, “Don’t go in that house because you might never come back.” When the first Black man was found dead in Buck’s home, he allegedly said he was the “devil” and “This might be it for Ed Buck.”

It’s not clear why Dean went to Buck’s home the night he died.

Black Lives Matters in Los Angeles have asked District Attorney Jackie Lacey to press charges, but nothing has happened. In addition, Lacey never filed charges against Buck even after 26-year-old Gemmel Moore died in his home in July 2017.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Moore wrote in a journal a few months before he died that he was using drugs and “Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of chrystal [sic] meth.”

On July 4, 23 days before Moore died, an escort reported Buck to authorities for drugging Black men, but nothing was done. After Moore died, Buck’s apartment was searched. Law enforcement allegedly “found the following items in Buck’s two-bedroom apartment: 24 syringes with brown residue, five glass pipes with white residue and burn marks, a plastic straw with possible white residue, clear plastic bags with white powdery residue and a clear plastic bag with a ‘piece of crystal-like substance.'”

According to The Advocate, Buck has a “fetish for shooting drugs into black men he picks up off the street or on hookup site.” The L.A. County Coroner’s office said Moore’s death was due to an overdose of methamphetamine.

Clearly, Buck’s money and privilege have allowed him to avoid jail time, which is completely about race.

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men in January who recognized him from his Fox show ""Empire,"" in the middle of the night in an affluent Chicago neighborhood with temperatures around zero degrees. He said they beat him up, yelled racist and homophobic slurs, put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and then ran off. He also said they yelled ""This is MAGA country"" at him, to indicate the assailants were supporters of President Donald Trump.

Now, investigators have reason to believe Smollett orchestrated the attack himself and the entire thing was an elaborate hoax, although the entertainer maintains he is a victim.

Yet at the time of the incident, newscasts played up the ""brutal"" attack and some news chyrons blindly accepted Smollett's turn of events, such as one from MSNBC that read ""Breaking News: ‘Empire' Star Jussie Smollett attacked in Chicago by men hurling racist and homophobic slurs."" MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle mourned the ""horrible"" assault, while CNN's Brooke Baldwin intoned, ""This is America in 2019,"" adding the details were ""absolutely despicable.""

E! News personalities reacted in horror at the ""stomach-churning"" details of the attack, and one ""Entertainment Tonight"" reporter said at the conclusion of one of his segments that his ""prayers were with Jussie.""

ABC News host Robin Roberts interviewed Smollett last week for ""Good Morning America"" and asked such softball questions that one CNN analyst said later it ""was a celebrity interview more than a news person interview.""

""It's been two weeks since that night left actor Jussie Smollett bruised but not broken, and he's still processing the raw emotions,"" Roberts said over footage of Smollett wiping away tears with a tissue.

Smollett reiterated during the interview that the nature of his attack was political, saying it was because he comes ""really hard at 45,"" a reference to Trump being the 45th president. He cried several times and said he couldn't bear the idea his attackers wouldn't be brought to justice.

Chicago Police now believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault, according to law enforcement sources who spoke to CNN.

The initial media reaction was worse on Twitter. Mediaite compiled dozens of media members who repeated Smollett's account and often tied it to the culture of Trump's politics.

In contrast, local Chicago reporters have dug into the story since it began. Cracks were subsequently exposed in Smollett's story, and the police turned their investigation around.

The initial reaction was even more stark in the 2020 White House race, with Democratic presidential candidates and other progressive politicians immediately tweeting out their horror and condemnation of the purported attack. Trump also called the attack terrible when asked about it at the White House.

Only now are some hopefuls like Sens. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) and Cory Booker (D., N.J.) saying they want to wait for all the facts before commenting further.

If only the national press were this incredulous in the first place."

Jussie Smollett is already feeling some backlash in the wake of new allegations that he may have staged his own attack.

And for the Empire star, the pushback is coming from where it hurts the most: his very own TV show.

According to TMZ, producers have significantly cut down his screen time in the second to last episode — filming this week — as the actor was supposed to be in nine scenes, as well as a big musical number.

However, per production sources, FIVE of his scenes have been completely cut out, and his musical number is no more. Plus, in the other four scenes, he’s now no longer the feature player — instead, in various ways, he’s flanked by other cast members rather than being the focal point, as he’d originally been.

Writers have reportedly been spending the last 24 hours making major edits to the script to accommodate production wishes and pull Jussie back in a bit. Because of all this, he’ll reportedly only be on set for two days — at most — this week: Thursday and Friday.

Not great!

“GMA” anchor Robin Roberts interviewed Smollett on February 14, in which the “Empire” star gave his account of the attack.

It has since been reported via unnamed sources that Smollett may have colluded with Ola and Abel Osundairo, two brothers who were arrested and then released last week, to stage the attack.

Facing criticism over her interview with Smollett, Roberts addressed the issue on the air on Monday.

“When I sat down with Jussie it was Tuesday night [February 12] in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened,” Roberts said, according to Just Jared. “At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being co-operative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

Transcript via Fox News:

“Which tweet? What tweet?” Harris asked. As the reporter specified the tweet in question, Harris appeared to look around for a campaign staffer before responding. “OK, so, I will say this about that case,” she said. “I think that the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um, concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened. “And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,” Harris added. “And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

That’s just … embarrassing.

Either Harris isn’t running her own social media accounts or she’s dodging by pretending she didn’t rush to judgment as Booker and so many others did when news of the alleged attack first broke.

In any event, it’s just not a good look at all for the perceived frontrunner. Then again, when you’re used to journalists turning into fashion consultants for you, you’re probably not expecting any tough questions…

THE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders share one common challenge as they both run for president again in 2020. Hillary Clinton won’t be on the ballot.

The president still routinely uses his 2016 opponent as a foil to rally his base — 27 months after he defeated her in the electoral college. Trump supporters still chant “Lock her up” during his rallies, as they did in Texas last week.

The Vermont senator, who formally announced this morning that he will again seek the Democratic nomination for president, also benefited from Clinton fatigue last time that he cannot count on again. She was perceived as so formidable that potential rivals like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren passed on challenging her. That left Bernie as the alternative. Many of his supporters in 2016 didn’t identify as democratic socialists, but they did think Clinton was too supportive of free trade, too hawkish and too dynastic.

Sanders — who received more than 13 million votes in 2016 — enters an already crowded, and still growing, field with one of the best email lists in politics, a proven ability to raise lots of money from small-dollar donors, a huge social media following and very high name recognition. The party he seeks to lead is also lurching leftward and moving his direction on a battery of issues.

He is determined to prove that he’s more than a protest candidate or a modern-day Moses guiding liberals through the wilderness. Yet most Democratic strategists, analysts and insiders see Bernie’s quest as quixotic. As Bernie tries again, here are 10 challenges facing the political revolution:

Bernie Sanders watches Trump deliver the State of the Union on Feb. 5. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

1. Beware the ghost of Rick Santorum.

Politicians across the ideological spectrum often have unrealistic views of the loyalty they command at the grass-roots level. History shows that caucus-goers and primary voters in the early states are fickle and cruel mistresses. The former Pennsylvania senator won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 with 30,000 votes. When he ran again four years later, Santorum spent just as much time camped out in the Hawkeye State but amassed only 1,783 votes — less than one percentage point. Mike Huckabee, who won the caucuses in 2008, got less than 2 percent of the vote. Santorum and Huckabee believed they could count on their old supporters coming home. They counted wrong.

2. He’ll suffer from the burden of high expectations.

Clinton narrowly won the Iowa caucuses four years ago; it was essentially a tie. But Bernie beat her by 22 points in the New Hampshire primary a week later. This doesn’t mean he’s got a lock on the Granite State in 2020. Far from it. But it does mean that Sanders’s 2020 apparatus, fundraising and more will be constantly compared to their 2016 equivalents.

Bernie is legendary for drawing huge crowds. If he cannot turn out big numbers for his events, this will be covered as evidence of diminished enthusiasm — even if the events are larger than at this point in the cycle four years before. “In early polls of Iowa and New Hampshire, where he won 50 percent and 60 percent of the vote, support for the senator from Vermont has ranged from the low teens to 30 percent,” Dave Weigel notes.

3. The old band isn’t getting back together.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign in 2016, and she still has nice things to say about him, but the liberal phenom made clear that she will stay on the sidelines of the 2020 campaign. The 29-year-old suggested earlier this month that she might wait to back a horse until the eve of the New York primary, when she could play the role of kingmaker.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was one of Bernie’s biggest surrogates in 2016. Now she’s running for president herself. Author Marianne Williamson also supported Sanders, but she’s running too. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the only senator to endorse Sanders last time, continues to explore his own bid for the nomination.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a longtime friend, didn’t endorse Sanders last time. But she’s cutting into his coalition now. She also poached Brendan Summers, the Iowa caucuses director for Sanders in 2016.

4. He’s a victim of his own success.

Sanders correctly points out that most Democratic candidates have embraced or copied his positions on Medicare-for-all, a $15 minimum wage and debt-free college that Clinton surrogates portrayed as extreme last time. “All of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans,” Bernie wrote in a 1,500-word email to supporters this morning. “Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.” The challenge is that Sanders does not have this turf to himself anymore, and just because he was first, doesn’t mean people who want Medicare-for-all will necessarily back him.

5. He’ll face more scrutiny.

Clinton herself was afraid to attack Sanders too hard, lest she alienate his supporters and push them toward Green Party nominee Jill Stein — or even Trump, who was also decrying trade deals and promising to do something about income inequality as a candidate.

Because reporters didn’t believe Sanders could actually win the nomination, and saw him mainly as a foil against Clinton, they didn’t dive as deeply into his record early on as they would have with more conventional candidates. This allowed Sanders to introduce himself to voters on his own terms.

The recent #MeToo reckoning has offered a taste of the extra scrutiny Sanders will face this time that he didn’t last time. The senator publicly apologized last month to female staffers of his 2016 campaign who say they were sexually harassed by co-workers. His apology came after news reports that Sanders’s former Iowa campaign manager had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees. Sanders said he was unaware of the $30,000 payout.

6. He enters the race with high negatives, limiting his upside potential.

Sanders endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention and campaigned for her in the fall, but many from the party establishment nonetheless blamed him for their defeat. “His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump’s ‘Crooked Hillary’ campaign,” Clinton complained in her 2017 campaign memoir.

Another factor that still annoys many Democrats: He is not a registered Democrat. Sanders caucuses with them in the Senate, but he’s steadfastly refused to register as a member of the party he seeks to lead. (He and I discussed his reasoning last June.)

7. He’s four years older.

Sanders has impressive stamina, but he is 77. That would make him the oldest nominee ever for a major party, breaking the record set by Trump. He’d turn 80 during his first year in office. The opposition party very often gravitates toward someone who is the opposite of the president in power. There seems to be hunger at the activist level for fresh faces, plus women and candidates of color. History suggests that Democrats will gravitate toward someone who is younger, the way they put Barack Obama up against John McCain in 2008, Bill Clinton against George H.W. Bush in 1992 and Jimmy Carter against Gerald Ford in 1976.

8. Democrats badly want to defeat Trump, and Sanders will face lingering questions about electability.

“A Monmouth University poll found that 56 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents wanted a candidate who will perform well against Trump, even if they disagree with that person on most issues,” Clare Malone notes on FiveThirtyEight. “What electability actually means in this context is quite vague, but if it becomes a proxy for a centrist candidate palatable to swing voters, Sanders might be out of luck. Or, even if voters decide that ‘electable’ means more left, Sanders could lose out to new faces trying to sell their pragmatic progressivism … We might be wise not to discount voters’ affinity for these new, shiny candidates: 59 percent of respondents in a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll said they would be interested in ‘someone entirely new’ as their nominee. Forty-one percent of those polled said Sanders shouldn’t even run again.”

9. He will again take heat for past apostasies on immigration and guns.

Sanders played a key role in killing a comprehensive immigration overhaul during George W. Bush’s second term because he took the side of labor unions over Latinos, something that their allies on Capitol Hill have never forgotten. The politics have changed, as have the unions, and Sanders has now staked out a position that’s in line with the rest of the party.

Gun control is another area where Sanders has worked to catch up with the zeitgeist in Democratic politics. He represents a rural state that, while liberal, has a significant gun culture. In fact, Sanders was once endorsed by the NRA. Now he brags about his bad rating.

Clinton scored points on guns and immigration in 2016, but both these issues have taken on even more outsize importance to Democratic primary voters in the ensuing years. In fact, they’ve become litmus tests.

10. He’s got his work cut out for him with African Americans.

Sanders stumbled in 2016 when he got demolished in South Carolina because he failed to make inroads with black voters, which cost him several other states in the South. African American women emerged as Clinton’s firewall in the series of primaries on March 1, 2016.

A story on the front page of Monday’s New York Times looked at why Sanders struggled to prioritize and execute a winning plan to build support in the black community. “Top aides lost faith in their African-American outreach organizers, whose leadership was replaced and whose team members were scattered across the country. Initiatives like a tour of historically black colleges and universities fizzled; Mr. Sanders even missed its kickoff event,” Sydney Ember reported. “And his campaign’s experience in 2016, as described in interviews with nearly two dozen current and former advisers and staff members, reveals a strikingly uneven commitment on the part of Mr. Sanders and his top advisers to organize and communicate effectively with black voters and leaders.”

The senator has stepped up outreach and takes the problem seriously, but this time at least two of his opponents will be African American: fellow senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

MORE ON 2020:

-- Barack Obama does not plan to endorse any of the Democratic presidential candidates, but he has been offering advice to several contenders. The New York Times’s Alex Burns reports: “Mr. Obama has told friends and likely presidential candidates in private … that he does not see it as his role to settle the 2020 nomination, and prefers to let the primary unfold as a contest of ideas. [Michelle Obama] also has no plans to endorse a candidate, a person familiar with her thinking said. Even former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. does not expect to secure Mr. Obama’s backing if he runs … [Obama] has counseled more than a dozen declared or likely candidates on what he believes it will take to beat [Trump], holding private talks with leading contenders like [Kamala] Harris, [Cory] Booker and [Elizabeth] Warren; underdogs like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and prominent figures who remain undecided on the race, like Eric H. Holder, his former attorney general, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.”

-- The new “virtual” caucus option being offered to Iowa Democrats in 2020 could expand the electorate by almost a third. The Des Moines Register’s Brianne Pfannenstiel reports: “The results show that 21 percent of Iowans say they will definitely or probably participate in the 2020 Democratic caucuses. Eight percent initially said they were unlikely to caucus for Democrats in person, but also say they would definitely or probably participate if they had the option to do so remotely. All told, the results suggest 29 percent of Iowa adults expect to participate in the Democratic caucuses in 2020.”

-- Amy Klobuchar portrayed herself as the most pragmatic Democrat in the field during a CNN town hall in New Hampshire last night. The Minnesota senator called progressive platforms “aspirational,” said that Medicare-for-all is “something we can look to in the future"" and added she is ""not for [free] four-year college at all."" From Politico's Elena Schneider: Klobuchar “is pitching herself as pragmatic Midwesterner who won’t over-promise liberal policies to primary voters. The three-term senator carefully calibrated her answers on several progressive platforms — expressing support without fully committing to them. But her tell-it-like-it-is centrism could prove problematic for a Democratic primary electorate that has drawn further to the left. … On climate change, Klobuchar said she believes that ‘we can get close’ to the Green New Deal, but that she doesn’t ‘think we’re going to get rid of entire industries in the U.S.'”

-- Kamala Harris is under fire for her rush to judgment after “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett claimed he was attacked. The California Democrat quickly tweeted the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” But now that Chicago police reportedly believe the attack may have been staged, the senator said she won’t comment until an investigation is completed. Harris said “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and that it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation,"" per the Associated Press.

The Chicago Police Department, meanwhile, would not confirm or deny press reports that authorities are investigating whether Smollett staged the attack. The two brothers who were questioned about the attack were released without charges. According to the local CBS affiliate in Chicago, Smollett may have decided to stage the attack because he was frustrated that a racist letter to the “Empire” studio didn’t get a “bigger reaction.”

-- Elizabeth Warren will unveil an initiative designed to provide every family with affordable, high-quality child care. From the HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn: “The plan seeks to make access to child care universal … No family would have to spend more than 7 percent of its household income on child care, no matter the number of kids. Families with incomes below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 a year for a family of four, would pay nothing. … The campaign has an internal analysis that shows the initiative will likely require approximately $700 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. … If that estimate is indicative, the new outlays in Warren’s plan would be at least four times what the federal government currently spends on its main early childhood programs.”

-- Beto O’Rourke’s voting record on a border wall could become a vulnerability if he enters the presidential field. The AP’s Will Weissert reports: “In March, he supported a spending package that other leading Democratic contenders opposed and included $1.6 billion for border wall construction in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and elsewhere. Buried in that was $445 million for repairs of existing fencing elsewhere — including [El Paso, which O'Rourke represented in Congress]. … O’Rourke’s nuanced position on border barriers, sometimes willing to use them as a bargaining chip, could be politically awkward in a national campaign but it’s shared in El Paso. Here, many people accept dozens of miles of existing walls as a fact of life, objecting mostly to structures so intrusive they suggest a war zone.”

-- Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has given away $6.4 billion to numerous charities fighting, among other issues, climate change, gun violence and obesity. He may soon find out whether his financial backing will translate into support for a presidential campaign. (Politico)

-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan remains popular three months after being reelected to a second term, but a majority of Marylanders don’t want the Republican to challenge Trump in a primary. Arelis Hernández reports on a new Goucher College poll: “Large majorities of Marylanders find the governor likable (85 percent) and ‘honest and trustworthy’ (70 percent) and applaud his management of the state government (80 percent) … Two-thirds of residents say they disapprove of Trump’s performance in the White House, while 30 percent approve. Still, more than half of Marylanders — 55 percent — say Hogan should not run for president.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- A coalition of 16 states led by California filed a federal lawsuit aimed at blocking Trump’s plan to build a border wall by declaring a national emergency. Amy Goldstein reports: “The lawsuit, brought by states with Democratic governors — except one, Maryland — seeks a preliminary injunction that would prevent the president from acting on his emergency declaration while the case plays out in the courts. … Several nonprofit organizations already have gone to court or announced plans to sue. And protesters took to the streets in several cities Monday. Across from the White House, demonstrators held neon-colored letters that spelled ‘Power grab.’

“The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, a San Francisco-based court whose judges have ruled against an array of other Trump administration policies. … Judges there, for example, have ruled against efforts by the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, numerous rollbacks of environmental regulations, efforts to curtail asylum for migrants and the Department of Homeland Security’s revocation of special ‘temporary protected status’ for hundreds of thousands of immigrants legally living in the United States. Cases appealed from that court go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which has become a whipping post for Trump.”

The 56-page lawsuit says diverting money that Congress designated for other purposes violates the separation of powers defined in the Constitution: “Another clause of the Constitution, the lawsuit notes, prevents money from being paid from the U.S. Treasury unless Congress has appropriated it. The lawsuit also says that the ‘federal government’s own data prove there is no national emergency at the southern border that warrants construction of a wall. Customs and Border Protection data show that unlawful entries are near 45-year lows.’ And it enumerates ways that residents of the participating states — and the states themselves — could be harmed by the diversion of money. They include loss of funding to military bases, weakened drug-fighting efforts and damage to states’ economies.”

The other states besides California that joined the suit are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Virginia. Maryland is the only party to the suit with a GOP governor, but the complaint was signed by Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat.

-- More than 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency over the border wall, according to a poll by NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist. “Nearly 6-in-10 also don't believe there is an emergency at the southern border and that the president is misusing his presidential authority. They also believe that his decision should be challenged in court. ‘All things related to the declaring of a national emergency, the president is striking out in the court of public opinion,’ said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. ‘He's maintaining his base and little else.’”

-- A Mexican man detained by Customs and Border Protection died at a medical facility in McAllen, Tex., after seeking medical attention twice. His death is likely to raise more questions about the way the border agency is organized and funded as the White House continues demanding money for a border wall. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The detainee requested medical attention, and was transported to a hospital in Mission, Tex., adjacent to McAllen. The same day, the individual was cleared to travel and sent back to a CBP station in Rio Grande City, close to Roma. On Feb. 3, the detainee again requested medical attention, and, according to CBP, was transported to the McAllen Medical Center ‘shortly thereafter.’ The Mexican national was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure and remained at the 441-bed hospital from Feb. 3 until dying just before 9 a.m. Monday.”

-- In West Virginia, teachers and school workers who inspired a national movement against low pay are standing up once again to protest the investment of state funds into private school vouchers and charter schools. Moriah Balingit reports: “West Virginia teachers say they are frustrated by a proposal to create education savings account, a kind of private school voucher in which the state deposits money in a special account for eligible recipients to pay for private school. The bill would have also allowed for charter schools to establish in the state. The State Senate wrote the proposals into a funding bill that included raises for teachers and more funding for rural schools. West Virginia’s House of Delegates voted to strip both proposals from the bill.”

Did you tell the “Gang of Eight” that you had opened a counterintelligence investigation into President Trump? @savannahguthrie asks Andrew McCabe pic.twitter.com/w4cKwAvvF9 — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 19, 2019

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe said Tuesday that officials briefed a bipartisan group of lawmakers after the bureau opened an investigation into Trump in May 2017, and that no one in the room pushed back. “That’s the important part here,” McCabe said in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show. “No one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds and not based on the facts.”

“The briefing, McCabe said, was with the Gang of Eight — a bipartisan group of lawmakers comprising the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate, as well as the leaders from both parties of the House and Senate intelligence committees,” Matt Zapotosky reports. “McCabe — who is in the middle of a media tour promoting his new book, ‘The Threat’ — told [Savannah] Guthrie the FBI felt it had good reason to investigate Trump in May 2017 after he fired James B. Comey as the bureau’s director. He said the bureau thought it was ‘possible’ that Trump was working on behalf of Russia, and opening a case signified that the FBI was treating the matter as a national security threat. ‘It is saying that we had information that led us to believe that there might be a threat to national security — in this case that the president himself might, in fact, be a threat to the United States’ national security,’ McCabe said.

“The comments seemed designed to rebut criticism that McCabe has faced from Trump and other Republicans in recent days for initiating the investigation into Trump and participating in conversations about other, more dramatic steps against the president,” Zapotosky notes. “McCabe told CBS’s ‘60 Minutes’ over the weekend that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein talked with him about wearing a wire to surreptitiously record the president, or using the 25th Amendment to oust him — prompting a strong, negative reaction from Trump and his GOP allies. Rosenstein has vaguely disputed McCabe’s description of those conversations. ‘Treason!’ Trump wrote Monday night on Twitter, after apparently quoting from a segment on Sean Hannity’s television show about McCabe.""

-- Rosenstein is planning on leaving the Justice Department next month. Zapotosky reports: “Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official … made it known in recent weeks that he planned to leave if and when a new attorney general was confirmed by the Senate. … People familiar with the matter said the administration also has decided to nominate Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy secretary of transportation, to take over [Rosenstein’s] job. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate, which probably would occur after Rosenstein leaves.”

-- “Days after a federal judge imposed a limited gag order on him, Roger Stone posted a photograph of that judge to his Instagram page that included her name, a close-up of her face and what appeared to be the crosshairs of a gun sight near her head. Stone, a longtime [Trump] confidant, deleted the picture soon afterward, then reposted it without the crosshairs before deleting that second post as well,” Reis Thebault and Manuel Roig-Franzia report. “In the text accompanying the first post, Stone referred to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who brought the case against him. ‘Through legal trickery Deep State hitman Robert Mueller has guaranteed that my upcoming show trial is before Judge Amy Berman Jackson,’ Stone wrote, adding that Jackson is ‘an Obama appointed judge’ and the ‘#fixisin.’ … In a text message to The Washington Post on Monday, Stone said the photograph of Jackson had been posted by a ‘volunteer’ who helps him with his social media accounts. ‘The photo has been misinterpreted and in no way did I mean to threaten the judge or disrespect the court,' Stone wrote.”

“ Jackson imposed the gag order Friday , telling Stone that he could not make statements to the media about his case near the federal courthouse in Washington, but imposing no other restrictions on his ability to make public comments.”

, telling Stone that he could not make statements to the media about his case near the federal courthouse in Washington, but imposing no other restrictions on his ability to make public comments.” “In a Monday court filing, Stone’s lawyers formally apologized for the post. ‘Undersigned counsel, with the attached authority of Roger J. Stone, hereby apologizes to the Court for the improper photograph and comment posted on Instagram today,’ the filing reads. ‘Mr. Stone recognizes the impropriety and had it removed.’”

-- House Democrats are launching a new investigation into the alleged ties between the NRA and senior Russians with connections to the Kremlin. ABC News’s Pete Madden and Matthew Mosk report: “In a letter sent to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre … Rep. Ted Lieu of California and Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York expressed concern about the NRA’s attempts to distance itself from any formal involvement in a now infamous trip to Moscow undertaken by a group of its high-ranking members. … [Lieu and Rice] … requested a full accounting of any communications, meetings and monetary transactions between NRA officials and Russia-linked individuals.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- China has been capitalizing on the United States pulling back from Afghanistan to expand its power in central Asia. Gerry Shih reports from Shaymak, Tajikistan: “Two miles above sea level in the inhospitable highlands of Central Asia, there’s a new power watching over an old passage into Afghanistan: China. For at least three years, Chinese troops have quietly monitored this choke point in Tajikistan just beyond China’s western frontier, according to interviews, analysis of satellite images and photographs, and firsthand observations by a Washington Post journalist. While veiled in secrecy, the outpost of about two dozen buildings and lookout towers illustrates how the footprint of Chinese hard power has been expanding alongside the country’s swelling economic reach.”

“The modest facility in Tajikistan — which offers a springboard into Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor a few miles away — has not been publicly acknowledged by any government. At a moment when the United States might consider a pact that would pull American troops out of Afghanistan, China appears to be tiptoeing into a volatile region critical to its security and its continental ambitions.”

-- A few months after the U.S. arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s CFO, the company’s founder (and Wanzhou’s father) said that the U.S. can’t crush the company and that the world can’t leave it. (BBC)

-- A top official in the U.S. Chamber of Congress said the U.S. can’t count on pledges from China to buy more American goods if the White House doesn’t first set up ways to enforce the trade agreement with the nation. (CNBC)

-- Trump warned that Venezuelan military officials who do not abandon President Nicolás Maduro in favor of the U.S.-backed opposition will “lose everything.” Toluse Olorunnipa and Anne Gearan report: “The president spoke to a crowd in Miami that included Venezuelan expatriates who fled the country’s socialist policies and soaring inflation. … Trump, who in 2017 said that he was considering a ‘military option’ for Venezuela, warned military leaders not to threaten violence against peaceful protesters. He came as close as he has thus far to threatening to use U.S. force against the Maduro regime. … In a televised event Monday, Maduro called Trump’s speech a ‘Nazi’ discourse.”

-- Some Democrats criticized Trump for doing too little to help exiled Venezuelans inside the United States. From the Miami Herald's David Smiley and Martin Vassolo: “Democratic members of Florida’s congressional delegation again called on Trump to extend Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans, and accused Trump of 'using the suffering of Venezuelans to score points.' ... Rep. Donna Shalala, who has filed a bill to extend TPS for Venezuelans, said deportations of Venezuelans increased from 182 in 2006 to 248 in 2017, and that there’s a backlog of 70,000 petitions for asylum from Venezuelan exiles that has accumulated over the last three years. Currently, 150,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. would qualify to stay in the country legally should Trump choose to extend TPS by executive order. 'He simply shouldn’t come to South Florida this afternoon without extending TPS and ending deportations,' Shalala said.”

-- Trump may gain some Florida voters through his attacks on Maduro during a rally in Miami, worrying some Democrats. The New York Times’s Annie Karni and Patricia Mazzei report: “In South Florida, home to the largest population of Venezuelans in the country, his remarks were ... seen as a bid to win over what may be a critical bloc of voters in the 2020 presidential race. … ‘I’m concerned about the Trump administration politicizing this issue, using Venezuelans’ suffering to score political points here in Florida,’ said Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Democrat of Miami. ‘We shouldn’t be using this as a political weapon.’ …

“The most emotional moment of the speech Monday came when Mr. Trump invited to the stage the mother of a rebel police officer who was killed by government forces in Venezuela last year. ‘I apologize if I start crying,’ Aminta Pérez said in Spanish as she took the microphone … A president often associated with a wall on the Southern border seemed happy to welcome the Spanish speaker standing next to him.”

-- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would not confirm local media reports that he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Simon Denyer and Akiko Kashiwagi report: “Trump said Friday that Abe had personally given him ‘the most beautiful copy’ of a five-page nomination letter recommending him for the prize for opening talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and lowering tensions. But Abe wouldn’t confirm that Monday. … Japanese media reports on Sunday suggested that Trump was telling the truth. The Nikkei newspaper, citing government sources, said Abe had indeed sent in a nomination. ‘He showed a five page-long copy of a letter of recommendation for the Nobel Peace Prize to President Trump at the past summit meeting,’ it quoted a source as saying.”

-- Trump is considering four people, including former deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, to be U.N. ambassador after Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination late Saturday night. “Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump’s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges,” Bloomberg News’s Jennifer Jacobs reports. Nauert “withdrew her nomination to replace former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn’t authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.” Trump is also considering two current ambassadors — Kelly Craft in Canada and Richard Grenell in Germany — as well as former Senate candidate John James.

-- People living in the last village held under Islamic State control said escaping felt like walking “out of hell.” Louisa Loveluck reports: “Wives and children of the Islamic State fighters looked confused and exhausted. Yazidi women and their families, who had been enslaved by the militants, were in shock. … The militant group’s most die-hard fighters have seen escape as a betrayal. But as the final battle loomed, others chose survival, laying down their guns and skulking out among fleeing civilians, or using middlemen to negotiate surrender. … As the end approached, refugees from Baghouz and SDF fighters said, the caliphate’s smugglers were making vast sums. Rumors swirled that several thousand dollars would get a man to Iraq or into Syrian government territory. Families paid hundreds per person to get safe passage from the snipers and out along the path to surrender.”

-- European leaders hit back at Trump’s demand that they bring home citizens who left the E.U. to join, and in some cases fight with, the Islamic State. Michael Birnbaum reports: “Many European nations have been content to leave citizens who may sympathize with the Islamic State in Syria … Trump over the weekend threatened E.U. allies on Twitter that if they did not repatriate their citizens, the United States would simply let them go … ‘There is a problem. We are aware of that in Europe,’ Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. ‘If we want to find a reasonable solution, then we have to discuss this, not send tweets back and forth.’”

-- Seven British lawmakers quit the Labour Party over its handling of Brexit and allegations of anti-Semitism. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The seven said that they would sit in Parliament as an independent group. Their defection creates new opportunities and complications for the upcoming votes on how Britain leaves the European Union next month —if it leaves at all.”

-- Using taxpayer funds, the Hungarian government has launched a campaign against European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Hungarian-born businessman George Soros. The campaign alleges that Brussels, Juncker and Soros are threatening Hungary’s security by incentivizing migration. (Politico)

-- Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is cracking down on LGBT rights in ways that have alarmed the country’s liberals. Anthony Faiola and Marina Lopes report: “Under Bolsonaro, the new Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights declined to add the LGBT community as a group explicitly protected by its mandate. Last month, the health official who headed the nation’s HIV-prevention task force was fired, apparently for authorizing a campaign aimed at educating transgender Brazilians. … In recent years, killings of LGBT Brazilians have soared, a trend activists say is getting worse as homophobic rhetoric finds an official perch.”

-- Justin Trudeau’s top political adviser resigned, widening the Canadian prime minister’s political crisis. The New York Times’s Ian Austen reports: “Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company. Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place. … Mr. Butts’s absence will leave a significant void in Mr. Trudeau’s leadership and campaign team just eight months before an election.”

-- The U.S. might open a liaison office in North Korea, a move that would further normalize relations between the two countries. The Wall Street Journal’s Michael Gordon reports: “The Trump administration official said that the liaison office idea, which appears to be just one element of a package of negotiating proposals, might be discussed further when Mr. Biegun meets in Hanoi with his North Korean counterpart prior to the summit. … Robert Einhorn, a former senior State Department official who negotiated with North Korea over its missile programs, said a liaison offices ‘would be valuable for both sides, but I am not sure whether the North Koreans are more receptive to the idea than they were in the past.’”

And “Sesame Street” reminded us of a presidential campaign of yore.

Happy #PresidentsDay! Here's a look at our favorite candidate back in 1976! 💛 pic.twitter.com/um2jlXYRkX — Sesame Street (@sesamestreet) February 18, 2019

GOOD READS:

-- AP, “DC’s many prankster activists turn anger into street theater,” by Ashraf Khalil: “There’s an ethos of performative prankster-style protest wired into the District of Columbia’s history, dating back decades. This confrontational street-theater school is flourishing with the Trump administration as its nemesis. Each month brings new acts of political theater — some confrontational, some deliberately absurdist. … For about a month last fall, a Robert Mueller investigation-themed ice cream truck roamed Washington, passing out free scoops with names like IndictMint Chip and Rocky Rod Rosenstein.”

-- The Atlantic, “What Presidential Announcements Reveal About the Candidates,” by John Dickerson: “The presidential announcement is a rare act of campaigning over which the candidates have near-total control. They pick the timing, venue, and message. Only the weather is left to chance, and the good candidates shape that too. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower spoke in the rain at his boyhood home of Abilene, Kansas. He joked about the rain in the English Channel, a casual way to remind anyone who needed it that he had led the successful D-Day invasion there. A look at the announcements of the past 70 years shows that one change is obvious: Presidential hopefuls used to declare their candidacy in a single speech; now the process is drawn out with peekaboo hints, social-media announcements that lead to explorations, and talk-show teases. It’s like an Advent calendar, but no one gets a square of chocolate.”

-- BuzzFeed News, ""20 Years After Hugo Chávez Launched The Revolution, Venezuela Is Falling Apart From Within,” by Karla Zabludovsky: “Romer Sánchez used to be a staunch supporter of Chávez’s revolution, working at a government-owned company and serving as a policeman. But last month he packed his bags and started looking at flights to Spain, where he wanted to request political asylum, joining an exodus of several million people who’ve left the country since 2014. That all changed when Guaidó took center stage. ... Sánchez lives in La Guaira, a port city to the north of Caracas that until January had not risen up against Maduro. For two decades, neighborhoods like this Chavista stronghold defined themselves by their anti-American sentiment — they sang the songs of the regime, and protested against any provocation from the US. But now the idea of a US invasion, though still frightening to many, has become somewhat more palatable to those who want to see Maduro out. 'I’ll invite the gringos to come. I’ll make them coffee myself. What we need is a radical change,' said Sánchez.”

-- “In 1969, someone sent Robert Fink a telegram. It was finally delivered last month,” by John Kelly: “It is my belief that Robert Fink is the recipient of the very last Western Union telegram ever delivered. … Notice that I said the very last telegram ‘delivered,’ not ‘sent.’ Fink received it on Jan. 2, but it was sent nearly 50 years earlier. Fink’s telegram read: ‘Sorry we cannot be there to applaud when you get your diploma but our hearts and best wishes are with you. Love Dr. and Mrs. Fischman.’ The telegram congratulated Fink on his graduation from the University of Michigan. It was sent on May 2, 1969.”

HOT ON THE LEFT: “Florida sixth-grader arrested after dispute with teacher over Pledge of Allegiance,” from Kristine Phillips : “A Florida student is facing misdemeanor charges after a confrontation with his teacher that began with his refusal to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and escalated into what officials described as disruptive behavior. The student, a sixth-grader at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland, Fla., east of Tampa, refused to stand for the pledge in the Feb. 4 incident, telling the teacher that he thinks the flag and the national anthem are ‘racist’ against black people, according to an affidavit.” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “Man accused of pulling gun on victim wearing MAGA hat,” from ABC affiliate WBKO : “A Tennessee man is in jail after being accused of pulling a gun on a Sam's Club customer Saturday. According to the police report, officers were called to Sam's Club due to a person with a gun. According to the alleged victim Terry Pierce, a man pulled a gun on him because he was wearing a Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat. … The police report confirms that the suspect, identified as James Phillips, admitted to flipping off Pierce and Pierce's wife because of their hats.”

DAYBOOK:

Trump will meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen before having lunch with Pence.

The president will also sign a directive today that will formally establish Space Policy Directive 4, a branch of the Air Force dedicated to space exploration that, against former expectations, won’t be a fully independent department.

Barack Obama is holding a town hall with NBA player Steph Curry for the former president’s initiative My Brother's Keeper Alliance. It will be live-streamed from Oakland, Calif., starting at 7:15 p.m. Eastern time.

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “My point here is that if they believe that Donald Trump cannot fulfill the obligations of his office, then they have a constitutional responsibility to invoke the 25th Amendment. Their loyalty under law is not to him personally. It is to the Constitution of the United States and to the people of United States.” — Elizabeth Warren on McCabe’s claim that he and Rosenstein discussed removing Trump from office.

This is how the culture of sexual assault, harassment and the disempowerment of women persists.”

It’s a date, to borrow Franklin D. Roosevelt’s iconic phrase, which will live in infamy. FDR used that wording to describe Japan’s December 7, 1941 sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. Just 74 days later, however, Roosevelt ceded some of the moral high ground with Executive Order 9066, authorizing the forced relocation of persons of Japanese descent living on the West Coast into wartime internment camps.

Most of the men, women, and children covered by Roosevelt’s edict were naturalized or American-born citizens. The stated rationale for incarcerating them in rural prison camps was espionage -- or, even more cynically -- their own safety. The true causes were wartime hysteria, racism, and pent-up jealousy over the commercial and agricultural success of Japanese immigrants (issei) and their descendants, the nisei (second-generation) and sansei (third-generation).

And so, from Washington state to Arizona, 120,000 innocent people were rounded up under this order. The hypocrisy of the entire program was underscored by the fact that in the Hawaiian Islands, where Japanese spies were living in the population, no mass roundup occurred: There were simply too many Japanese-Americans there to do anything about it.

I’ve written about this shameful chapter in American history previously. But nations, like human beings, have the ability to atone for their transgressions. Although it took more than four decades, that is precisely what the United States of America ultimately did. Again, it was a U.S. president who reflected the nation’s ethos -- this time its hopes, not its fears.

Every one of the Japanese-American citizens and Japanese residents rounded up in 1942 had a story of woe. Many sold their homes, shops, and farms at fire-sale prices; others were taken out of school and workplaces; some bade tearful goodbyes to friends, neighbors, and, in some cases, loved ones. For most, the feelings of betrayal never went away.

Among many young men in the Japanese community, both in Hawaii and on the mainland, the first impulse was to enlist in the military. Here, too, they were thwarted. Honolulu-born pre-med student Daniel Inouye got around this prohibition by serving as a medical volunteer. In 1943, when the ban was lifted, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the all-nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team.

This unit initially had trouble cohering: The culture shock between the free-wheeling Hawaiian-born “Buddha-heads” and the nervous men from the mainland whose families were still incarcerated was difficult to overcome. Rigorous training brought the soldiers together, however, and after George C. Marshall personally inspected the 442nd it was dispatched to the battlefields of Europe.

The regiment’s motto was “Go for Broke!” and in Italy, France, and Germany they lived up to it. Of the 14,000 men who served under its banner, 680 were confirmed killed in action, with another 67 missing, and many more wounded. The unit -- 4,500 at full strength and constantly being reinforced -- was one of the most decorated in the war. It was awarded a total of 9,486 Purple Hearts. Dan Inouye, not yet 20 years old when he went into combat, lost his right arm in battle, but remained in the military until 1947, retiring from the U.S. Army -- but not American public life -- as a captain. After Hawaii gained statehood, he became its first member of Congress. Two years later, he became a U.S. senator.

Sacramento-born Robert Takeo Matsui, a third-generation sansei, was 6 months old when his family was ordered into the camps. Fifty years later, he’d still get tears in his eyes and a catch in his voice when recalling what it meant to his mother to be treated like a criminal during World War II. Worse than a criminal, really: No one sent to the relocation camps was ever given a trial.

Matsui grew up, went to UC-Berkeley, then law school, entered politics as a Sacramento city councilman. Elected to Congress in a special election in 1978, he is remembered as a quiet but determined man of utter and consistent decency.

Bob Matsui died 14 years ago at age 63. Soon thereafter, his wife, Doris, ran in another special election, and serves in Congress to this day. She, too, was a child of the relocation camps -- literally -- having been born in southwestern Arizona’s Poston War Relocation Center, the largest of the internment camps.

It may seem incongruous, but there were many uplifting stories from the internment camps besides babies being born. My favorite involves two Boy Scouts who were 11 years old when they became fast friends in the camp at Heart Mountain in Wyoming.

One was an internee from San Jose, Calif., named Norman Y. Mineta. The other a lanky white kid from nearby Cody named Alan Simpson. The nisei scoutmasters, trying to keep things as normal as possible for their young charges, decided to host a jamboree and invited the nearby troop. The kids from Cody balked, but their scoutmaster insisted.

Once inside the barbed-wire gates, they intermingled, as boys will do. For reasons neither of them could ever quite explain, young Norm Mineta and young Al Simpson hit it off immediately. Their alliance was rekindled in Washington, D.C., in the late 1970s. Simpson arrived as a Republican senator from Wyoming. Mineta was already here, one of the stars of the fabled “Watergate” class of House Democrats elected in 1974.

Together, with help from Inouye, Matsui, and many others, the two men worked for a decade on passing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. It compensated the survivors of the internment camps with $20,000 in a tax-free payment -- hardly enough -- along with an official apology.

It was signed into law on Aug. 10, 1988 by President Reagan, who made a point of mentioning the tribulations of Norm Mineta and his family. As Mineta watched solemnly from the audience, the president described how the Minetas were taken from their homes in San Jose, sent by train to Santa Anita Racetrack, where they showered in the paddock, and then were shipped to Heart Mountain where the entire family lived in a one-room shack.

“The legislation that I am about to sign provides for a restitution payment to each of the 60,000 surviving Japanese-Americans of the 120,000 who were relocated or detained,” Reagan said. “Yet no payment can make up for those lost years. So, what is most important in this bill has less to do with property than with honor. For here we admit a wrong; here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.”

The president also paid homage to the famed all-nisei regiment, focusing on the central injustice: “The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up entirely of Japanese-Americans, served with immense distinction to defend this nation, their nation,” he noted. “Yet back at home, the soldiers' families were being denied the very freedom for which so many of the soldiers themselves were laying down their lives.”

Here, Reagan wasn’t just reading something drafted by his speechwriters. The 77-year-old president knew more about this than anyone on the White House staff. He knew about some of that ugly wartime prejudice because he was there. Reagan recalled the saga of Kazuo Masuda, a decorated veteran of the 442nd who was killed in Italy. While the 25-year-old Sgt. Masuda was giving his life for his country, his family was held behind the barbed wire at a relocation camp in Arizona. Even after the war, his sister Mary was threatened when she returned to her Southern California farm. An Orange County cemetery refused to inter Sgt. Masuda’s remains.

This did not go well down with the U.S. Army brass. An incensed Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell went personally to Orange County, where he publicly pinned Kazuo Masuda’s Distinguished Service Cross on his sister’s lapel. Other dignitaries attended the ceremony, too, including Will Rogers Jr. and a 34-year-old film star who’d served stateside during the war as a U.S. Army captain.

“Blood that has soaked into the sands of a beach is all one color,” the actor said that day. “America stands unique in the world: the only country not founded on race, but on an ideal. Not in spite of that, but because of, our polyglot background, we have all the strength in the world. That is the American way.”

The actor, of course, was Ronald Reagan. His remarks were not just an overt rebuke of racism, they were also a subtle reproach of Franklin Roosevelt, a president he had long admired. Reagan never mentioned Roosevelt in this context, then or later. But on that day in 1988, he did mention Kaz Masuda while recalling his own remarks made four decades earlier. “And yes,” Reagan said, “the ideal of liberty and justice for all -- that is still the American way.”

At this point, not only have the two “assailants” in the alleged hate crime been released but sources inside the Chicago PD are saying that they are no longer even suspects. The cops have video footage of pretty much Smollett’s entire trip to the Subway shop and back, with no indication of anyone else to blame. For their part, the two men are claiming they aren’t racists, criminals or even Trump critics. Smollett’s story is growing more and more hollow by the day.

This leaves the police investigating the incident with limited options. One of them, of course, would be to pull Smollett in for another interview and ask yet again for a look at his phone. But the “victim” in the attack has no plans to cooperate. (Associated Press)

Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault. Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

How does Jussie Smollett plan on squaring this decision with the public as he continues to plead his case? Let’s just say for the moment that he really was attacked by two people wearing masks and MAGA hats. The first two people arrested have been cleared. Wouldn’t he want to do everything possible to ensure that “the real hate crime attackers” were found and brought to justice? If he’s really the victim in all of this, what would he possibly have to fear from talking to the cops again? Perhaps he can recall more information to help them track the bad guys down.

And what’s his excuse for not turning over his phone? He says he has private pictures, emails, etc. on there, but everyone does. The cops probably don’t care about his social life or photos of his cat. What they likely want to know is if he was actually on the phone with his manager at the time of the alleged attack, as both of them have claimed. That might clear up some issues for him unless there never was any such phone call.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s attackers/friends are turning on him. That may not be terribly surprising since Smollett reportedly told the police he was willing to file charges against them until he learned they’d been picked up. (Washington Times)

The two men who were arrested on suspicion of committing a hate crime against actor Jussie Smollett denied attacking the black, gay actor or having any prejudice against him. In a statement released through their lawyers to Chicago media, brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo said they are cooperating with law enforcement. “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” the two said in a statement quoted by CNN.

To steal a line from The Lord of the Rings, Smollets list of allies is growing thin. The police seem to have a lot of details now in terms of what really happened. The three men allegedly ran rehearsals of the attack in advance and cruised the neighborhood looking for a place to stage it that would draw the most attention. But I’m also having trouble seeing how Smollett comes clean and admits it was all a hoax after calling anyone and everyone who questioned his account a pack of massive liars. Unless there’s some new, totally unexpected development here, Jussie Smollett appears to have already burned every bridge that might have gotten him out of this mess."

If you’re curious about his role, read on.

TMZ was first to name the Olabinjo (“Ola”) and Abimbola (“Abel”) Osundairo, who police identified as persons of interest and then possible suspects before releasing them and saying the case had taken a turn. They now hope to interview Smollett.

Police have not identified the brothers, but they said in a statement Monday: “”We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

The statement address the many theories of the case in news reports and social media. Smollett said on Jan. 29 that he was attacked by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.”

TheWrap was able to confirm Ola’s role on “Empire” through both his brother, Abel, and through their lawyer Gloria Schmidt. Fox broadcast network has not responded to our requests regarding any additional details of Ola’s Episode 201 role. The studio did not have a comment when reached.

In his first scene, Ola plays one of Frank Gathers’ (Chris Rock) enforcers who just roughed up a fellow inmate.

In his second scene, Ola is just a background actor while Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) visits Lucious (Terrence Howard) in prison. He has no lines in either scene, and does not share any screen time with Smollett in the episode.

One of the fan mails also comes from Anu, who praised the direction of the podcast.

Men are scum on Valentine’s Day?

‘Men are scum’ is the female activist quip against the unfaithfulness and more unsavory parts of the modern man, in his 20s or early 30s, breaking hearts and soaking up the madness of youth. But close to Valentine’s Day, the women never repeat the rhetoric for reasons unknown to the average man.

Valentine's Day a season of love. (Chindustry)

The gang discusses the immediate past Valentine’s Day from this perspective. Steve also discusses how every day is Valentine’s Day celebration for himself and his wife - Valentine’s is just another day.

Election postponement

Upon the very sad postponement of the 2019 Presidential Elections, initially scheduled for Saturday, February 16, 2019, and the backlash that came in the wake of it, the gang discusses their various actions on that day and try to evaluate the problems around that day and the terrible mobile network from that day.

The gang also discusses the terrible conspiracy theories around the events of that day, the level of complicity by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the planned celebrations for that day from which certain people suffered a disadvantage.

More importantly, as the poster boy for emigration to Canada, the ‘SDC’ himself eulogizes his 'adopted country.'

Davido vs, Wizkid

On the matter of the elections, the gang breaks down the supposed game of subs and how the fans play a role in what could turn out to be a pointless battle of 'stan culture' that could escalate into a real-life battle as the American East-West coast battle festered.

On the matter of @_t.lolo vs. Davido, the gang peruses the matter of how personal bias and vested interests influence political alliance. The issue of pointless celebrity witch-hunt and the madness in the wake of Davido's Valentine's Day video with Chef Chioma was also discussed.

Other issues discussed were Gbenro Ajibade vs. Osas Ighodaro-Ajibade, Jussie Smollett and other necessary topics."

Ola and Abel Asundairo knew Smollett, with one of the brothers being hired as his personal trainer, Smollett confirmed in a statement released by his lawyers.

Smollett has maintained his innocence and his lawyers said that it would be “impossible” to believe that the Asundairos had anything to do with the alleged attack. He initially blamed the attack on supporters of President Donald Trump.

The brothers said in a joint statement to CBS Chicago on Feb. 18 that they are not against Trump and that they are not racist. They also disputed reports that they were born in Nigeria.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” they said in the statement.

“In due course, all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible,” added the brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt.

Police officers searched the brothers’ home last week and took a number of items, including a thumb drive, an “Empire” script, a black face mask, cellphones, and a laptop.

Law enforcement sources previously told CBS Chicago that the brothers told detectives they were paid $3,500 to stage the attack and that Smollett had them rehearse it several days prior to the Jan. 29 incident. They left for Nigeria later that day and were allegedly told they’d get another $500 when they returned to the United States.

Sources also gave Fox 32 the same information.

The brothers may also be behind a letter sent to Smollett that included hateful messages. Detectives took a magazine “similar to the one that was used to cut out letters for the hate mail that was sent to Smollett prior to the reported attack,” reported Fox.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the older brother pleaded guilty to aggravated battery in 2012 and was sentenced to two years of probation for being one of five people who stabbed a 17-year-old in 2011. The younger brother was ticketed for driving under the influence in 2015.

According to the Tribune, the brothers are of Nigerian descent. One attended high school in Chicago while the other received his secondary education in Chicago. They both attended Quincy University, a small liberal arts college in Illinois. Both owe tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. They filed for bankruptcy in 2016, saying they had a party and decoration store but it dissolved because it was “operating at a loss.”

Smollett was following the brothers’ bodybuilding page on Instagram and at least one picture showed both brothers on the set of “Empire,” where they posed with director Lee Daniels and reportedly played minor roles in an episode.

The brothers have also appeared in “Chicago P.D.” and the 2017 movie “The Worst Nightmare.” One appeared in Spike Lee’s 2015 film “Chi-Raq.”

Latest From Police, Smollett

The Chicago Police Department hasn’t confirmed reports on what the brothers told detectives but did say they were released after initially being arrested.

In a statement, a police spokesman said that information the brothers relayed “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

“We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

In an update on Monday, Smollett’s team said: “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment.”

Police told Rafer Weigel, a Fox Chicago reporter, that “it’s certainly possible” that the case will go to a grand jury but that “it’s way too premature” to make that determination.

The grand jury could be a last resort if Smollett doesn’t voluntarily go in for questioning, a spokesman said and noted the actor’s lawyers have given no indication to the police that he was planning on going in for questioning."

The Empire actor told police last month that he had been attacked by two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs near his Chicago home. By Friday, local police had released two men they’d picked up as suspects. Multiple reports, citing law enforcement sources, suggested that officers now believe the incident was staged.

In the wake of the fresh reports in the quickly evolving case, many recognizable names spoke out.

Ava DuVernay, the director of A Wrinkle in Time and other movies, noted that she’s not inclined to “blindly believe” the Chicago police after previous scandals, such as the one in which Det. Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of murdering teen Laquan McDonald in 2014.

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 17, 2019

Outspoken rapper Cardi B had more to say in a five-minute clip on Instagram Live.

“I’m really disappointed in him,” she said of Smollett, if it turns out he hasn’t been truthful. “I feel like he f***ed up Black History Month, bro.” Cardi B added that she was also suspicious of the cops and recounted her own experience with them. If Smollett lied, she said, she wanted to know the reason. “Why would you do that, bro?”

Meanwhile, Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney kept his reaction short and simple.

President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. took the opportunity to retweet a joke about comedian Kathy Griffin, who’s infamously clashed with his father, on Sunday. Of course, Griffin had a retort.

It’s like clockwork with you two ladies. You and your father,(who hates you.)

I retweet one of the dads typical stupid tweets, my response gets a ton of traction, then jr hops on instantly, and plagiarizes a tweet that’s been around for at least 12 hours. You really showed me.🤣 pic.twitter.com/yh6AJjkwkL — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) February 17, 2019

For his part, Smollett denies faking the attack. In an interview last week on Good Morning America, he said he was “pissed off” at the suggestion he was lying.

His attorneys gave an additional statement to CNN over the weekend, as the case developed:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” they said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom fiercely defended Smollett when reports of the alleged attack first surfaced, have now said they are withholding judgment until there are more facts.

ABC employees were dubious about Jussie Smollett’s alleged racist and homophobic assault immediately following his interview with Robin Roberts, a new report says.

Staffers who were present for the exclusive sit-down with the “Good Morning America” host felt the truth behind Smollett’s story was “up in the air,” sources told The Blast.

A source told The Post that the interview came about because the “Empire” star was “adamant” about appearing on “GMA.”

He specifically requested that Roberts handle the interview because the two knew each other from when she appeared on an episode of “Empire” that aired in April, according to The Blast.

Smollett has claimed he was attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29 but suspicions have surfaced that he paid two brothers to stage the assault.

The veteran broadcaster probed Smollett about his allegations in many different ways during the interview that aired Thursday, but he maintained that he was a victim.

During the sit-down, Smollett also tamped down doubts over his account of what happened.

“At first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it because it’s the truth,” he said at the time. “Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth.”

On Monday, Roberts addressed the growing controversy surrounding Smollett’s story.

“When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account, publicly give his first account of what he said happened,” Roberts said on “Good Morning America.”

“At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. Now this was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

A grand jury will begin hearing evidence as early as Tuesday that could result in felony charges against Smollett, TMZ reported. He could be charged with filing a false police report."

""When the letter didn't get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,"" a source told WBBM-TV, CBS 2. Other sources corroborated that information to the CBS affiliate.

The brothers, who are no longer considered suspects in the attack, have told police that they were paid to stage the attack because Smollett was disappointed to the reaction the letter received, WLS-TV, ABC 7 in Chicago reported.

""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,"" brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo said in a statement to WLS-TV.

The siblings worked on ""Empire"" as extras and one was reportedly Smollett's personal trainer.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told authorities he was attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

His lawyers claim their client is being ""further victimized"" by media reports that he staged the assault.

Chicago police issued a statement on Saturday confirming they had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" adding, ""We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett's lawyers said Monday he was not meeting with police that day, but did not reveal whether an interview was slated for later this week.

Following the reported attack, Smollett's colleagues, employer, civil and gay rights leaders, legislators and President Donald Trump expressed support and outrage at the attack that the actor described.

TMZ reported Tuesday that Smollett's on-screen time in an episode now being filmed is ""getting slashed in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the so-called 'attack'."""

Now, she’s written an op-ed for the Washington Post and slammed the lack of action from the Virginia General Assembly.

In the column, Watson stressed that she has been seeking a public hearing in vain.

“I have brought forward credible allegations, the Virginia General Assembly has not taken the simple and responsible step of arranging the thorough public hearing that we have sought,” Watson wrote in the op-ed published Monday afternoon. “This is how the culture of sexual assault, harassment and the disempowerment of women persists.”

She also explained how she has turned down all interview requests.

“Since I came forward less than two weeks ago, certain politicians offered to support me if I made it a partisan issue. I refused,” Watson wrote. “Likewise, I have refused to make this a financial issue by suing for compensation. I have refused to make it a law-enforcement issue. Despite nearly 100 offers to be interviewed, I have refused to make my rape a media opportunity.”

Within days of Watson going public, her own past was scrutinized. According to Politico, Maryland court records indicated that an unidentified man took out a restraining order against Watson in July 2008. In a petition for the restraining order, the man said Watson “was detaining me against my will … [and] not letting me leave” a vacation home in Corolla, N.C., and “dented the trunk” of his vehicle with her fist. Watson was also accused of showing up at the man’s house saying “she was going to kill herself” and sending “threatening text messages.”

The court apparently took the allegations seriously enough to grant the temporary restraining order.

Watson’s lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, said it was a seven-day court order and that Watson “was not in the courtroom and did not know about the proceedings or have an opportunity to be heard.” She also said the man “abandoned the effort after hearing from Ms. Watson’s lawyer.” Smith also claimed the dispute was about $2,000 that was owed to Watson. Other than that, the nature of Watson’s relationship with the man was not immediately disclosed.

“The man who filed the request for the order did not respond to a request for comment for this story, nor did Fairfax through his office,” Politico reported.

In the op-ed for the Washington Post, Watson wrote, “I told my story, and in a single week my life was probed, exposed, examined and picked over. This is what women who come forward know to expect, and to fear. Few rape victims do come forward. The rapists shake free what soon becomes just a slight taint, and they move on.”

Lastly, she said she was “frustrated by calls for an investigation rather than a public hearing into these matters. Such ‘investigation’ are secret proceedings, out of the public eye, leaving victims vulnerable to selective leaks and smears. And we all know how such investigations end: with ‘inconclusive results.’ My privacy has already been violated, yet I am still willing to testify publicly under oath. Tyson has made the same offer. Our plea to the Virginia General Assembly to require the same of Fairfax has been met with inaction.”

Watson alleged Fairfax raped her while they were students at Duke University in 2000, according to a report from the Washington Post. Watson’s claim came less than a week after Vanessa Tyson said Fairfax forced her to give him oral sex during the summer of 2004.

Watson also claimed former NBA player and Fox Sports analyst Corey Maggette, who played at Duke for one year from 1998 to 1999, raped her, too.

Fairfax has denied both Tyson’s and Watson’s claims. Maggette has also denied Watson’s accusations.

“I deleted previous inaccurate tweets as more reports about Jussie Smollett come out,” Fallon said late Monday evening. “What a despicable act if updates are true: exploiting & amplifying the hate, division, & politicization; abusing media & police resources; and making it all the harder for victims to report.”

In one now-deleted tweet, Fallon also criticized supporters of President Trump for “providing artillery for weaponized bigotry.”

“People in MAGA hats recognized and then beat and poured bleach on Jussie Smollett, calling him that ‘faggot’ from Empire,” Fallon said in his tweet. “Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror.”

Also removed was another tweet: “Update after learning more: they wore ski masks, so as to cowardly not be recognized as they shouted ‘this is MAGA country’ and toed [sic] a rope around his neck like a noose.”

The two deleted tweets remained live long after Chicago authorities began to challenge Smollett’s account that two men in Chicago attacked and beat him while shouting “this is MAGA country” and racial and anti-gay epithets.

On Monday, CNN reported that its sources within the Chicago PD said that the “Empire” star staged the attack with two men whom he paid for the job. Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were initially detained as persons’s of interest in the case before ultimately being released. The same CNN report also said the brothers were now offering full cooperation with the police.

Daily Beast Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman declined to comment on the matter. Fallon and reps for the Daily Beast’s parent company, IAC, did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Fallon was far from alone among journalists who have commented on the Smollett story based on unconfirmed news reports and unfounded speculation. On the day Smollett first reported an attack to authorities, GQ writer Joshua Rivera called out the Chicago PD for calling the matter a “possible” hate crime — saying the cautious language was a further attack on Smollett.

“The cautious wording is one last wound inflicted on Smollett’s battered body, a careful hedging of bets that don’t need hedging,” he wrote.

A rep for the police did not immediately respond to request for comment from TheWrap about whether there had been any new developments in the case Tuesday morning, but in an earlier statement, Chicago Police Department chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi said that “the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Even as evidence has mounted against Smollett’s version of events, the star has continued to stand by his story.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” lawyers representing the actor said in a statement over the weekend. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s “Empire” showrunner Brett Mahoney also continued to stand by the star, tweeting on Monday that he still believed the embattled actor."

Police have not confirmed these reports.

THE LETTER: “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack” – CPD sources.



Jussie Smollett received a hate letter Jan. 22. It's that letter, the mail angle, that brought in the FBI. ""That makes any potential case a Federal one, if they want it."" pic.twitter.com/dTk2ECBvhU — Brad Edwards (@tvbrad) February 19, 2019

The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett. One had worked as an extra on the Empire set, and the other was a personal trainer who had worked with the actor. They were reportedly paid $3500 to stage the attack.

The brothers told CBS Chicago: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

CBS Chicago reports: ‘During the search of the brothers’ home last week, a “piece of paper/writing” was also seized. CBS 2 is the only news source with video from inside that house. Police evidence logs exclusively obtained by CBS 2, show investigators took the writing sample, magazine, and a “wallet with stamps.” Chicago police say the FBI is handling the investigation surrounding the letter, because that’s a federal-level concern.



CBS Chicago adds: ‘Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500.’

TMZ reports that they rehearsed the attack: ‘Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Abel and Ola Osundairo told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor’s apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action. Our sources say the brothers told police Jussie said he wanted to make it a “physical thing,” but not to the point he’d be seriously injured. On the night Jussie says he was attacked, the brothers claim they showed up at the scene but were extremely nervous because, just as they played out the scene, a car drove by and they were worried they’d be ID’d.’

TMZ is also reporting that Smollett’s upcoming scenes in Empire have been cut.

Chicago police are interested in questioning Smollett again. He has so far refused.

Smollett’s attorneys on Saturday denied he paid the brothers to stage the attack, saying, “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys released a new statement late yesterday: “We are not going to respond to every new, anonymous accusation or rumor. Jussie Smollett’s lawyers are in contact with the Chicago Police Department. Jussie will continue to cooperate with the investigation in an appropriate and respectful manner that does not include talking to media at this time.”"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

WASHINGTON — For all of the strengths that Bernie Sanders brings to the still-developing 2020 field — name ID, a formidable email list, progressive bona fides — he faces two enormous challenges as he makes his presidential announcement this morning.

The first: Can he compete in a much more crowded liberal/progressive lane than he encountered in 2016? Four years ago, he opened this lane and showed the party that voters will come. But now he’s got company – from progressive Elizabeth Warren, to the likes of Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who are all running under the “Medicare for All” banner.

This isn’t too different than what the Ron/Rand Paul family found out. In 2008 and then in 2012, Ron Paul opened the door to a much more libertarian message for the GOP. But by the time son Rand jumped into the presidential waters in 2016, other candidates had co-opted that message. (Of course, the un-libertarian in that field, Donald Trump, ended up winning the GOP nomination, though that’s a story for another day.)

In other words, by winning the message war in 2016, Sanders could become an also-ran four years later — because the new presidential field sounds a lot more like him.

The second challenge for Sanders: Can he convince rank-and-file Democratic primary voters to move on from 2016, which is an election cycle many of them want to forget? Consider what happened:

It took Sanders 36 days to endorse Hillary Clinton after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee (by contrast, it took Hillary four days to endorse Barack Obama after he became the presumptive nominee in 2008).

Even after Sanders endorsed and campaigned for Clinton, some of his top surrogates and supporters (Cornel West, Susan Sarandon) ended up voting for Jill Stein over Clinton.

Robert Mueller has evidence about how Russian intelligence strategized with WikiLeaks on the hacked DNC emails to produce divisions inside the Democratic Party before its 2016 convention. ""On or about July 6, 2016, Organization 1 added, 'if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] days prefable [sic] because the DNC [Democratic National Convention] is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after. The Conspirators responded, ""ok … i see.' Organization 1 explained, 'we think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary … so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting.'""

And it worked: Sanders got booed by his own delegates at the convention in Philadelphia when he said that “we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.”

Ask yourself: How many Democratic primary voters still get warm fuzzies thinking about all of that?

Both challenges for Sanders — a more crowded liberal lane and memories of 2016 – underscore this reality for the Vermont senator: The party has moved on and evolved from four years ago.

Can Bernie keep up?

Klobuchar: “I wish … I was a magic genie and could give [free college] to everyone”

While the liberal/progressive lane is much more crowded than it was in 2016, guess which lane isn’t as crowded – at least right now?

The pragmatic middle.

Here was Amy Klobuchar getting a question about free college at last night’s CNN town hall in New Hampshire: “I wish -- if I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, I would. I'm just trying to find a mix of incentives and make sure kids that are in need -- that's why I talked about expanding Pell Grants -- can go to college and be able to afford it and make sure that people that can't afford it are able to pay.”

And here she was on Medicare for All: “Well, I think it's something that we can look to for the future, but I want to get action now. And I think the best way we do that is something that we actually wanted to do back when we were looking at the Affordable Care Act and we were stopped, was trying to get a public option in there.”

Call it the physics of politics: For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction…

16 states sue Trump over his national emergency — and they use his words against him

NBC’s Jane Timm: “California, New York and 14 other states filed a lawsuit Monday challenging Donald Trump's national emergency declaration... Joining California in the suit are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Virginia.”

Oh, and guess what's on page 30 of the lawsuit:

At a press conference announcing the Executive Actions, President Trump acknowledged that Congress provided more than enough funding for homeland security, and that the Administration has “so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.” In explaining his rationale for the Executive Actions, the President candidly admitted that the emergency declaration reflected his personal preference to construct the wall more quickly, rather than an actual urgent need for it to be built immediately: “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster.”(The emphasis is ours.)

A new NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows 61 percent of Americans disapproving of Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency.

—Iconic Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld has died at 85—

Brothers Abimbola “Abel” Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo according to police sources have been fingered as possible co-conspirators who allegedly helped Smollett stage a hate crime attack, The Ny Daily News reports.

They released a joint statement saying:

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,” they said. “We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Chicago police confirmed on Saturday that the two brothers are the men in the surveillance video.

“Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video,” Chicago Police said in a statement to ABC7 Chicago. “The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”

Sources reportedly told CBS 2 Chicago and ABC News that Smollett enlisted the Osundairo because he was upset that a threatening letter that was sent to him on the set of Empire in Chicago didn’t conjure up the reaction he wanted.

The note reportedly read: “Smollett Jussie you will die black f–,” and included a stick-figure drawing hanging from a tree next to a gun.

—Sen. Bernie Sanders says he’s running for president in 2020—

Smollett reported that he was attacked after a late-night run to Smollett and that two men screamed obscenities and called him a “f****t,” and “n****r.”

Smollett and the brothers share a common connection and worked together on Empire as extras.

Smollett’s attorneys as of Monday said he would not be speaking with Chicago police for a follow-up interview at this time. They released this statement over the weekend saying:

Smollett is “angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

TMZ reports that a grand jury will be convened."

The investigation into the alleged hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett has begun to affect his work according to TMZ.

In the wake of growing speculation on whether or not the attack was orchestrated, reports state that Smollet’s role on the show has been significantly decreased. For example, a source close to production says that Jussie was to be featured 9 scenes plus in a big musical act during the penultimate episode. He’s now been cut down to 5 scenes and the musical portion has been completely removed. Re-writes and edits happen all the time during production, but the source seems to be indicating that this is being done to take the focus off of Jussie.

The focus will now be on the ensemble cast and Jussie’s featured storyline will be couched. In fact, it’s said that he will only be on set two times this week.

Jussie’s hate crime case will be presented to a Grand Jury early this week and a TMZ source in the Chicago P.D. says the plan is to show evidence that he filed a false police report and staged the attack.

Guess we’ll all have to wait and see how this plays out. It’s not beyond the police to lie, especially in Chicago.

What do you make of all this?"

Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the buzzy Fox drama is reportedly losing a lot of screen time as a result of the ongoing investigation into the alleged attack on the actor.

TMZ is reporting that Smollett's role is being drastically scaled back as questions continue to mount about what really transpired in the lead-up to the actor seeking treatment and telling law enforcement he was attacked.

Production on the penultimate episode of Empire Season 5 is well underway, and website is reporting that five of Smollett's nine scenes have been cut.

Related: Fox Standing By Jussie Smollett Following Reports He Staged Attack

What's more, a musical number has also been giving the chop. In the scenes he will appear in, his cast members will be part of them, meaning Smollett will not be the focus.

The actor was originally supposed to be reporting for duty on the set every day this week, but he'll now allegedly only be around on Thursday and Friday.

As if that was not bad enough, writers are working around the clock to fill in the blanks for the scenes that have been cut.

Following the alleged January 29 attack, Smollett told cops that he was walking home around 2 a.m. after getting some food.

He said two men attacked him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured a substance believed to be bleach all over his body.

The plot thickened over the weekend when more details about the incident started to come to light, and CBS and ABC affiliates reported that Smollett could have staged the whole thing.

Nigerian brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were identified as suspects, and the story started to unravel when it emerged that Smollett knew the men well.

They were not white, which conflicts with the claim Smollett made to the police that it was two white men who carried out the attack.

Both men were let go without charge.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Friday evening.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

TMZ reported that the two brothers were cooperating with authorities, and were spilling everything.

They even went as far as saying the attack was rehearsed, and that they scouted a location with Jussie, and that the actor picked one that was right next to a camera.

As for Jussie, he is maintaining that he played no role in the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" reads a statement on behalf of the actor.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.""

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Yesterday, two famous progs started the campaign to treat Jussie as a victim of a psychiatric malady and therefore properly given treatment, not a prison sentence of up to three years.

The specter of a new ""trial of the century"" for Jussie Smollett, over what looks like his staging of a fake hate crime, is scaring the leaders of the identity politics movement that dominates the Democratic Party. Two presidential candidates, Cory Booker and Smollett's longstanding friend and associate, Kamala Harris, immediately endorsed and exploited the burst of saturation coverage by the national media to hype the ""anti-lynching law"" they have been using to burnish their credentials with the victimologist constituency.

Rep. Eric Swalwell has taken time off from his incessant unproven claims of Trump collusion with Russia to express sympathy for poor Jussie and ""hope he gets the help he needs.""

I am certain that he does not regard a stretch in Stony Lonesome as ""help."" More like an expensive, cushy, private psychiatric hospital, the sort of place other celebrities go for ""recovery"" from substance abuse and sexual predation charges. Because Swalwell is ""very close"" to making his 2020 presidential campaign announcement, he has a lot at stake in maintaining the narrative that keeps blacks and gays on the Democrats' plantation.

Charles Blow, the race-obsessed New York Times editorial board member, thinks Smollett — a ""most gracious person"" — must be insane, or at least a psychopath. The possibility that he carefully calculated a stunt that (had it not been botched) could have made him a superstar does not seem to occur to him (one-minute video):

The Chicago Police Department wisely is keeping as tight a lid as possible on its investigation because premature official disclosure could damage the trial. But leaks by rank-and-file cops to local Chicago media (who have shown up the national media for the shallow drive-by propagandists they are) and careful analysis primarily by conservative bloggers allow us to put together a plausible hypothesis of the actual plan Smollett had in mind — a plan that could have worked and catapulted him into the ranks of civil rights heroes, political influencers, and multimedia superstars.

Of course, I must include the disclaimer that all the facts are not yet on the table and that we can't say with 100% certainty that Smollett hoaxed us. So, yes, he is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and what follows is supposition based on unofficial information. That said, we're not morons, so we can put two and two together and tentatively infer what the plan was.

John Nolte of Breitbart has done exactly that in a must-read article.

The most important dot to connect to all ... comes from Smollett himself, who told Good Morning America (GMA) last week that he suspected a surveillance camera caught the whole incident. Speaking to GMA's Robin Roberts, Smollett said, ""And I looked up and I saw there was a camera directly on the light post that is in the intersection. So I'm like, 'there it is!' ... And then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north, so they didn't have it, and that was disappointing."" That detail appears to stick in his craw. Later in the interview, unprompted, he brings it up again: ""The camera facing north, how is that my issue?""



File photo via Flickr.

Here is the full 16-minute interview. (Roberts's softball approach to a story that already had big holes showing is already causing her grief.)

So it appears that Smollett intended the staged attack to be recorded but botched the location because he did not realize that the CCTV surveillance camera was pointed in the opposite direction. Recall that the Nigerian brothers — one an extra on his show, the other his personal trainer — reportedly rehearsed the attack with Smollett, meaning that this professional actor was probably able to stage a convincing video. The very night of the failed staging for the surveillance camera, Smollett has just returned from New York City, where he had performed hours before a startlingly similar scenario, as the U.K. Daily Mail reports:

DailyMail.com has learned that Smollett landed in Chicago shortly after midnight following a lengthy plane delay out of LaGuardia. He had been in New York City for a reading of the play Take Me Out, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Smollett was being considered to appear in a possible revival of the Tony-winning production about a biracial baseball star who comes out as gay. The script for that play finds the lead character being attacked by a new pitcher who joins the team. That character uses the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including 'f-----' and 'n-----.'

Nolte continues:

[I]t's easy to see what he could have gained — had the altercation occurred in front of any of the other cameras he walked past that night. First off, he despises Trump and, it seems, Trump's supporters, and this was an easy way to smear both, especially in a world with a corrupt media that is always eager to spread any kind of fake news or hoax that makes Trump or his supporters look evil. There is also Smollett's debut album, which is scheduled to hit store shelves on March 2, and the live performances promoting the album, which began just a few days after the attack. ... Imagine what it would have done to this country and to the city of Chicago if the attack had been recorded, if an outlet like TMZ had leaked the video, and if the wildly irresponsible race baiters at CNN had broadcast that video over and over and over again — an endless loop of two men assaulting a gay, black man; pouring bleaching [sic] on him and tying a noose around his neck. It would have been just like that other media hoax — ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" — and we all know what that led to: the destruction of a predominantly black neighborhood in the ensuing riots.

Those of us old enough to remember the 1992 riots in Los Angeles triggered by endless broadcasts of the (edited) tape of police officers beating Rodney King understand the potential for civil strife had similar media treatment been possible for the fictional ""MAGA attack."" Would the Chicago Police Department have been able to devote major resources to investigating the signs of hoax had video been available? Consider the demonization heaped upon skeptics of Smollett's tale, claims that they were victimizing him again. Video evidence would have closed the case, in my opinion. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson likely would have denied requests to investigate any of the red flags in Smollett's tale had the city been wracked by riots.

It almost worked, but for Smollett choosing the wrong CCTV camera for his stunt. Now it is a crisis for Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Robin Roberts, and many other pols (like Nancy Pelosi, who deleted her tweet on the attack) and media figures who jumped on the incident, accepting Smollett's tale as gospel and victimizing me and every other Trump-supporter."

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Police detained two brothers, identified as Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo last week, who were recognized from surveillance footage taken in the area of the alleged assault."

His prized role on the career-making series “Empire,” has been greatly reduced amid the growing sentiment that he staged his own racist and homophobic attack in January — one that made international headlines.

His career is in peril, his future with “Empire” is in immediate jeopardy, and he may be slapped with felony indictments if prosecutors are convinced he lied to Chicago police.

Sources close to the producers on the show snitched to TMZ and said that Smollett was supposed to have major screen time as they worked on the second to last episode of the season, but now his role has been slashed nearly in half.

Smollett’s story about being ambushed last month is apparently unraveling rapidly. He told authorities that he was attacked in the middle of the night in Chicago by two men who shouted racist and homophobic obscenities. The attack reportedly intensified when the men said “This is MAGA country” on Jan. 29. They also allegedly poured a corrosive chemical on him and put a noose around his neck.

The two men who were eventually detained turned out to be brothers from Nigeria who worked as extras on the show that Smollett is a star on, “Empire.” It’s also been revealed that the three are friends and reportedly worked out together. Worse, the brothers said Smollett paid them $3500 to help stage the hoax and had promised another $500 upon their return from Nigeria.

Smollett, as the sources told TMZ, was supposed to have nine scenes and a major musical number in the second to the last episode. However, the news outlet has since been told that five of his scenes have been cut out, and his musical number has been killed.

For the remaining scenes that he is in, Smollett might as well be an extra, as TMZ puts it. In those scenes, Smollett is part of an ensemble and has no real presence.

Because his role has been paired down at the last minute, the writers have had to put in overtime to piece together major edits and revisions to the script.

Smollett’s role reduction is the least of his concerns at the moment. TMZ also reports that his case is heading to a Grand Jury as possible as early as today (Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019). Chicago police sources indicated they will be presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report."

Harris, while on her first campaign trip to New Hampshire yesterday, seemed to stumble when asked about the situation. “‘Which tweet? What tweet?’ Ms. Harris said in response to the question about her use of the ‘modern day lynching’ phrase,” as Katharine Seelye of The Times reported. “After a moment, she said, ‘I think the facts are still unfolding and I’m very concerned’ about the initial allegation by Mr. Smollett. She said ‘there should be an investigation’ and declined to comment further until it was complete.”

Her final instinct there was the best one. Making sweeping pronouncements about unverified criminal allegations isn’t a good idea — not now, not three weeks ago. It’s especially problematic with matters involving race, gender and sexuality, which ignite particular political passions.

Everyone — and definitely anyone running for president — should know by now that it’s O.K. to wait before weighing in on a hot topic. As the most recent Democratic president famously said, “I like to know what I’m talking about before I speak.”

For more on the Smollett case, Noah Rothman has an Op-Ed in the Times .

The bigger picture

I think this story is worth mentioning because Harris is the closest thing right now to a Democratic front-runner. The launch of her campaign has been impressive, with large, excited crowds. She also seems (along with Beto O’Rourke) to have the clearest potential to knit together different Democratic Party constituencies in a primary, as Nate Silver has explained."

THE ATTACK ON American actor Jussie Smollett prompted an outpouring of sympathy and outrage from the worlds of celebrity to politics, with even presidential candidates speaking about the young star’s hospitalisation.

Now, those who spoke out are holding their judgment amid a lack of clarity over what happened and claims that the actor himself may have played a role in the attack on him.

Smollet’s lawyers have said there is no truth these reports and added that he feels “victimised” by them.

So what do we know so far?

On 29 January in Chicago, Smollett was hospitalised after being assaulted in the early hours of the morning in what police began investigating as a suspected hate crime.

Smollett said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting “This is MAGA country!’, as well as racial and anti-gay slurs.

Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance over him.

The attack prompted celebrities and politicians to come out in solidarity with Smollett, including Democratic candidates Senator Kamala Harris and Cory Booker who both compared it to a modern-day lynching.

Over the weekend however, the narrative around the story changed when police said the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges.

Police also said they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

The two brothers have been named by US media as Ola and Abel Osundairo and CBS News has reported, citing police sources, that they told detectives that Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack.

The report further stated that the men left Chicago to go to Nigeria on the day of the attack before returning last Wednesday when they were arrested.

At least one of the brothers worked as an extra on Empire, the show Smollett starred in.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS that the pair were released and that the investigation had changed.

We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.

In a follow-up tweet on Sunday, Guglielmi acknowledged that there were further reports in the media about the case and again repeated that Chicago Police were seeking to speak to Smollett.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” the spokesperson told reporters.

While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident. pic.twitter.com/b9GgXbSUt9 — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 17, 2019 Source: Anthony Guglielmi /Twitter

Smollett’s lawyers said on Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police and that he felt victimised by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to disbelief to those who are urging caution.

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 17, 2019 Source: Ava DuVernay /Twitter

Senator Harris said she won’t comment again on the investigation until it is completed.

Speaking yesterday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Harris said that “the facts are still unfolding” and said she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and added that it should be taken seriously.

After reports that Smollett was due to meet with investigators, lawyers representing him said yesterday that there were currently no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives.

A spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers told the Associated Press in an email that his legal team “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Noah began by calling the possibility of Smollett staged his own hate crime “insane,” but admitted that there was a “certain part of the story that was always weird.”

“Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch ‘Empire?’” Noah asked. “It’s like a member of the Klan buying tickets to see ‘”Fiddler on the Roof.’”

JUSSIE SMOLLETT SAYS HE'S 'PISSED OFF' ABOUT REACTION TO ALLEGED HATE CRIME ATTACK

The Comedy Central star told his audience that the only part of Smollett’s “weird” story that “makes sense” to him was that he reportedly rehearsed the attack with two Nigerian brothers who he paid to take part in the hoax a few days prior.

ROBIN ROBERTS: COPS SAID JUSSIE SMOLLETT ACCOUNT WAS CREDIBLE AT TIME OF 'GMA' INTERVIEW

“If I was paying these two to beat me up, I would want to practice too, OK?” Noah said while pointing to a photo of the brothers. “Look at this photo — how many abs does the guy on the left have? It looks like he stole a couple of abs from the other guy!”

The “Daily Show” host then played a clip from Smollett’s tearful interview on “Good Morning America,” where he told Robin Roberts he hoped his alleged attackers would get caught.

“Either this guy is telling the truth or he deserves an Emmy for that interview,” Noah reacted. “Because if all of that was just a performance, I don’t care what he’s lying about, you can’t cancel him. He’s too good to not be on TV!”

'EMPIRE' SHOWRUNNER STANDS BY JUSSIE SMOLLETT

Late last month, Smollett claimed that he was assaulted by two Trump supporters when he went out for a Subway sandwich at 2 a.m. in Chicago during the polar vortex. He said he was beaten, was called racial and homophobic slurs, had a rope around his neck, and was told that “this is MAGA country.”

However, numerous local reports in Chicago have weakened Smollett’s claims since the alleged incident took place.

However, as police continue to investigate the matter, Smollett’s role is reportedly being reduced on Empire according to chatter on the set.

TMZ reports:

Production sources tell TMZ … Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode — which is being shot now — but, 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d.

As for the remaining 4 scenes … we’re told he’s no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he’s flanked by a number of cast members.

With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we’re told Jussie’s working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

Less work for Jussie means more work for writers, who are busy making edits. In the past 24 hours, we’re told the script has undergone multiple revisions.

The outlet adds that Smollett’s case is due to be heard before a grand jury in the city of Chicago and that the actor could face charges over filing a false police report.

The alleged assault, on January 29, saw two men hurl racist and homophobic slurs at the actor as he returned to his Chicago home.

However the narrative took an unexpected turn when Chicago law enforcement sources told CNN that the assault may have been planned by the actor- allegations which Smollett has denied.

Following the revelations of an alleged hoax attack orchestrated by the actor, figures including Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker and Senator Kamala Harris were asked to respond to earlier messages of support they had offered the star.

American attorney Michael Avenatti has apologized for calling the attack on Jussie Smollett a 'hate crime' after claims surfaced that the attack may have been a hoax

In a tweet the Attorney wrote: 'I am extremely disappointed that J. Smollett staged a hate crime'

Yesterday, in a message posted on Twitter, Mr Avenatti, joined the list of people asked to comment on the alleged attack.

He wrote: 'I am extremely disappointed that J. Smollett staged a hate crime.

'I apologize for my comment made immediately after the news broke. Without firsthand knowledge, I should have known better than to place any faith in the accusations until an investigation was done by me or others.'

Days before the alleged attack on the Empire actor, on January 22, Chicago Police confirmed that a threatening letter containing a powdery substance, later confirmed to be crushed aspirin, had been sent to Cinespace Studios addressed to Smollett.

Actor Jussie Smollett claims that he was attacked by two men on January 29 as he was returning home. He told officers that his attackers hit him, threw racial and homophobic slurs at him and also poured bleach over him

On the letter were the words 'you will die black f*g' and the letters MAGA, which stand for 'Make America Great Again.'

On the day of the alleged attack, January 29, Smollett told police he had been returning to his Chicago residence when two unknown men shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him.

The actor claimed that the attackers went on to hit him, pour bleach over him and also put a noose around his neck.

Cory Booker (left) had previously called the assault a 'modern-day lynching' (tweet pictured right) but when asked to comment on the recent development said he would now wait for further information

Following the attack, two brothers of Nigerian-descent who were known to the actor, were arrested but were subsequently released without charge.

TMZ cites anonymous production sources who say that the 36-year-old had nine key scenes in the new string of episodes of the Fox show and one big musical.

But in the wake of allegations he staged his racist and homophobic attack, producers have scaled back his appearance in the fifth season of Empire.

Sources say five of his scenes and a musical have been cut entirely and he will no longer be the focus for his remaining four.

The sudden revision means extra work for the writers and the script has reportedly undergone multiple revisions in the past 24 hours.

Empire is in its fifth season. It last aired on December 5 and is due to return to screens in the spring but a date for the 10th episode of the season has not yet been announced. The final episodes are still being filmed.

Smollett is now required on set far less, according to the report, though the sources would not say if his role would be entirely written out.

He plays Jamal Lyon, one of the son's Terrance Howard's musical mogul character's sons.

Jussie Smollett's scenes in the new episodes of Empire that are set to air in the spring have been reduced, according to sources

Smollett, shown on set, plays Jamal Lyon, the middle son of Terrance Howard's hip hop mogul character and his wife, Cookie, who is played by Taraji Henson. They are shown with Bryshere Gray who plays Jussie's on-screen brother, Hakeem

A representative for Fox, which owns the show, declined to comment on Tuesday.

They also refused to comment on Monday when asked if Jussie's role had been affected by the latest developments in the shocking and unpredictable case.

On Monday, it was reported that the star may now face felony charges for filling a false police report about the January 29 attack he says he suffered and which shocked the world.

Smollett, who strenuously denies lying and maintains he was the victim of a heinous, homophobic and racist ambush, is due to speak to investigators again and his team of attorneys says he is cooperating fully.

Two Nigerian-descent brothers who were brought in for questioning about the attack last week were released without charge after allegedly telling investigators that Smollett, who knew them, paid them to do it and told them to buy the rope he said was placed around his neck.

Brothers Abel and Ola Osunadairo were released without charge last week after allegedly telling police Smollett paid them to perform the attack

The brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, released a statement on Monday to say they were 'not homophobic, not racist and not anti-Trump' but they are yet to say anything else.

After DailyMail.com revealed that it was them who had been taken in to be questioned and that the pair knew Smollett and had even trained in his gym, the actor released a statement to say he found it 'impossible' that they could somehow have been involved.

The incident occurred at 2am on January 29 as Smollett was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop.

He had not long returned to Chicago from New York on an hours-long delayed flight which he documented on social media in live time.

Smollett told police he was attacked as he walked home from a Subway at 2am on January 29

This is the letter Smollett allegedly received at the Fox studio, a week before the January 29 incident

He had been in New York to participate in a reading of a play about a gay baseball player who suffers a similarly homophobic attack to the one he later described to police.

In a tearful interview on Good Morning America last week, he wept as he said he was telling the truth and was hopeful that surveillance camera footage of the attack would soon be found to quieten his doubters.

Police sources cited by CBS and ABC but that have not yet been confirmed have suggested he made up the attack because he wanted more publicity, either because he feared he was being written out of the show or because a threatening letter he claimed to receive a week earlier did not get enough attention.

The police department will give out no details on the record."

The perfect example of this, according to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, is the ironic career of Al Sharpton.

In a monologue Monday evening on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” the host rightly noted that Sharpton, a former street hustler turned Democrat Party policy adviser and veritable Democrat TV “news” host, has never been held accountable for the hate crime hoax he helped perpetrate 31 years ago.

Listen:

“In 1987, Al Sharpton introduced the media to a young woman called Tawana Brawley. Brawley had an awful story to tell. She said she’d been viciously raped by a group of racist white man and left in a garbage bag. She was covered in feces with racial slurs scrawled on her body,” he said.

“The Brawley case dominated headlines across the country for more than a year, and it bitterly divided New York City along ethnic lines. People hated each other because of what Tawana Brawley said happened to her. But it was all a lie.”

In October of 1988, and after conducting hundreds of interviews, a grand jury concluded that the rape never happened — that Brawley had manufactured all of it after she ran away from home so as to avoid being punished by her stepfather, Ralph King.

“That should’ve been the end of Al Sharpton’s career, yet just the opposite happened,” Carlson continued, explaining that the now-wealthy race hustler went on to run for president, advise former President Barack Hussein Obama and even obtain his own “news” program on MSNBC.

“Sharpton has never apologized or even acknowledged the harm he did to this country by lying about Tawana Broadley. No one has forced him to. The lesson of Al Sharpton was clear to everyone watching: There are no penalties for hate hoaxes. There are only rewards.”

Enter Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett, the latest in a long line of hate crime hoaxers who’ve attempted to exploit racial tensions in America for some sort of personal gain.

Smollett claimed in late January that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931.

According to TMZ, Smollett also claimed that the suspect was white. The dubious description of the alleged attack provided to local authorities by him led the left to assume the perpetrators were racist white supporters of President Donald Trump and that Trump was therefore to blame.

It has since been learned — though not quite yet proven indefinitely — that the actor allegedly staged the attack with the help of two Nigerian actors whom he’d hired.

“Will anybody be held accountable for this? Don’t bet on it,” Carlson asserted.

If anything, hate crime hoaxes have been occurring more and more frequently ever since the election of President Donald Trump, whom the left falsely claim is a racist white supremacist.

Only weeks after the president’s election in 2016, a Muslim woman filed a police report claiming she’d been harassed on a New York City subway by hate-spewing Trump supporters. That was a lie.

The following year the media blamed Trump after a hash of bomb threats were issued against various synagogues and Jewish schools. That turned out to be a false narrative.

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

Last year the media again blamed Trump when a suspect vandalized a New York synagogue. It was later learned that the suspect was a deranged Democrat activist.

And just last month the media ran with a false narrative about an American Indian who’d allegedly been harassed by a group of Trump-supporting teenager boys. That too was a lie.

“The much-hyped epidemic of hate crimes you’ve heard so much about essentially is made up,” Carlson pointed out. “The premise is absurd. America is not a hateful country. It’s the most welcoming place on Earth. That’s why, even as our children learn from their teachers what a bigoted country this is, millions continue to stream in from Africa and Latin America for a better life here.”

“We are kind people. You see it in your own life. How many violent racists do you know? None probably. That is because there aren’t any in America. The left has to invent them,” the host concluded.

All while it ignores the real racism and bigotry perpetrated by its own members on a near-daily basis, as noted by social media:

The Left invent racism and discrimination where it does not exist to aggrandize themselves and ignores it where it actually does exist to protect their collective sense of ideological purity and we have to take lectures on morality from these two faced frauds?

Also, anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan praised both Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and leaders of the Women’s March and there’s almost no media outrage over it. And journalist Lara Logan lets the cat out of the bag on media bias, and a story on perhaps the most obnoxious bride in history.

Listen to the show:

The story around the bogus hate crime against actor Jussie Smollett just keeps getting weirder and weirder. Now reports are saying that he may have sent himself a threatening letter before the attack, and that the attack was because the public and media response wasn’t big enough for his liking. We break it all down.

Sen. Kamala Harris, who is running for president, immediately sent out a tweet after the initial reports of the Smollett attack calling it “an attempted modern-day lynching.” Now that the wheels have come off the story, Harris was asked if she regretted the tweet and she acted as though it was the first she’d ever heard of it. Actually, it probably was. It’s highly unlikely Harris runs her own Twitter account. It’s probably run by a “woke” staffer looking to get out in front of the field and ended up running off a cliff.

Noted racist and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan sang the praises for anti-Semitic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and the anti-Semitic women who co-founded the Women’s March and it created next to no outrage in the media. It’s quite a change from how the media treats David Duke and whatever statements he makes, which every Republican is asked to answer for. Republicans have denounced Duke for decades, Democrats have barely been asked to denounce Farrakhan, let alone willing to do so voluntarily.

Former 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan has some choice words for her profession — and very few of them were good. Speaking on a podcast, Logan admitted the bias in journalism and talked about how it’s much worse than we thought.

Plus, the a vegan bride uninvited her own mother and other family members from her wedding because they won’t pledge to go vegan for the rest of their lives. Yes, it’s that crazy of a story that you have to hear to believe.

Smollett has publicly expressed outrage at speculation that he may have set up the attack, including a lengthy interview with Good Morning America host Robin Roberts during which he called out “haters” who doubted his account of what happened.

Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until it’s completed.

Speaking Monday to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, during her first presidential campaign trip to the state, the U.S. senator from California says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” Police in Chicago say their investigation into the report that the actor was attacked by two men yelling slurs has “shifted” after two brothers were questioned and released. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The Presidents Day holiday weekend brought Harris and other Democratic presidential candidates to New Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020. Also campaigning in the Granite State were Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, campaigned in Iowa as well."

""The Daily Show"" host tries to make sense of the twisting story of an alleged attack against the ""Empire"" star that may yet prove to be an attack staged by the actor.

Unarguably, one of the most bizarre stories to emerge in the recent entertainment news cycle is the ongoing sordid tale of the alleged attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, but Trevor Noah thinks it just prove what a great talent he is.

Was Smollett attacked by two white men who shouted ""This is MAGA country"" as they threw racial and homophobic slurs at him, tossed a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him? Or was the whole thing a staged attack by Smollett? And why is Noah the first late-night host to tackle this sordid saga that's been unfolding for a while now?

The truth remains elusive at this time as police continue their investigation -- not into late-night television -- as covered extensively by TMZ. But ""The Daily Show"" host thinks there's one huge detail about Smollett's story that's been fishy from the start.

""Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch 'Empire'?"" Noah asked. ""I've heard of hate-watching but that shit would be next-level. That's like a member of the Klan buying tickets to 'Fiddler on the Roof.'""

The latest persons of interest in the case are two brothers from Nigeria with personal connections to Smollett. It is these guys, according to TMZ's reporting, who told police officers that Smollett staged the attack, and even rehearsed it beforehand.

""I'm not gonna lie, that's the one part of the story that actually makes sense to me, because if I was paying these two to beat me up, I would want to practice too,"" Noah said, throwing up a picture of the two ripped brothers. """"How many abs does this guy on the left have? It looks like he stole a couple of abs from the other guy.""

He went on to say, ""So in the public eye, this story has moved from a hate crime against a popular TV actor to a giant hoax by a popular TV actor, but Smollett still insists there was 'no collusion.'""

As it stands, it's a developing story, so Noah couldn't make any conclusions or speak definitively about any of the facts of the story. But he can response to Smollett's interview on ""Good Morning America"" shortly after the alleged attack where he tearfully asked what kind of person would make up something like this.

After watching the emotional clip. Noah said, ""Either this guy's telling the truth, or he deserves an Emmy for that interview, because if all of that is just a performance, I don't care what he's lying about, you can't cancel him. He's just too good to not be on TV.""

TMZ says that's already starting to happen, though. According to their sources, Smollett's role in the next episode to be filmed has been slashed dramatically as the show is being aggressively rewritten to reduce emphasis on his character.

The case is expected to go to a Grand Jury as early as today, per TMZ, and could see Smollett slapped with a felony indictment for filing a false police report.

""I don't know how it's going to end up, because every day the story just gets stranger and stranger,"" Noah said. ""Tomorrow we could find out that those Nigerian brothers are actually princes and they needed the money to unlock their royal inheritance.""

It was first deemed as a hate crime in late January.

Donald Trump, Jr. called out Instagram, on Monday asserting that the social media platform made him pull a post he made about reports that Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack might have been staged, although it subsequently restored it on his account. The post claimed the alleged offence against Smollett “seemed so real.”

“Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a [rich] guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees, because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless,” he posted, rounding off the comment with three eye-roll smileys.

Some time later, the president’s son commented on Hollywood actors reportedly deleting their earlier posts that called for justice to be served for the “Empire” actor following his supposed assault, after reports started to come in claiming that Smollett might have staged the attack himself.

“Speaks for itself. I hope @Instagram won't [sic] arbitrarily choose to censor this one,” Trump Jr. shared online.

A spokesperson for Instagram apologized for removing the post Monday, telling the Daily Caller that it was removed “in error,” with the post being finally restored. However, it remains unclear why the post was flagged in the first place.

The news, meanwhile, didn’t come as a surprise for netizens.

“Instagram is owned by the same people as Facebook…major censorship of everyone labelled as 'conservative'…,” one posted, with another one echoing the same stance:

“Funny how it's always an error against a Republican. This literally NEVER happens to a liberal.”

Hilarious memes and gif-images about Instagram’s possible bias also arrived in huge numbers:

“No bias at all” a different commenter claimed, tongue-in-cheek.

No bias at all😂😂😂 — 6️⃣ (@VanillaJordan) 19 февраля 2019 г.

Another immediately recalled the much debated US mainstream media’s bias, along with that of Facebook:

Bad week for the main stream media already — Robbie (@weeeelolol) 19 февраля 2019 г.

More like ""oops, we got caught showing our TDS."" — cslimfu (@cslimfu) 19 февраля 2019 г.

Some ""conspiracy theories"" like any theory may (eventually) be proven true. Who do these tech giants think they are to censor a theory? They should be as critical of MSM, who push #FakeNews on a regular basis! — Donna (@ScarletLetterA4) 19 февраля 2019 г.

Actor Jussie Smollett, who is black and openly gay, was rushed to hospital on 29 January after what was first investigated as a hate crime. He told reporters he was attacked by two masked perpetrators who yelled, ""Aren't you that f****t 'Empire' n*****?"" before attacking him, placing a rope around his neck and thrown a chemical — supposedly bleach — on him.

Before walking away, they reportedly yelled ""This is MAGA country"", which hit a raw nerve with the general public at the time. However, days after that, CNN cited police sources familiar with the case as saying that Chicago’s law enforcement believe Smollett in actual fact paid the two men to set up the assault.

A similar controversy arose just recently, after GOP spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany likewise faced censorship on Instagram, as she was asked to remove a post about Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s claims to Native American heritage.

McEnany’s post contained a copy of Warren’s Texas Bar registration in which she identified herself as an American Indian, which was flagged by Instagram as “including the home address of someone else”, which is strictly prohibited on the social network. After it was discovered that the location in question was an office address and not a personal home address, the content was restored and the mistake prompted an apology from Instagram’s mods."

Empire’ writers are reportedly busy making edits in the original script, which scheduled Smollett for nine scenes and a big musical number, according to TMZ.

The medium further reported that Jussie’s character, “Jamal, was originally scheduled to appear in nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode but this would no longer be the case.

“The episodes which are currently being shot will see Jamal appearing in four scenes and his musical number has been taken out of the plot.

“It was also reported that Smollett will no longer be the main focus in the remaining four scenes as he would be flanked by a number of cast members.

“To this end, Jussie will be spending way less time on set without rehearsal,’’ it said.

It was also reported that Smollett, who plays the role of ‘Jamal Lyon’ in ‘Empire,’ will enjoy less screen time.

This move, TMZ reports, is in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the widely reported attack on him.

Smollett was assaulted in Chicago by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slur at him.

Smollett told police that he had just landed in town from New York and was attacked as he stepped out to get a bite to eat at a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m.

On East North Lower Water Street, in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville.

Meanwhile there are reports that two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, might have been paid off by Smollett to stage the attack.

The brothers were arrested on February 13, 2019, in connection to the case.

They were picked up at the airport in Chicago after they arrived from Nigeria where they had gone to spend some time with their family.

Interestingly, the brothers have been released with no charges as the police revealed there is now new evidence.

Smollett has also vehemently denied paying the two brothers $3,500 to attack him.

His lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, disclosed to Entertainment Weekly that the star is now being victimised over the false allegations of him staging the incident.

Also, the reports added that one of the brothers was Smollett’s trainer for a music video.(NAN)"

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, told Entertainment Weekly: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

‘He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

His lawyers now say that one of men was Smollett’s personal trainer for a music video. They added: ‘One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

‘It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.’

The stunning turn of events saw the two men involved in the alleged hoax now fully cooperating with law enforcement, CNN reported Saturday.

On January 29, two men ‘yelled out racial and homophobic slurs’ while attacking Smollett, the actor told police.

One of the assailants tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, Smollett claimed at the time.

Kamala Harris seemed at a loss for words as she stammered over herself while calling for caution going forward.

“Which tweet? What tweet?” she first replied in confusion as a reporter asked her about what she wrote on Twitter late last month after Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett claimed that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

As the reporter described the tweet to Harris, she looked around in complete confusion.

“Um, ah, ah, uh, okay, so I will say this about that case, I think the facts are still unfolding and um, I’m very, um, concerned,” she replied. “And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation.”

“And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.”

Watch some of her reply below:

Social media users were quick to note how this sudden desire to withhold judgement until the facts become clear contrasts with the way she first responded late last month.

One Twitter user also noted the similarity between the senator’s rush to judgment in the Jussie Smollett case and her rush to judgment during the hijacked confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose since-debunked accuser she believed without question.

“[I]t’s funny how you withhold judgment on this phony actor but not judge Kavanaugh though right? Racist and bigotry at its finest,” the social media user wrote.

Look at this and other tweets below:

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

To many it seems like Harris and her peers, including fellow Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, invariably rush to judgment whenever the purported facts fit their narrative that America is a racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic, evil country full of bad people.

Note what she had to say about the Smollett hoax during an interview Monday with New Hampshire news station WMUR. Instead of answering the question, she spoke of the anti-lynching bill that she successfully pushed through the GOP-led Congress last year.

“Well, I think the facts are still kind of rolling themselves out, so I don’t actually know what happened. But I will say that I’m very proud that finally, the United States Congress and the United States Senate, after 200 years passed legislation that acknowledges that lynching is a crime and should be punishable as such. As a career prosecutor, I’ve personally prosecuted a variety of violent crimes, including homicides. Lynching is part of a real dark stain on America’s history,” she said.

Listen:

While there’s nothing wrong with the lynching bill, it needs to be kept in mind that the last lynching in the United States occurred nearly four decades ago. But to those among the left like Harris who buy into the narrative of an evil nation, the America of the past is no different than the America of today.

Never mind that America of today elected Barack Hussein Obama, a black man, to the highest office roughly one decade ago, and Harris, a black woman, to the Senate two years ago …

And never mind that contemporary America is so lacking in racism and homophobia that Smollett had to hire two Nigerian brothers to make it seem otherwise, as noted by social media:

ABC(CHICAGO) — The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett claim they helped him concoct the assault after he became upset that a now-suspicious letter threatening him, sent to Empire‘s studio, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News on Monday.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo also told investigators that Smollett paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the January 29 attack that he said occurred near his Chicago apartment, sources said.

A letter threatening Smollett was sent January 22 to the studio in Chicago where Empire is filmed, police said. The letter contained threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

Detectives are actively investigating the account of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, but thus far police have not independently verified the allegations, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News.

The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope — allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs — at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.

Smollett also claimed the attackers shouted “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” Osundairo brothers said in a statement to CBS Chicago affiliate WBBM which has been confirmed by ABC News.

Detectives have now shifted the investigation towards determining whether Smollett made up the entire story, sources said.

A source told CBS Chicago, ""when the letter didn't get enough attention, [Smollett] concocted the staged attack.""



Pointedly, police in Chicago have stopped calling Smollett a victim and now refer to him as ""the individual who reported the incident."" CBS News has learned two brothers have admitted to helping fake the incident, and that the actor himself paid them to do it.

When police raided the home of brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo last week, one of the items seized was a magazine. That's notable because the week before Smollett said he was beaten by two masked, race-baiting homophobes who yelled ""this is MAGA country,"" the ""Empire"" star received a threatening letter at the Chicago studios where his show is filmed. The words appeared to be spelled out with letters clipped from a magazine.

""So the question I ask as a prosecutor, 'What is the motive of the brothers to do any of this. Why would they do this?'"" said CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman.

Multiple sources told CBS Chicago Smollett was upset the letter didn't get a ""bigger reaction,"" and decided to orchestrate the attack. Investigators have requested a follow-up interview with Smollett, who has repeatedly denied faking the attack.

Smollett's lawyers said he knows the brothers, one of whom was his personal trainer. In a video posted on Facebook last month, Abel Osundairo, a bodybuilder, practiced posing to one of Smollett's songs. Ola Osundairo appeared in the second season of ""Empire.""

The men told CBS Chicago ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Chicago police have very publicly requested another interview with Smollett because of all the new information they have gathered in the last week, much of it undermining the actor's version of what he says happened to him three weeks ago."

The actor was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode, which is presently being shot.

However, 5 of those scenes have been cut and his musical number has been 86’d, production sources tell TMZ.

Also, Jussie Smollett will no longer be the focus of the remaining four scenes.

With his duties cut down, Smollet will be spending way less time on set.

Instead of working every day this week, sources say Smollet will only be working on Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

Producers on the show are apparently circling the wagons following CBS Chicago’s bombshell report that Smollett allegedly paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the assault. The men claimed the actor told them to buy the rope and that he paid for it, the report said. Smollett and the brothers even rehearsed the incident, they allegedly told police.

Production sources now tell TMZ that Smollett, who was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the penultimate episode of Empire, has seen five of his scenes cut and the song excised completely in furious rewrites.

Smollett alleged that he was attacked after he went to a Subway restaurant early in the morning of Jan. 29.

In an interview with ABC’s Good Morning America broadcast last Thursday, he said, “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

However, holes emerged in Smollett’s story.

It turned out that the two brothers who were picked up by cops, Ola and Abel Osundairo, knew Smollett, and Ola had previously appeared as an extra on Empire. They have allegedly admitted they were paid $3,500 to stage the attack.

The brothers told officials Smollett paid them the money before they briefly fled to Nigeria after the attack took place and the actor promised them an additional $500 upon their return, according to CBS Chicago.

And now a source tells CBS News that Smollett is suspected of staging the attack after being upset about a threatening racist letter, made of cutout print and sent to the show’s studio, which also depicted a man with a rope around his neck, didn’t get a “bigger reaction.”

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS investigative reporter Brad Edwards. CBS said other sources corroborated that information.

The Osundairo brothers told CBS: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

TMZ reports the case is heading to a grand jury as early as Tuesday with the focus on a potential felony indictment against Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report."

He added that being famous didn’t make things any easier.

“Even if you got money, it ain’t easy. It ain’t no favoritism, and I respect it, I honestly respect it. It would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants, I think,” he said.

Most of them occurred in the immediate aftermath of the election. And all of them have been debunked. Just a little more evidence of how far the left is willing to go to discredit Trump.

Here is a summary of Hasson’s list:

1. Shortly after the election, a Muslim student at the University of Michigan reported that an intoxicated man threatened to light her on fire if she refused to remove her hijab.

2. Openly bisexual North Park University student Taylor Volk reported that, since the election, she had been receiving hateful notes and emails. She told NBC News “I just want them to stop.”

3. “A Philadelphia woman, Ashley Boyer, said she had been harassed at a gas station by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. Boyer claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.”…Local police debunked her account.”

4. An 18-year-old Louisiana woman, a Muslim, claimed two white men attacked her and stole her wallet and her hijab. One of the men, of course, had been wearing a “MAGA” hat.

5. “A church organist was arrested in May 2017 after he was found responsible for spray-painting a swastika, an anti-gay slur and the words “Heil Trump” on his own church in November 2016.” It should surprise no one that the Washington Post reported, “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win.”

6. Yasmin Seweid, a Muslim New Yorker, claimed she had been attacked on the subway by several Trump supporters. She also said that onlookers did not help her.

7. A Texas man, David Williams, set his own car on fire and painted “n***** lovers” on his home’s garage. He and his wife also collected $5,000 via GoFundMe.

8. “A prankster sent Mic.com writer Sarah Harvard a fictitious story in which a Native American claimed to have been harassed by an alleged Trump supporter who thought she was Mexican. Despite no evidence backing up the claim, Harvard spread the fake story, emails the prankster shared with The Daily Caller showed.”

9. A Beloit College student, a Muslim, wrote anti-Muslim words on the door of his dorm room.

10. A US-Israeli man was found responsible for a string of bomb threats targeting synagogues and Jewish schools. A former reporter for The Intercept was also charged with making several copycat threats.

11. A black St. Olaf College (MN) student left a series of racist notes targeting black students around the campus.

11. In September 2017, “horrific racist notes were found at the Air Force Academy’s preparatory school. “Go home n***er,” read one of the notes. The superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, went viral with an impassioned speech addressing the racist notes…Two months later, authorities determined that one of the students targeted by the notes was also the person responsible for writing them.”

12. A black Kansas State University student claimed that racist graffiti, such as “Go Home N***** Boy” and “Whites Only,” had been written on his car.

13. Racial slurs were written on a bathroom mirror in a Missouri high school. The perpetrator was “non-white.”

14. A Texas waiter Khalil Cavil posted a photo of a racist note on Facebook which “he claimed a customer had left on the receipt. The note described Cavil as a “terrorist.” Saltgrass Steak House, where Cavil worked, initially banned the customers for life, before their investigation revealed that the waiter had faked the racist note. “I did write it,” Cavil later admitted. “I don’t have an explanation. I made a mistake. There is no excuse for what I did.”

15. A Drake University student claimed he had received racist notes. It turned out he had written the notes himself.

Hasson cites other examples as well which can be read here.

All of these cases were covered by breathless reporters who couldn’t wait for another opportunity to bash Trump. Each report triggered new cries of outrage from the left. Once the crimes were debunked, however, there was silence.

We can only wonder how many hoax crimes have not been exposed."

CHICAGO -- Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx has recused herself from the investigation surrounding the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, her office told ABC News on Tuesday.""Out of an abundance of caution, the decision to recuse herself was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case,"" a spokeswoman told ABC News via email.First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats will act as the state's attorney for this matter, a spokeswoman for Foxx's office said.Former Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez criticized Foxx in a Facebook post Wednesday:""Maybe I should have just recused myself from the difficult cases that came across my desk when I was State's Attorney. I was under the impression that when the voters elected me and I took my oath of office it meant I had to do my job.""Alvarez lost the March 2016 Democratic primary to Foxx, after fallout from the Laquan McDonald shooting investigation.20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment issued this statement Wednesday: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Earlier Tuesday, a tip that Smollett was seen on the night of his attack with two brothers who were arrested and later released without charges was deemed ""unfounded"" by Chicago police, according to CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.Smollett reported in January that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood.An unknown person who lived in Smollett's building or was visiting a resident of the building reported seeing the three men together in an elevator in the building on the night in question, Guglielmi said.The tip was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives, Guglielmi tweeted Tuesday evening.Hours earlier, the brothers and their lawyer were seen at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. The attorney was seen leaving about 3:45 p.m. without comment. Chicago police told ABC News that the brothers met with prosecutors and police but did not testify before a grand jury Tuesday.On Monday, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News that the brothers told police that Smollett staged the attack on himself because he was upset a threatening letter he received a week prior did not get enough attention.Detectives are actively investigating the allegation, but have not confirmed it to be true, the official said.Chicago police said this weekend that they are ""eager"" to re-interview Smollett after releasing the two brothers, who were initially identified as persons of interest in the alleged attack. A spokeswoman for Smollett said his attorneys are talking to police.The brothers, who are not considered suspects in the attack, also told police that they were paid to stage the attack, the official said.""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,"" the brothers said in a statement.The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the letter, which was sent to the Chicago studio for ""Empire"" on Jan. 22, and whether Smollett played a role in sending the letter, two federal officials confirmed to ABC News. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, according to one of those sources.Last week, Smollett sat down with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts and spoke about the letter.""Just because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said, 'Smollett, Jussie, you will die, black (expletive),'"" Smollett said. ""There was no address, but the return address said in big, red, you know, like caps, 'MAGA.' Did I make that up too?""After the police department investigated Smollett's attack for weeks as a possible hate crime, they discovered that one of the brothers bought the rope to be used in the attack at a local hardware store. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the store was the Crafty Beaver hardware store in Ravenswood.Late Saturday, Smollett's attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement, addressing reports that the actor may have staged the attack.A CPD spokesman said Sunday, ""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""ABC7 Eyewitness News also learned Tuesday that Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement in Los Angeles in 2007. He was sentenced to two years of probation and either spent three days in jail or paid a fine of $100 for the three misdemeanor charges, according to the LA city attorney's office, though it's unclear which option he chose.If convicted of filing false police report, which is a felony in Illinois, Smollett could face up to three years in prison.Also Tuesday, a group of mothers who lost their sons to violence and whose cases remain unsolved gathered to speak out about the amount of resources dedicated to the Smollett case rather than their sons' unsolved cases.""I'm just calling on Chicago police today to listen to our words and listen to what we are talking about today,"" said Sheila Rush, whose son was murdered.

And that’s certainly the case for some Democratic presidential hopefuls as twists continue to emerge in the case of the alleged attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

When initial reports of the alleged incident surfaced three weeks ago, the actor said he was viciously attacked on the streets of Chicago. Reports stated that Smollett said there were two perpetrators, each wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats and shouting ""This is MAGA country"" during the alleged assault. Smollett later refuted he made such a claim to police during an interview with ""Good Morning America.""

Kamala Harris, considered the early front-runner among declared candidates, was quick to condemn the alleged attack.

“.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” Harris tweeted on January 29.

“This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S LAWYERS DENY HE PLANNED ATTACK AFTER CHICAGO POLICE CLAIM HE'S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A VICTIM IN CASE

However, the California Dem was caught off guard Monday when asked about the latest developments in the case that has seen Chicago police pour cold water on Smollett’s more explosive claims.

During an appearance at a bookstore in Concord, N.H., a female reporter asked the senator from California if she wanted to amend a tweet from Jan. 29, in which she said Smollett was the victim of ""an attempted modern day lynching"" and called the actor ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" Harris also has used the Smollett attack to push legislation that would make lynching a federal hate crime.

""Which tweet? What tweet?"" Harris asked. As the reporter specified the tweet in question, Harris appeared to look around for a campaign staffer before responding.

""OK, so, I will say this about that case,"" she said. ""I think that the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um, concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened.

CORY BOOKER 'WITHHOLDING' JUDGMENT ON SMOLLETT CASE AFTER CALLING IT 'ATTEMPTED MODERN-DAY LYNCHING'

""And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,"" Harris added. ""And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.""

Cory Booker also slammed the perpetrators of a crime the “Empire” star claimed was fueled by racial and anti-LGBT prejudice.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe,” Booker tweeted on January 29.

“To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime – I urge you to pay attention.”

ROBIN ROBERTS SAYS COPS FELT JUSSIE SMOLLETT WAS CREDIBLE AT TIME OF INTERVIEW

Booker, when asked about it again on Sunday, told reporters he would ""withhold"" judgment on the matter ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Other 2020 Dems forced to walk back strong early criticisms include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who initially responded to reports by calling it a “sickening and outrageous attack.”

“This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it. Praying for Jussie and his family,” she tweeted on January 29.

And while not a 2020 candidate, Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also forced to backpedal on Monday, deleting a sympathetic tweet she posted on January 29.

“The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all,” Pelosi wrote at the time.

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Maxine Waters, D-Calif., were also both highly critical of the alleged attack when reports first surfaced.

The change in tune came after a Chicago police spokesperson said over the weekend the ""trajectory of the investigation"" shifted and they no longer consider Smollett a victim in the case.

Meanwhile, Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, are vehemently denying that the attack was a hoax.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the lawyers said in a weekend statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Now, that story is coming completely apart, with police sources saying Smollett likely orchestrated the entire attack himself. But while we wait for the facts to come to light, it is worth remembering that almost 3,000 people were shot in the City of Chicago last year -- women, small children -- sometimes alone and sometimes in groups. Many hundreds of them died, and not a single one received anything like the attention the media has lavished on a relatively minor assault alleged by Smollett.

On the other hand, none of Chicago's 3,000 shootings were even half as useful as Smollett's story.

AL SHARPTON SAYS JUSSIE SMOLLETT SHOULD 'FACE ACCOUNTABILITY' IF ATTACK WAS A HOAX

The Smollett story had everything for a national media that long ago gave up the pretense of gathering news. Journalism is now explicitly a political job, the point of which is to enforce cultural orthodoxies and punish enemies.

Jussie Smollett was the perfect vehicle for both of those things.

Journalists pretended to be horrified as they recounted what he said happened to him, but secretly, they were thrilled.

“There are many indications of a hate crime here. They are looking for two suspects who were wearing apparently wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats though that has not yet been officially confirmed,” said MSNBC National Correspondent Miguel Almaguer.

Liz Plank, host of Vox Media’s “Consider It,” just knew President Trump had something to do with the attack.

“We don't know what happened to Jussie, but what we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country,” Plank said. “There is real evidence of people who have done these crimes, who cite that the President has inspired them.”

Jonathan Capehart, of the Washington Post, agreed with Plank. President Trump was most certainly to blame.

“The fact that [the attackers] reportedly said, ‘This is MAGA country,’ adds to sort of the atmosphere of menace that African-Americans in particular and people of color in general have felt since the advent of the Trump administration,"" Capehart mused.

POLITICIANS WHO JUMPED ON JUSSIE SMOLLETT ATTACK CLAIM IN AWKWARD SPOT

Finally, there was this observation from CNN’s Brooke Baldwin: “He said his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. This is America in 2019.”

Oh, and if you had questions, much less doubts, the elites were poised to attack you.

“And the media has really cast so much doubt on his story which I find so personally offensive that a gay black man is targeted and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's disbelief,” said actress Sara Gilbert. “It is so outrageous to me.”

To the national media, Smollett's story was the perfect metaphor for the Trump era. It was also pretty clearly a total crock. Smollett's account began to fall apart within hours after a series of leaks from the obviously skeptical Chicago Police Department.

His handlers paired him with a network anchor they could rely on, with a 16-minute interview with Robin Roberts of ""Good Morning, America."" Roberts surely knew there was ample evidence that Smollett was lying, but she decided to ignore that. Instead, Roberts colluded with him.

She nodded empathetically as Smollett wept on camera. She asked no significant follow-up questions. The two parted like old friends. Both Smollett and Roberts turned out to be talented actors. Check out their performance on YouTube before it is scrubbed. You will never watch ABC News again. Virtually every word they utter is dishonest.

“If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” Smollett told Roberts. “The fact that we have these fear mongers, these people that are trying to separate us and it is just not okay.”

Who is dividing us? And who exactly is the victim in all of this? While Smollett claims that he is the victim, he tells us that he represents the most despised and unfashionable groups in America, that is why bigots doubt his story. The rest of us nod as if this was true because we are required to do that. That is how dishonest our society has become. Everyone must lie all the time. We know the rules, we have no choice.

The fact is, the much-hyped epidemic of hate crimes we have heard so much about essentially is made up. The premise is absurd. America is not a hateful country, it is the most welcoming place on Earth that is why even as our children learn from their teachers what a bigoted country this is, millions continue to stream in from Africa and Latin America for a better life here.

So why does the left insist on inventing bigoted bogeymen waiting around every dark corner? Maybe because stoking race hatred ensures continued power for the Democratic Party. Divided populations are easier to manipulate and rule. There would be no Democratic coalition without racial animosity. It is what holds their constituencies together. That is the point of identity politics. It is why they are forever reopening the wound.

But the cost to the country has been high. Hate hoaxes make ethnic groups fear and distrust each other. That is a dangerous thing to do in a country that is becoming more diverse by the day.

I was under the impression that when the voters elected me and I took my oath of office it meant I had to do my job.""Alvarez lost the March 2016 Democratic primary to Foxx, after fallout from the Laquan McDonald shooting investigation.20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment issued this statement Wednesday: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""Earlier Tuesday, a tip that Smollett was seen on the night of his attack with two brothers who were arrested and later released without charges was deemed ""unfounded"" by Chicago police, according to CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.Smollett reported in January that he was attacked by two masked men who hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him and looped a rope around his neck in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood.An unknown person who lived in Smollett's building or was visiting a resident of the building reported seeing the three men together in an elevator in the building on the night in question, Guglielmi said.The tip was not supported by video evidence obtained by detectives, Guglielmi tweeted Tuesday evening.Hours earlier, the brothers and their lawyer were seen at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. The attorney was seen leaving about 3:45 p.m. without comment. Chicago police told ABC News that the brothers met with prosecutors and police but did not testify before a grand jury Tuesday.On Monday, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News that the brothers told police that Smollett staged the attack on himself because he was upset a threatening letter he received a week prior did not get enough attention.Detectives are actively investigating the allegation, but have not confirmed it to be true, the official said.Chicago police said this weekend that they are ""eager"" to re-interview Smollett after releasing the two brothers, who were initially identified as persons of interest in the alleged attack. A spokeswoman for Smollett said his attorneys are talking to police.The brothers, who are not considered suspects in the attack, also told police that they were paid to stage the attack, the official said.""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,"" the brothers said in a statement.The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the letter, which was sent to the Chicago studio for ""Empire"" on Jan. 22, and whether Smollett played a role in sending the letter, two federal officials confirmed to ABC News. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, according to one of those sources.Last week, Smollett sat down with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts and spoke about the letter.""Just because on the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said, 'Smollett, Jussie, you will die, black (expletive),'"" Smollett said. ""There was no address, but the return address said in big, red, you know, like caps, 'MAGA.' Did I make that up too?""After the police department investigated Smollett's attack for weeks as a possible hate crime, they discovered that one of the brothers bought the rope to be used in the attack at a local hardware store. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the store was the Crafty Beaver hardware store in Ravenswood.Late Saturday, Smollett's attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement, addressing reports that the actor may have staged the attack.A CPD spokesman said Sunday, ""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""ABC7 Eyewitness News also learned Tuesday that Smollett pleaded no contest to DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to law enforcement in Los Angeles in 2007. He was sentenced to two years of probation and either spent three days in jail or paid a fine of $100 for the three misdemeanor charges, according to the LA city attorney's office, though it's unclear which option he chose.If convicted of filing false police report, which is a felony in Illinois, Smollett could face up to three years in prison.Also Tuesday, a group of mothers who lost their sons to violence and whose cases remain unsolved gathered to speak out about the amount of resources dedicated to the Smollett case rather than their sons' unsolved cases.""I'm just calling on Chicago police today to listen to our words and listen to what we are talking about today,"" said Sheila Rush, whose son was murdered.

Over the weekend, the Chicago Police Department released two suspects who were allegedly caught on surveillance video camera on that dreadful night of January 29 when “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked with bleach and a rope.

Investigators have been trying to work with Smollett but have had some roadblocks; he would not provide his cell phone to the detectives, for example.

Now, the Chicago Police Department has removed the title “victim” from their notes about Smollett — and they want to interview him again.

One Los Angeles civil rights activist is angry.

As I have said on my radio show many times, Americans do not like liars.

They can forgive you if you offer a sincere apology — but they will not support you if they are made to look like fools.

That’s what Najee Ali felt like. And he wants justice done against Smollett, not only for black America but for the LGBTQ community.

A Los Angeles-based civil rights activist held a press conference Sunday, calling for the arrest of actor Jussie Smollett and saying he believes the “Empire” star lied about being a victim of a hate crime. Najee Ali, who is also the director of Project Islamic HOPE, said false claims make real incidents of racist attacks and homophobia easier to dismiss. “It’s a slap in the face. We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim … and we believe is a lie … certainly is an injustice to those true victims,” Ali said. “Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying.” (source: ABC7)

The attorneys for Smollett responded to the report with the following statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.

She started stuttering and stammering in response.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

Via the Free Beacon:

“Which tweet? What tweet?” Harris asked a reporter after one brought up the recent developments. “About saying that it is a modern day lynching,” the reporter said. Harris looked to her left for an unknown reason and laughed before facing the reporter again, who said, “Jussie Smollet.” “Um, uh, OK. So I will say this about that case,” Harris said. “I think the facts are unfolding, and I’m very concerned about obviously [inaudible],” she said. The Fox News broadcast cut out the audio before she finished her sentence.

As I noted earlier today, Democrats used the Smollett case to expand federal hate crime laws by getting a bill passed to make “lynching” a federal hate crime.



Everyday Democrats project their own corruption onto President Trump, yet the facts reveal how dangerous the Democratic party has become. Owen Shroyer tackles the future for a party so comfortable with lies and hate.

Mumford wrote in a column titled, “I doubted Jussie Smollett. It breaks my heart that I might be right” (HT: The Gateway Pundit):

On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the openly gay heir to the show’s hip-hop record label throne, was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime. He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from “Empire,” then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout “this is MAGA country,” pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck. The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on “Empire,” about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defense attorney. […] I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fiber of my being, most of all because the consequences if he were lying were almost too awful to contemplate.

Indeed, it would mean there’s so little “hatred” and “racism” in this country that an openly gay black man living in a well-off, major city has to pay actors to stage a hate crime against himself just to push the narrative.

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed “police sources” have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

Najee Ali, a civil rights activist in Los Angeles, says Jussie Smollett could have started a race war with his allegation of a racially motivated attack. Owen Shroyer explains independent media helped bring out the facts about Jussie’s story before that could happen. If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of “fake news.”

Note: the damage these hoaxes have caused to run-of-the-mill Trump supporters and the hatred that’s been generated against them as a result is of no concern.

[…] And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting. This could be one tragedy that the Lyon family — and more importantly, the ordinary people who loved the show and invested in Smollett and his character — could never overcome.

Actually, hate hoaxes like these are exposed almost every month. An entire website has been created just to catalog them called FakeHateCrimes.org. The media just ignores them all and acts like nothing ever happened.

The Covington Catholic kids were lied about and demonized by your very own newspaper just a few weeks ago and after the hoax was exposed they still clung to the narrative and didn’t even bother to apologize.

From race, to environmentalism, to wealth, the gulf between ideological rhetoric and reality has rarely been wider.

Modern prophets often say one thing and do another. Worse, they often advocate in the abstract as a way of justifying their doing the opposite in the concrete.

The result is that contemporary culture abounds with the inexplicable — mostly because modern progressivism makes all sorts of race, class, and gender exceptions for politically incorrect felonies, an appeasement that ensures an absence of deterrence and thus even more transgressions.

Paradox No. 1: Merchants of Hate. We are told that white, racist young men are preying on people of color, obsessed with skin color (and gender), and emancipated by Donald Trump’s Klan-like MAGA army. In truth, the purveyors of such theories are themselves merchants of hate, who stereotype and demonize on the basis of skin color. And they do so, largely for anticipated career advantages, on the principle that supposed victims of white bigots can translate such ill treatment into publicity and, with it, attention and career enhancement. How did this epidemic of hate happen in 2019 America?

Answer: a) There are not enough racists left to fuel the current insatiable appetite of the anti-racism industry. So both victimizers and victims have to be invented — as we see with the Duke lacrosse lynching, the Virginia fraternity hoax, the Covington-kids invention, and the recent Jussie Smollett fraud. b) There are few punishments for fraud, but lots of rewards for being victimized, and so deterrence is lost and the merchants of hate assume they are free to invent what they please. c) Anything useful to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump is seen as a moral act, whether equating the Covington MAGA-hatted teenagers as veritable Klansmen or fitting out Smollett’s hired thugs with lynch rope and red hats.

Paradox No. 2: Green Filth. Ecology and environmentalism are supposedly efforts to prevent the natural world around from being spoiled by man and his modern-day lifestyle. Nowhere is green power stronger than in urban California. And yet nowhere are major cities (such as San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) dirtier, more dangerous, and more festering as a result of human indifference — or public policy.

Medieval plagues such as typhus and tuberculosis ravage street people in California cities, so much so that Los Angeles City Hall had to be deloused to ensure that it did suffer the flea-borne epidemics akin to those of Constantinople in the sixth century a.d. Feces, trash, urine, discarded needles, and rotting food scraps stain downtown streets; primeval carriers of disease such as rats and scavenging birds feast and defecate among the flotsam and jetsam.

Why the progressive tolerance for such environmental desecration in the age of the Green New Deal? Why would it be felonious to defecate on a Yosemite trail or leave a used hypo at a river bank in Yellowstone, while it’s condoned on Market Street in San Francisco where the potential for human injury is far greater?

Answer: a) Perhaps the primeval stink and disease are seen as organic and are therefore not a dreaded cause of global warming. b) Wealthy, urban people can navigate around the homeless with private security and chauffeured transportations, and by doing business away from hoi polloi. c) The ecological assault is the work of purported victims, not rich white males — a fact known to the homeless who know very well that they are exempt from the law that applies to the middle classes. d) Cleaning up the cities, ensuring modern hygiene, and dealing with the homeless would require lawmakers to make conservative and traditional choices and judgments about human nature — taboo in our relativist society.

Paradox No. 3: Hip Hate. Two of the great sins of the modern West are misogyny and racism. There is zero tolerance for both outrages. Even a sexist or racist word can destroy careers. Yet the most sexist and racist genres in the contemporary West are rap and hip-hop music. Rappers with a long history of racist, anti-Semitic, and misogynist lyrics (and occasional behavior) perform at the politically correct Super Bowl. Kendrick Lamar was for a while President Obama’s favorite singer and a guest at the White House, despite having made anti-police references and despite the abject racist imagery on a recent album cover. Yet rappers are rarely ostracized for objectifying women as “bitches and hos,” or police as pigs, or for railing against “the Jews.” How can a genre that is often pathological become so mainstream that it’s exempt from the rules of correct thought and language?

Advertisement

Answer: a) Contemporary dogma postulates that perceived victims cannot be victimizers, so any untoward language from rappers is a cry of the heart from the oppressed. b) Rap is a huge multibillion-dollar business whose icons can, with endorsements and advertising, ensure huge sales, often in markets in which particular consumers consider any criticism of rap as proof of racism. c) There is a wink-and-nod exemption such that mostly black rappers assume the public understands their conventions. Despite being worth hundreds of millions of dollars and living in gated estates, rap’s elite still need to sound “authentic.” Racism, anti-Semitism, and misogyny, like obscenity, ensure street cred. But such bias is winked off as a career necessity — a sort of genre convention like iambic pentameter or an opera performed in Italian.

Paradox No. 4. Bad Billions Are Good. Not since the late 19th century have we seen the emergence of such huge monopolies, trusts, and conglomerates, or the staggering fortunes made from them. By any standard progressive definition, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and an array of social-media and Internet companies ruthlessly warp their industries to gain monopolies; they gobble up threatening start-ups; they distort Internet searches; they censor conservatives; they dump product to ensure their market share; they stifle all dissent and are vindictive in going after dissidents and critics. And the result is that the largest unfettered fortunes in the history of capitalism are found in Silicon Valley and its spin-off industries elsewhere. Why has there not been any serious talk of monitoring multi-trillion-dollar industries based on monopolies and trusts that are controlling large chunks of Americans’ daily lives?

Answer: a) These are not 19th-century fortunes in oil, railroads, shipping, steel, or food production, whose buccaneer capitalists were for the most part supposedly odious conservative traditionalists. What Wall Street, communications, high-tech, and Internet zillionaires such as Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and the Google team have in common is that they are left-wing and put their fortunes to good progressive use. b) Conservatives still believe in unfettered free markets and therefore think it’s noble or at least permissible to allow their existential enemies on social media and the Internet to attack them with all the resources that cornering the market can bring. c) The masters of the new universe are hip. They are cool and don’t wear the usual suit and tie of the corporate elite. How can someone in flip-flops and torn jeans at the knees really know about thousands of their employees sleeping in their cars, or tech teams scheming to massage searches to produce politically correct results? Although Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Kamala Harris blast Big Tech money, we should not assume that they will turn away tech’s largesse or that they’re not beneficiaries of the biases of social media and the Internet.

Paradox No. 5: Blinkered Enlightenment. Progressive universities have consistently raised their tuition and room and board above the rate of inflation. They do not fully apprise grant and loan recipients of what precisely their compound-interest indebtedness will be once they graduate, much less what the average job market and compensation might be for particular majors. Teaching loads have been reduced for tenured faculty, while an increasingly large percentage of course units is offered by exploited part-time instructors who lack the job protections and the benefit compensation of regular faculty. Part-timers are the new braceros of the university, brought in for cheap labor without much of a care where they go or how they live after class. Free-speech quads on campus are about the most unfree areas in America, where the wrong ideology can earn ostracism and threats of bodily harm. Liberalism gave us Martin Luther King Jr.’s reminders of a racially blind society. Liberal universities superseded that idealism with the cynical reality that the color of one’s skin, not the content of one’s character, largely determines everything from admissions to graduation rates. Higher education still insists on standardized admissions tests (at least for some groups) and resists furiously similar exit exams to ensure that $300,000 worth of investments in education can be quantified by improved reading, reasoning, and computation. So why is the loudest progressive institution so regressive?

Advertisement

Answer: a) All left-wing projects by nature are hierarchical, in the sense that “people power” serves as proper cover for the material and egocentric ambitions of an elite, as exemplified by the Soviet dacha, the Cuba compound, the Venezuelan offshore account — and the compensation of “diversity czars” and those who get a lot of money for rarely teaching or researching but monitoring and auditing those who do. b) Higher education realizes that it will not be held accountable. It faces very little legal exposure for not educating its students, but a great deal of audit if it proves lax in terms of race, class, and gender activism. In other words, a university that turns out brilliant graduates is not as impressive as one that turns out woke grandees. c) College degrees are like sneaker or purse brands. They have increasingly little to do with authenticating knowledge and lots to do with opening careerist doors, improving class cachet, and maximizing power and influence. How is that possible? Largely because of admissions, not achievement. One is hired with a Harvard B.A. not because that four-year Cambridge stint proves he will excel as a writer, speaker, or thinker, but rather because it certifies that he once had excellent enough high-school grades and test scores (with noted exceptions) to get in. Ivy League admissions, not credentialing, is what employers look for — a fact known to cynical colleges and universities.

Paradox No. 6: Moral Amoral Immigration. By any definition, illegal immigration is amoral. Open borders penalize legal immigrants — who wait years under audit for green cards — in favor of those who cut in line and rush the border. Illegal immigration renders federal law a joke. Sanctuary cities are a neo-Confederate idea of state and local nullification of federal law. Unlawful entry punishes the law-abiding citizen, in driving down wages, and in de facto exempting of crimes such as felonious identity theft that would ruin the career of a U.S. citizen. To the U.S. citizen returning from abroad who presents a passport at customs, and who is hounded about whether he has food on his person, or too much cash, or undeclared purchases, illegal immigration delivers a message: You are an utter fool, and if you had just broken the law, you could have entered the U.S. with no audit at all. It is racist, in that it privileges Spanish speakers south of the border and treats them in a fashion not accorded to Eastern European, Australian, Japanese, or South Korean would-be immigrants. And illegal immigration is an affront to the poorer and lower middle classes, whose schools, neighborhoods, and safety are often compromised by the influx of millions who have not been audited in terms of health, criminality, and skills — all while illegal immigration and open borders are pushed by the upper middle classes and elite who by their power and money are exempt from such concerns. How did something so abjectly amoral come to be passed off as moral?

Advertisement

Answer: a) Vested interests are multifarious across the political spectrum. Latino activists want more political power and careers as the self-appointed spokesmen for a permanent (but revolving) underclass of Spanish speakers. Leftists want more states to flip blue as well as more voters who will be dependent on generous redistributionist bromides. Employers want cheap labor. Elites like inexpensive domestic help. Mexico wants a steady relief valve of social tension in lieu of domestic reform, a psychological getting even with the Yanquis, and a constant revenue stream of $30 billion in remittances, often subsidized by generous U.S. entitlements and welfare. b) So-called Third World poor are romanticized as noble — and useful. Were millions of middle-class conservative Poles, right-wing Chileans, or Taiwanese Reaganites swarming the border, we would build walls 30 feet high. c) Radical progressives often enjoy flux if not chaos, in the sense of disruptions to staid and reactionary U.S. customs and traditions. When 60 million U.S. residents are not native-born, good things accrue from disregarding the perceived norms of the English language, Christianity, American history, and the Constitution.

The common thread to the paradoxes that we encounter daily is the inconsistency of progressivism itself — or rather its ad hoc adoption of any means necessary to be justified by an anointed end, which is the quest for power and control. Progressivism is not an empirical or coherent creed, but contrary both to human nature and the record of history — in its arrogance that an elite, if only provided with enough money, power, and good intentions, can create heaven on earth rather than hell.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)

The Jussie Smollett debacle shows, yet again, that the media are more interested in pushing a left-wing agenda than sticking to facts.

This week, the story of the Jussie Smollett hoax gripped the national media. The story, for those who missed it, went something like this: The Empire actor, who is both black and gay, stated that on a freezing January night in Chicago, in the middle of the polar vortex, he went to a local Subway store to buy a sandwich. On his way back, he was accosted by two men wearing red hats who called him the f-word and the n-word. They then tossed a clothesline around his neck, poured bleach on him, and shouted, “This is MAGA country!”

There were some obvious problems with the story. First, Chicago is not exactly MAGA country — Trump won 12.5 percent of the vote in the city precincts. Second, it seems unlikely that people would stake out Smollett in the middle of the night in below-freezing temperatures. Third, Smollett somehow retained hold of his sandwich after the alleged assault. Fourth, he strolled through his apartment complex without notifying the doorman of the incident. Fifth, he waited 40 minutes to call the police. Sixth, when the police arrived, he was still wearing the clothesline around his neck. Seventh, Smollett claimed that his manager had been on the phone with him at the time of the alleged hate crime; when asked to turn over his phone to the Chicago Police Department to verify this, he refused to do so.

Initially, the media ran with the story without taking such questions seriously. The Washington Post’s Eugene Scott stated, “To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a ‘great America’ does not appear to include them.” Jamil Smith of Rolling Stone tweeted, “The brutal attack on him in Chicago appears to be yet another example not just of further moral decay, but of the brand of terrorism that still doesn’t seem to spark enough response by Americans.” CNN’s Brooke Baldwin simply lamented, “This is America in 2019.”

Celebrities weighed in, too. Actress Ellen Page went on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show where she blamed Vice President Mike Pence for the attack. Cher tweeted, “VILLAINY, RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA, PROMOTED BY MOST INFAMOUS [clown emoji] IN [world emoji], IS THE POISON THAT KILLS [American flag emoji].” Singer Katy Perry tweeted, “Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today . . . this is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country.” Director Rob Reiner added, “The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. . . . No intolerance! No DT!”

Then there were the Democratic politicians. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity.” Senator Cory Booker (D., N.J.), who is running for president, called the Smollett incident a “modern-day lynching.” Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed anyone willing to question Smollett’s account, stating, “The attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack.”

Why did so many on the political Left buy into the obviously incredible story from the moment that it broke? Because it perfectly fit narratives that the Left loves: the narrative of America as racist, homophobic hellhole; the narrative of Trump supporters as violent bigots; the narrative of Trump himself as an inspirational figure for such violent bigots. The story was too good to be true. So no one cared whether it was or not.

That phenomenon doesn’t exist only on the Left. Confirmation bias is a universal human concern. But in the past six months, we’ve seen the media run with uncorroborated, unverifiable accounts of sexual assault by Judge Brett Kavanaugh decades ago; false accounts of Trump-supporting high-schoolers harassing an elderly Native American man; and now the Smollett case. This isn’t a coincidence. The real message of the past few months is that the media are dominated by those who align with the political Left. That doesn’t mean that everything the media report is fake news. But it does mean that they themselves are too often fake newspeople. They’re actually motivated actors willing to put aside the strictures of journalistic objectivity in order to run with stories that back a preferred narrative. Then, when called on their bias, they run stories about conservatives “pouncing” — as though the story isn’t media bias itself but conservatives’ anger at media bias.

That’s absurd. But so was Smollett’s story from the outset. Either our media will learn to fact-check themselves, or they’ll continue to lose credibility. And either political partisans will learn to stick to the facts, or they’ll continue to tear the country apart on behalf of the narratives they prefer to truth.

Join the mob and support the ‘victim.’ Or the mob will come for you.

Jussie Smollett’s phony hate-crime story could have been taken apart in 24 hours, except for one thing: Nobody wanted to be the first to call bullsh**.

Who will bell the cat?

Not the police, and I don’t blame them. Smollett is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump who checks two protected-category boxes: He is gay and he is black. No police officer comes out ahead in any encounter in which he has to explain that he isn’t a racist or a gay-basher.

There isn’t much evidence that racist or homophobic attacks have increased in the Age of MAGA — partly because such episodes are so vanishingly rare in the United States that they are difficult to measure — but this is one of those things that everybody knows with such unshakable certainty that nobody really ever bothers to check. Imagine being the first cop to catch a whiff of baloney on Smollett’s tale of martyrdom.

Saying as much — especially in a city such as Chicago — would be to put one’s career on the line. Never mind what would happen if you were wrong about that — even being right but not right beyond all doubt would be professional suicide. For that matter, being unquestionably right but right too soon might have been just as bad.

Advertisement

Tell me you can’t hear it. “How dare you victimize him a second time! White privilege! Racist police!” Etc.

Advertisement

The same rhetorical strategy was deployed in the attempted character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh: merciless sympathy.

Merciless sympathy is the stratagem by which our natural solicitous feeling toward those who have suffered some wrong or some injury is forcibly reconstituted into support for a particular political agenda grafted onto the unhappy episode. Those who don’t support the politics are treated as though they were victimizing the victim (genuine or hoax) rather than disagreeing about a policy question.

Merciless sympathy is how declining to oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court is transmuted into callousness toward rape victims, how support for the Second Amendment is recast as contempt for the children killed in Parkland, how doubting the breathless accounts of the Covington Catholic matter becomes racist hostility to an elderly Native American veteran. As rhetorical stratagems go, it is obvious, shallow, and stupid — and therefore effective in the era of Twitter-dominated discourse, in which shallowness and stupidity are weaponized.

Advertisement

And so the police, journalists, and other professional askers of questions grow remarkably circumspect — some of the time. Compare the credulousness that greeted Smollett’s story to, e.g., Andrew Sullivan’s obsessive conspiracy-mongering about Sarah Palin’s son (remember the “Trig Truthers”) or the fact that Louise Mensch (of “marshal of the Supreme Court” infamy) was still welcome in the pages of the New York Times as late as March 2017. Smollett’s unverified and murky account was good enough for progressive journalists, but nothing Sarah Palin could say or do would satisfy their gimlet-eyed skepticism.

Advertisement

One might be forgiven for suspecting that there is an unspoken agenda at work in that double standard.

Merciless sympathy is simply one more weapon in the arsenal of contemporary mob politics. Brett Kavanaugh is an excellent jurist whose most controversial legal opinion is that the Constitution says what it says, which made opposing his confirmation difficult. So accuse him of being a serial rapist — and then accuse anybody who doubts your story of being in league with serial rapists at the expense of their victims.

We have seen this often enough.

The plague of phony hate crimes on college campuses, often coinciding with controversial political events, isn’t the product of coincidence. It is a strategy. Fictitious, politically charged stories of rape — Lena Dunham’s encounter with “Barry” the College Republican, the lies published by Rolling Stone, etc.—are not the products of coincidence. These things happen in clusters for a reason. That is not to say they are being centrally directed as part of some kind of well-tempered conspiracy, but rather that they are the natural result of a certain kind of politics attached to a certain worldview.

Merciless sympathy is used not only to silence doubters but to silence dissent. That is the purpose of conflating victims with political agendas. And if there aren’t any particularly useful victims around, you can always make something up.

Jussie Smollett wasn’t the first. He won’t be the last."

Legendary fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has died in Paris, France, at the age of 85.

Lagerfeld had been suffering from pancreatic cancer, and passed away on Tuesday after being rushed to hospital, a source said.

Spice Girl-turned-designer Victoria Beckham lead a host of tributes to the late fashion designer today, writing: 'So incredibly sad to hear this. Karl was a genius and always so kind and generous to me both personally and professionally. RIP'.

The German-born artistic director for Chanel had looked increasingly frail in recent months, and had did not come out to take a bow at Chanel's couture show in Paris in January, something the company attributed to him being 'too tired'.

'He hadn't gone on about his illness, but battled it very bravely,' said one source. 'Karl was very proud of his fitness and healthy living, so the pancreatic cancer came as a huge shock.'

An official statement published on his Instagram said: 'The House of KARL LAGERFELD shares, with deep emotion and sadness, the passing of its creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, on February 19, 2019, in Paris, France.

'He was one of the most influential and celebrated designers of the 21st century and an iconic, universal symbol of style. Driven by a phenomenal sense of creativity, Karl was passionate, powerful and intensely curious.

'He leaves behind an extraordinary legacy as one of the greatest designers of our time, and there are no words to express how much he will be missed.

Celebrities and models and designers have flocked to social media to pay tribute to the late designer.

Donatella Versace was among the first to do so, writing on Instagram: 'Karl your genius touched the lives of so many, especially Gianni [Versace, her brother] and I. We will never forget your incredible talent and endless inspiration. We were always learning from you.'

Fellow designer Marc Jacobs also paid his respects, writing: 'Waking up to a world without Karl. So sad. And strange. He was a great inspiration to me, and, undeniably a unique and extraordinary talent. RESPECT. Rest In Peace KL.'

Chanel muse and actress Diane Kruger revealed in a heartbreaking post, that she was bringing her four-month-old daughter to meet Karl Lagerfeld in France yet admitted 'I was too late'.

Kylie Minogue also shared a message about the designer, writing: 'I loved working with you. Unique, masterful, funny and generous. RIP.'

Claudia Schiffer paid tribute to Lagerfeld on Instagram, writing: 'Karl was my magic dust, he transformed me from a shy German girl into a supermodel.

'He taught me about fashion, style and survival in the fashion business. What Warhol was to art, he was to fashion; he is irreplaceable.

'He is the only person who could make black and white colourful! I will be eternally grateful to him.'

Family first: Lagerfeld adored his cat Choupette, sometimes referred to as his 'daughter' and said in an interview he wanted to be buried with her

In Diane's tribute to the star, she revealed she was set to fly to France this week to introduce Karl to her daughter, as she penned: 'Karl.....I cannot tell you how much you meant to me and how much I will miss you...

'I will never forget your kindness towards me, your laughs, your imagination. I came to France see you this week and introduce you to my daughter...I'm heartbroken I was too late. Rest In Peace, I adore you'.

Supermodel Bella Hadid wrote: 'Nothing feels right today..at a loss for words and so heartbroken by the loss of Karl...

'His humor, wit , love and passion for fashion will live on forever. Thank you for the inspiration that you gave to this world and for all of the hearts that you touched in the process...

'Every time I saw you it felt like the first time & I will miss your hugs so much. Sending my love to the Lagerfeld family and to all closest to him. I am so sorry. We all love you so much. Rest In Peace'.

Ten of Lagerfeld's most acerbic comments On short, unattractive people: 'Life is not a beauty contest, some [ugly people] are great. What I hate is nasty, ugly people... the worst is ugly, short men. Women can be short, but for men it is impossible. It is something that they will not forgive in life... they are mean and they want to kill you.' On people who complain about thin models: 'They are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly.' On former friend and Chanel muse, Inès de la Fressange: 'I wish her all the luck in the world, just so long as I don't have to see her anymore or hear her spoken about.' On pop star, Seal: 'I am no dermatologist but I wouldn't want his skin. Mine looks better than his. He is covered in craters.' On Heidi Klum: 'I don't know Heidi Klum. She was never known in France. Claudia Schiffer also doesn't know who she is.' On fur: 'It is farmers who are nice to the cows and the pigs and then kill them. It's even more hypocritical than hunters. At least the hunters don't flatter the animals....I don't like that people butcher animals, but I don't like them to butcher humans either, which is apparently very popular in the world.' On the Queen: 'She looks a little bit like her grandmother - a more smiley version. 'In terms of what she wears, she's come into herself a little bit more - whatever that is.' On Michelle Obama: 'I don't understand the change of hair. I adore Madame Obama, I love her. But there is a news reader at LCI which has this haircut...Frankly, this doesn't suit her. The fringe was a bad idea, it's not good.' On Adele: 'The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.' On Lana del Rey: 'Is she a construct with all her implants?' Advertisement

Her sister Gigi added: 'I'm so heartbroken I almost don't have words... There will never be another Karl Lagerfeld. Ever second with you was an honour, joy and inspiration. I wish I could give you one last hug. I love you Karl. Thank you for everything. Rest in peace.'

American Vogue editor Anna Wintour says the world has lost 'a giant among men' with the death of Karl Lagerfeld, whom she will miss 'so very much.'

'Karl was so much more than our greatest and most prolific designer,' she said. 'His creative genius was breathtaking and to be his friend was an exceptional gift.

'Karl was brilliant, he was wicked, he was funny, he was generous beyond measure, and he was deeply kind.'

Designer Stella McCartney posted a long message reading: 'This is a truly sad day. To say I knew this gentle man that changed how we all looked at the world, is an honour.

'My heart goes out to his loved ones and to all that felt his delicate and spectacular touch on an industry that is so crowded with characters. He held his place high above all and his sharp wit and mind blew us all away. A true icon...

'One that will be missed for many, many years to come and will always be responsible for so much creative genius. Thank you Karl for all the beauty and for seeing the world through those iconic glasses that were truly rose-tinted with a vision that was like no other. You will be very missed... And always loved x'.

Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of luxury house LVMH, says the world has lost 'a creative genius' with the death of Karl Lagerfeld.

In a statement released by LVMH, Arnault says 'we owe him a great deal: his taste and talent were the most exceptional I have ever known.'

Lagerfeld - dubbed 'Kaiser Karl' and 'Fashion Meister' - was worshiped like a god in fashion circles around the world up until his death.

The Hamburg-born son of a German mother and Swedish father, left his home country for France and the capital of fashion - Paris - in his early 20s and is best known for his association with Chanel, dating back to 1983.

But Lagerfeld, who simultaneously churned out collections for LVMH's Fendi and his eponymous label - an unheard of feat in fashion - was also brand in his own right, much thanks to his unique style.

In his later years, he sported dark suits, white, pony-tailed hair and tinted sunglasses, which made him instantly recognisable, even outside the court of haute couture.

However, his appearance and favourite accessory changed over the years - for a long time he would carry a fan everywhere he went.

Known to adore Diet Coke, Lagerfeld said he shed weight in the early 2000s to fit into the razor-thin suits brought in by Christian Dior's then menswear designer Hedi Slimane.

In rare moments when he was not working, Lagerfeld retired to one of his many homes in Paris, Germany, Italy or Monaco, all of them lavish carbon copies of 18th-century interiors.

While famously reluctant to discuss his love life, Lagerfeld opened up about his partner of 18 years, the late Frenchman Jacques de Bascher, in a 2017 book.

Speaking to author Marie Ottavi for her book about De Bascher, who died of AIDS aged 38, Lagerfeld revealed that during his partner's final days he slept in a cot next to his hospital bed.

De Bascher was well known in Paris high society - in particular for his debauched parties - but even though the couple were together for nearly two decades, until his death in 1989, Lagerfeld said they never had sex.

In 2010, Lagerfeld said he did not sleep with people he loves, and preferred to pay prostitutes for sex.

Speaking to Vice magazine he said: 'I personally only like high-class escorts. I don't like sleeping with people I really love. I don't want to sleep with them because sex cannot last, but affection can last forever. I think this is healthy.

'And for the way the rich live, this is possible. But the other world, I think they need porn.'

Bumping along nicely: Sharing a shot of her shoots with the icon, Kim Kardashian wrote: 'We lost a true legend!!!! You were such an inspiration to the world! You shot my first fashion shoot and I was so nervous to work with such an icon!'

Beloved friend: Alexa Chung, another close ally to Chanel shared a cheeky tribute in which she penned: 'Rest in peace, Karl. I remember being so scared to interview you and yet you were in fact incredibly witty and generous'

Way back when: Chanel model Cara Delevingne shared a candid behind the scenes snap with the caption: 'Such an honour to have been able to meet the legend that was @karllagerfeld A true fashion icon #karllargerfeld #RIP'

The designer mingled with the young and trendy until the last, pairing up with 17-year-old catwalk darling Kaia Gerber, daughter of Cindy Crawford, for a collaboration released by his Karl Lagerfeld brand in 2018.

Lagerfeld was known for his mode muses, but in particular his favourite feline inspiration: his cat Choupette.

The white-haired Birman has been described as the 'daughter of Karl Otto Lagerfeld', and inspired numerous designs by Lagerfeld.

CHOUPETTE: 'THE DAUGHTER OF KARL' By the end of his life, Lagerfeld said his closest relationship was with a white Burmese cat called Choupette. 'I'd marry Choupette if it was legal,' Lagerfeld said in 2013, two years after he 'abducted' the cat from the Chanel model Baptiste Giabiconi. Since then, Lagerfeld had turned Choupette into a model and social media star, earning a multi-million pounds fortune in the process. Close: Karl was exceptionally close to his cat Choupette Lagerfeld told Vanity Fair: 'Choupette was not given to me. Choupette belonged to a friend of mine, who asked my maid if she could take care of her when he was travelling. 'When he returned, he did not get Choupette back*.Choupette became the most famous cat in the world, but also the richest.' Choupette began her modeling career in August 2012, posing in the arms of French supermodel Laetitia Casta by the Eiffel Tower. The cat has since been used in numerous advertising campaigns, including ones of Opel cars and make-up ranges. It is not known who will now look after Choupette.

He was famously close to his cat, and as recently as last April, he told Numéro magazine that he wanted to be buried with his pet.

'There will be no funeral. I'd rather die! I've asked to be cremated and want my ashes to be scattered along with my mother's... And [my cat] Choupette's, if she dies before I do.'

Lagerfeld also stood out as a craftsman. An accomplished photographer, he drew his own designs by hand, an increasingly rare phenomenon in fashion.

His grandiose fashion shows for Chanel have become well known for their extravagance and imagination, with Lagerfeld building huge sets and stages for fashion weeks around the world.

As well as making models walk through a 'Chanel Airport' entrance hall and a super market, he has also built sets meant to look like stables, and a beach in recent years.

Lagerfeld will be succeeded by Virginie Viard, Chanel's fashion creation studio director, who has been his closest collaborator for more than 30 years.

Behind the facade, Lagerfeld was known for his erudition and penchant for literature, and he devoured the world's leading newspapers daily.

Though he long enjoyed befuddling interviewers by citing different years of birth, the one deemed the most reliable is September 10, 1933.

He spent early childhood tucked away from war in the 1,200-acre family estate in Bavaria and had a French tutor.

The big breakthrough came shortly after a move to Paris when, in 1954, he drew a wool coat that won a prize and landed him an apprenticeship with designer Pierre Balmain.

Yves Saint Laurent, who went on to found his namesake label, won the dress prize. The two became fierce competitors and even rivals in love at one point, both chasing the affections of Lagerfeld's eventual partner De Bascher.

Saint Laurent, who died in 2008, became the enfant cheri of high society and Lagerfeld leader of a wild-child younger group.

He first found real success in the mid-1960s with Chloe, the fashion label now owned by Switzerland's Richemont and to which he was connected off and on until 1997, but it was Chanel that propelled him to rock-star status.

Lagerfeld was as harsh with his fashion models as he was searingly critical of anyone he considered 'not trendy'.

He fired his closest female friend, former Chanel model Ines de la Fressange, in 1999 after she agreed to pose as Marianne, France's national symbol, without asking him first.

Occasionally his sharp tongue has stirred controversies, though Lagerfeld, who moonlighted as a cartoonist in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, also had a flair for a good soundbite.

'I'm a kind of fashion nymphomaniac who never gets an orgasm,' he said in 1984, asked about what he felt after a fashion show.

In 2012, he said about singer Adele: 'She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice'.

After the 2011 Royal Wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he said Kate has a 'nice silhouette', but that sister Pippa Middleton 'struggles'.

'I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.'

Another outburst saw him reality TV star Kim Kardashian for being robbed at gun point in Paris, claiming she brought the horrific ordeal on herself by flaunting her wealth.

Some of his most brutal comments were immortalised in a book in 2013 - The World According To Karl.

Not content with upsetting Adele and the Middletons, he then went on to ask whether any part of singer Lana del Rey was real, before offending the whole of Russia with another remark.

'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly,' he quipped.

Another country to feel the sting of his wit was Greece, after the designer weighed into the debate on the nation's financial crisis and corruption problems.

'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image,' he advised. 'It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt.

'You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go. Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.'

He's even had a crack at the press, including magazine Newsweek, whose editor, Tina Brown, ran a story that claimed Lagerfeld was overrated.

'First of all, Tina Brown's magazine is not doing well at all,' he riposted. 'She is dying. I'm sorry for Tina Brown, who was such a success at Vanity Fair, to go down with a s***ty little paper like this. I'm sorry.'

'There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.'

Some of his most brutal comments were immortalised in a book in 2013 - The World According To Karl.

One of his remarks was that 'sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants.'

How Karl Lagerfeld transformed Chanel from an ailing label known for prim tweed suits to a celeb favourite with rockstar edge (but failed to win back the royals after acerbic remarks on the Middletons) By Unity Blott The late Karl Lagerfeld may have reversed the fortunes of ailing fashion label Chanel, but the fashion chief never succeeded in winning over the royal family. The designer, who died on Tuesday aged 85, is widely credited with overhauling the French luxury house, once known for its sensible tweed two-pieces, into a cutting-edge fashion powerhouse synonymous with smudged eyeliner, show-stopping couture and futuristic minis. When he took the helm of Chanel in 1983, he shifted focus away from fragrance and accessories and focused on updating its heritage pieces, injecting much-needed life into its couture line following the death of legendary founder Coco Chanel. As of 2019, he he boasted an A-list following including the likes of Keira Knightley and Kristen Stewart and Chanel was turning over around $10bn (£7.7bn) a year. Chanel has undergone an image overhaul of epic proportions, from tweed two-pieces to futuristic minis (pictured: Kristen Stewart in Chanel at the Cannes Film Festival, May 2018) The way they were: A navy two-piece suit on the Chanel runway in Paris, one of Lagerfeld's first shows for the French fashion house's AW 1983-1984 collection Despite his celebrity clientele, Lagerfeld failed to secure a coveted spot in the royal wardrobe and, unlike other major luxury houses such as Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, was widely snubbed by Palace stylists. The Duchess of Cambridge has notably worn Chanel just once - during a visit to the French capital in 2017 - while the Duchess of Sussex has not been seen in the label since her pre-royal days. Insiders had long suspected the royal snub was linked to Lagerfeld's acid-tongued remarks about the Middletons; after the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he famously said Kate has a 'nice silhouette', but that sister Pippa Middleton 'struggles'. Speaking to a German magazine, he said: 'Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette and she is the right girl for that boy. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties.' The late Princess of Wales once favoured Lagerfeld's designs (pictured in a Chanel suit in Windsor, 1997) but she later refused to wear Chanel because it reminded her of Charles Keira Knightley in Chanel couture for the Atonement premiere at the Venice Film Festival in August 2007. The actress is a Chanel ambassador and has starred in fragrance adverts 'On the other hand, her sister struggles,' the designer added. 'I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.' While the late Princess of Wales once favoured Lagerfeld's designs, she later refused to wear Chanel because its iconic double-C emblem 'reminded her of Charles and Camilla'. Chanel sources confirmed on Tuesday that Lagerfeld had died in Paris at the age of 85 following a period of ill health. His death comes after he missed the Chanel haute couture show in Paris in January for the first time since his arrival in 1983. The Duchess of Cambridge has notably worn Chanel just once - during a visit to the French capital in 2017 (pictured during a visit to Les Invalides military hospital) Lagerfeld was also the creative director of Italian fur and leather goods fashion house Fendi, as well as his eponymous fashion label, which he launched in 1984. The designer had worked with the likes of Chloé and H&M, and was also an acclaimed photographer, having gone behind the lens for a number of high fashion magazines and for his own fashion campaigns. Regarded as one of the most important fashion visionaries of the 20th and 21st centuries, he was known for regularly wearing sunglasses and a black suit with a white shirt, with his grey hair pulled back into a ponytail.

In 2017, the fashion designer sparked outrage by evoking the Holocaust as he attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel for opening the country's borders to migrants.

The German said his country 'cannot - even if there are decades between them - kill millions of Jews so you can bring millions of their worst enemies in their place'.

He added while speaking on a French television show: 'I know someone in Germany who took a young Syrian and after four days said, 'The greatest thing Germany invented was the Holocaust''.

At the time, several hundred lodged official complaints about Lagerfeld's comments after he appeared on the 'Salut les terriens!' (Hello Earthlings!) talkshow on the C8 channel.

The Chanel designer, who was born in Hamburg just as Adolf Hitler came to power, had earlier lambasted Merkel for taking more than one million asylum seekers since the migrant crisis of 2015.

'Merkel had already millions and millions (of immigrants) who are well integrated and who work and all is well... she had no need to take another million to improve her image as the wicked stepmother after the Greek crisis,' said Lagerfeld.

'Suddenly we see the pastor's daughter,' he said in reference to Merkel's father, who was a Protestant minister in the former East Germany.

Lagerfeld said he was going to 'say something horrific' before criticising the chancellor for the 'huge error' of accepting so many refugees from war-torn Syria and elsewhere.

'Look at France, the land of human rights, which has taken, I don't know, 10,000 or 20,000,' he added.

Months later he slammed the #MeToo movement while revealing that he is 'fed up' with models and actresses speaking up about the sexual harassment they have faced over the years.

In a rare climbdown, he half-apologised to Oscar-winner movie actress Meryl Streep after once suggesting she had refused to wear a dress designed by him at an awards ceremony in favour of another she wanted to be paid to wear."

Empire’ writers are reportedly busy making edits in the original script, which scheduled Smollett for nine scenes and a big musical number, according to TMZ.

The medium further reported that Jussie’s character, “Jamal, was originally scheduled to appear in nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode but this would no longer be the case.

“The episodes which are currently being shot will see Jamal appearing in four scenes and his musical number has been taken out of the plot.

“It was also reported that Smollett will no longer be the main focus in the remaining four scenes as he would be flanked by a number of cast members.

“To this end, Jussie will be spending way less time on set without rehearsal,’’ it said.

It was also reported that Smollett, who plays the role of ‘Jamal Lyon’ in ‘Empire,’ will enjoy less screen time.

This move, TMZ reports, is in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the widely reported attack on him.

Smollett was assaulted in Chicago by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slur at him.

Smollett told police that he had just landed in town from New York and was attacked as he stepped out to get a bite to eat at a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m.

On East North Lower Water Street, in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville.

Meanwhile there are reports that two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, might have been paid off by Smollett to stage the attack.

The brothers were arrested on February 13, 2019, in connection to the case.

They were picked up at the airport in Chicago after they arrived from Nigeria where they had gone to spend some time with their family.

Interestingly, the brothers have been released with no charges as the police revealed there is now new evidence.

Smollett has also vehemently denied paying the two brothers $3,500 to attack him.

His lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, disclosed to Entertainment Weekly that the star is now being victimised over the false allegations of him staging the incident.

Also, the reports added that one of the brothers was Smollett’s trainer for a music video. (NAN)

Smollett is now the face of racist parody film posters that have sprung up in Los Angeles in the wake of his alleged attack in Chicago and an unraveling narrative.

It is learned that at least two posters popped up yesterday, February 18 at a bus station near Fox Studios in Century City, which feature Smollett’s mug photoshopped onto the backdrop of posters for “BlacKkKlansman” and “Black Panther.” Both posters mock claims Smollett made about the alleged attack.

For instance, the “Black Panther” poster shows Smollett as T’Challa in the ‘BP’ costume and the title has been changed to “Black Prankster.”

The “BlacKkKlansman” poster depicts Smollet from his “GMA” interview with a photoshopped MAGA hat and coat on, with the phrase “This is MAGA country!” superimposed in the background. Both posters are jokingly offering Smollett for consideration for “Best Fictional Story” and “Best Actor in a Drama.

Interestingly, the posters have been signed by conservative street artist Sabo (the same guy that put up the Meryl Streep “She Knew” posters in 2017 after the Weinstein scandal broke).

It would be recalled we earlier reported that the police believe Smollett rehearsed the “attack” with the two Nigerian brothers. A grand jury is set to hear evidence soon, and potential indictment against Smollett could be forthcoming."

President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE faces mounting challenges to his controversial emergency declaration, which critics say circumvents Congress to secure billions of additional dollars for a wall along the southern border.

Two liberal advocacy groups are suing the administration to block the order. A third lawsuit, launched by a group of 16 states, dropped last night .

Trump’s executive action has mobilized liberal voters, who rallied across the country over the weekend at events coordinated by MoveOn. Hundreds of people gathered in front of the White House on Monday to protest the executive action.

And Democrats in Congress are plotting an aggressive response.

Mike Lillis and Scott Wong report that House Democrats are in no rush to push a resolution through, preferring instead to allow GOP divisions to fester ( The Hill ).

But at some point soon, the House will vote on a joint resolution to terminate Trump’s executive action.

That measure will pass with ease, sending it over to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53 to 47 majority. Democrats will need to pick up at least four GOP lawmakers to push the resolution through the upper chamber.

That seems likely, given the backlash from some on the right against what they view as a power grab by the executive branch.

But what then?

White House adviser Stephen Miller says that if Congress passes the joint resolution to block the executive action, the president will veto it. Trump has not yet used the presidential veto, so this could be his first.

That would kick things back to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required to override the presidential veto.

That’s possible but appears very unlikely, at least at the moment, meaning the best hope for Democrats to block the emergency declaration may lie in the courts.

A House and Senate vote with a united Democratic Party and some GOP defections could be a factor in how the courts decide the case. That kind of vote breakdown would hurt the administration’s emergency argument.

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





WHITE HOUSE & ADMINISTRATION: Trump made the case for regime change in Venezuela during a speech in Miami last night that effectively doubled as campaign rally.

The U.S. recognizes Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela. Trump warned the Venezuela military that they’re risking their lives by continuing to support Nicolas Maduro.

“You will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You’ll lose everything.” – Trump

The speech also served the president’s 2020 reelection interests. Trump made a direct appeal to Latino voters, a key constituency in Florida. And he warned about the dangers of socialism, a message that figures to be central to his reelection bid.

“The twilight hour of socialism has arrived… Socialism is a sad and discredited ideology, rooted in the total ignorance of history and human nature, which is why socialism eventually must always give rise to tyranny, which it does.” - Trump

McCabe also said that DOJ and FBI officials discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove the president. He insists that Rosenstein offered on multiple occasions to wear a wire in talks with Trump.

Rosenstein is expected to depart the DOJ of his own accord next month.

Trump spent President’s Day lashing out at McCabe and Rosenstein.

The president’s allies are demanding a new investigation into McCabe’s claims that the nation’s top law enforcement officials discussed removing the president. They’re describing those conversations as an “illegal coup.”

⭆ Entertainment: The bizarre saga of Jussie Smollett, the “Empire” actor who claims he was assaulted by Trump supporters for being black and gay, is shifting rapidly. Police want to interview Smollett after two people of interest to the case told investigators they were paid by the actor to orchestrate the alleged hate crime ( CNN ). Smollett, who could face charges if his claims turn out to be a hoax, declined to meet with the police on Monday ( CBS 2 Chicago ).

Following the drama around the Covington High School boys and their encounter with a Native American protester, many conservatives are venting their frustration with the media for leaping to conclusions over allegations that bigoted Trump supporters harassed or attacked minorities, which have turned out to be untrue.

Robby Soave : Separating “reality” from “narrative” in the Smollett case.

⭆ Outdoors: Hunters are sounding the alarm about a new disease spreading among deer, elk and moose. The “chronic wasting disease” has been identified in 24 states and can be transferred to humans who eat the tainted meat. The disease is reportedly resistant to freezing, heating and cooking the meat ( NBC News ).

⭆ Education: California’s top colleges and universities are scrambling to reassess how they adjudicate cases of sexual misconduct. A series of court rulings have found that Obama-era policies aimed at bolstering the rights of accusers have been unfair to the accused ( The Los Angeles Times ).

⭆ Amazon: Big Tech companies are doing some soul searching after backlash provoked Amazon to withdraw its plans to build a second headquarters in New York City ( The Hill ). Critics of the deal cast Amazon’s withdrawal as a victory over corporate welfare. Supporters of the deal are blaming liberals , such as Ocasio-Cortez, for costing the city thousands of jobs. Ben Smith of BuzzFeed writes that the nixed deal is the latest example of the liberal base putting the establishment on notice about their newfound power.

Bill de Blasio : Amazon could have answered concerns from citizens but fled instead.

The New York Daily News : Deal sunk by politicians who don’t understand economics.





THE CLOSER





And finally … A reminder of how U.S. presidents have a long history of citing national emergencies to justify executive actions.

On this day in 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of people of Japanese ancestry from designated “military zones” in the U.S.

The order paved the way for the mass relocation and incarceration of about 120,000 Japanese people, more than two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens.

Those who did not comply with the order to leave their jobs and homes were arrested. The order also swept up more than 10,000 people of Italian and German ancestry.

Read the executive order HERE .

The Supreme Court later upheld the order by a 6-3 margin in a case brought by Fred Korematsu, who was arrested for failing to report to a detention center. The high court described the order as a “military necessity” and said it was not based on race. But many view the order as “the legalization of racism.” It’s cited to this day by critics who view Trump’s travel ban and wall as discriminatory against immigrants, rather than national security imperatives.

Here are The Hill’s rankings of where the contenders stand right now.

1. Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Fallout from Trump's weekend rally The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - After rough week, can Trump bounce back? Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines MORE (D-Calif.)

Harris has had by far the best launch of any candidate.

Her speech declaring her candidacy was delivered powerfully before a large and appreciative crowd in Oakland. Her appearances in early states have been well-received, as have her initial round of media interview. More generally, she has effectively presented herself as a fresh and charismatic presence.

Harris has also rolled out some early endorsements including Rep. Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeCongress must promote racial healing — this proven community method offers a blueprint Democrats see path to ridding Capitol of Confederate statues Here are the Confederate statues in the Capitol MORE (D-Calif.) and, on Friday alone, both California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Hispanic civil rights icon Dolores Huerta.

There are still plenty of questions that Harris will have to answer — including how her long record as a prosecutor will be scrutinized by a Democratic base focused on questions of police misconduct and racial inequities.

Early front-runners can easily come unstuck, but for now Harris is the most formidable candidate in the race.

Previous ranking on Jan. 1: 4

2. Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump seeks to rally base with immigration full-court press Trump says Obama may have committed treason Poll: Biden leads Trump by more than 20 points on race and policing MORE

For all the excitement around Harris, it is the former vice president who still heads every significant nationwide poll of Democratic voters.

In an Emerson poll released on Saturday, he was 10 points ahead of his closest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersCelebrities and politicians speak out over 90 percent cut in polling sites ahead of Kentucky primary Biden beat Bernie but the battle between progressives and pragmatists still rages Trump: Ocasio-Cortez would beat Schumer MORE (I-Vt.), with Harris third, a further 2 points behind. A Morning Consult poll earlier last week put Biden 7 points clear of Sanders and 16 points ahead of Harris.

In 2016, Biden mulled a run for a long time before deciding against it. His son Beau had died from brain cancer in May 2015, and Biden ultimately chose not to force himself thorough the rigors of a presidential campaign.

This time around, The Hill has reported that he is almost certain to declare a candidacy soon.

Biden has weaknesses in the race, including his age — he would be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and past votes that sit uneasily with the current Democratic base on everything from the Iraq War to a 1994 crime bill.

But his skills as retail politician, his experience and the loyal service he rendered for eight years to President Obama would all stand in his favor.

Previous ranking: 3

3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Sanders entered the race early Tuesday, following weekend reports that he had recorded a video announcing his candidacy.

Sanders will clearly be a top-flight contender. Polls generally put him second, behind Biden.

He could end up being a victim of his own relative success in one sense, however. His stronger than expected challenge to eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Fallout from Trump's weekend rally Biden beat Bernie but the battle between progressives and pragmatists still rages Biden still has a Hispanic voter problem, but does it matter? MORE in 2016 showed there was an appetite in the party for more left-wing policies. Now, several other declared or likely candidates are running on progressive platforms that could blunt Sanders’s formerly unique appeal.

He has other problems as well, including the enmity he earned among Clinton supporters in 2016.

In January, he apologized to women who say they were harassed or mistreated by male staff during his 2016 campaign.

His decision to give his own rebuttal to President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE’s State of the Union speech aggravated some activists who believed he was taking the spotlight from the Democrats’ official speaker of the night, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

Age is an issue for Sanders, too. He is 77.

Previous ranking: 2

4. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas)

Will he or won’t he?

That’s the key question around O’Rourke, who ignited enormous Democratic enthusiasm in his ultimately unsuccessful challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrade groups make lobbying push to be included in small business loan program Republicans take aim at Google in fight to remove legal shield Roberts sparks backlash from conservative senators with DACA ruling MORE (R-Texas) last year.

O’Rourke’s intentions are far from clear. He embarked on a road trip in January, earning some mockery from detractors for his introspective musings in an online diary.

On the other hand, when Trump held a rally in O’Rourke’s home base of El Paso recently, the former Texas congressman headlined his own event nearby, which drew a crowd several thousand strong.

The longer O’Rourke stays out of the race, the greater the danger that someone like Harris could really catch fire. On the other hand, his prodigious fundraising ability — he raised an eye-popping $38 million in 2018’s third quarter during his Senate bid — ensures he would be a serious candidate.

Previous ranking: 1

5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenRomanoff touts endorsements ahead of primary against Hickenlooper Biden beat Bernie but the battle between progressives and pragmatists still rages Left eyes huge night in NY, Kentucky primaries MORE (D-Mass.)

It’s been a largely uninspiring start to the campaign for Warren, who had been considered one of the leading candidates in the early running.

Part of the problem is the issue that won’t quit — her prior self-identification as a Native American and her decision last year to take a DNA test to prove that she was telling the truth.

The test affirmed that she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago. But even some Democrats believe the whole episode played into the hands of Trump, who continues to deride Warren, whom he has long mocked as “Pocahontas.”

Warren is betting that there is a strong electoral market for someone who can combine her professorial in-depth knowledge, especially of financial regulation, with a style that savors confrontation with Trump.

But her initial poll ratings are average at best, fueling suspicions that she is being overtaken by other figures, particularly Harris, who may have a stronger personal magnetism.

Previous ranking: 5

6. Sen. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerRomanoff touts endorsements ahead of primary against Hickenlooper Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines The Hill's Campaign Report: Candidates, lawmakers mark Juneteenth MORE (D-N.J.)

Booker is one of the most recent entrants into the race — he announced on Feb. 1.

The New Jersey senator divides opinion, especially inside the Beltway. To his supporters, he is a likable, energetic candidate who speaks passionately and has the capacity to fire up young and nonwhite voters with particular vigor.

His detractors, however, assail him as an inauthentic lightweight, who has long been more interested in promoting himself than anything else. That critique stretches from his time as the Twitter-friendly mayor of Newark to his self-proclaimed “Spartacus moment” during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden beat Bernie but the battle between progressives and pragmatists still rages All eyes on Roberts ahead of Supreme Court's abortion ruling Acting DHS Secretary: Supreme Court DACA ruling 'usurps the clear authority of executive branch' MORE.

Booker will likely need to show he can get traction fairly soon, before the expected arrival of other big stars on the stage — including Biden — threatens to push him toward the margins of the race.

Previous ranking: 7

7. Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy KlobucharSusan Collins opposes Trump's pick for Fifth Circuit Celebrities and politicians speak out over 90 percent cut in polling sites ahead of Kentucky primary Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines MORE (D-Minn.)

Klobuchar certainly had an eye-catching campaign launch — she gave a speech declaring her candidacy in the midst of a heavy snowstorm.

The visuals were memorable and underlined Klobuchar’s core message that she is a down-to-earth contender from the heartlands.

But that in itself won’t assuage the doubts about Klobuchar’s ultimate chances of success: Do Democrats really want someone who leans toward centrism as their standard-bearer against Trump?

Recent allegations that she mistreated staff have further complicated Klobuchar’s chances.

Some of the milder accusations against her carry more than a whiff of sexism, but it is harder to make that case when it comes to the most dramatic allegations, including one instance where she purportedly threw a binder that struck a staff member.

Previous ranking: 8

8. Sen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownCOVID-19 waivers emerge as flashpoint in absence of liability shield Senators call on Trump administration to simplify PPP loan forgiveness process Hillicon Valley: Senators raise concerns over government surveillance of protests | Amazon pauses police use of its facial recognition tech | FBI warns hackers are targeting mobile banking apps MORE (D-Ohio)

Brown has long been a political curiosity: a progressive Democrat who continues to win reelection in the increasingly red state of Ohio by wide margins.

Brown has been building up some momentum with a tour of early-voting states. But it is not clear he is getting into the race, and the likely entrance of Biden — who has a similar blue-collar appeal — would greatly complicate the Ohioan’s possible path to the nomination.

Previous ranking: 6

9. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandGOP rallies around Trump after firing of Manhattan US attorney Schumer says he won't return blue slip if Trump nominates Clayton as US attorney Graham signals he won't take up U.S. attorney pick without Schumer, Gillibrand signoff MORE (D-N.Y.)

Gillibrand launched her campaign in mid-January with an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” on CBS. Sadly for the New York senator, that’s the most memorable thing she has done so far.

Gillibrand always faced an uphill climb toward the nomination. There is nothing to suggest the gradient has become any less steep.

Previous ranking: 10

10. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

Bloomberg continues to toy with a bid, but it is enormously difficult to see a credible route for the former New York City mayor, despite his vast fortune.

Bloomberg’s business-friendly centrism seems a poor fit for today’s Democratic Party, and he is far from a natural politician on the stump, which would hinder him in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Previous ranking: 9

""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,"" Ola and Abel Osundairo told CBS 2. ""We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,"" said the brothers, who were described as Nigerian in earlier reports. Smollett told police that he was attacked in Chicago last month by two men who shouted racist and homophobic insults before putting a rope around his neck and yelling: ""This is MAGA country."" One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer.

The brothers were released last week without being charged. Police said they provided information that changed the course of the investigation. Sources tell CBS 2 that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 for the attack—and reimbursed them for the rope. One source says Smollett decided to orchestrate the attack because he didn't get a ""bigger reaction"" a week earlier when he received a letter containing a white powder—later found to be aspirin—and a threatening note in cut-out magazine letters. ""When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,"" the source says. Evidence seized from the brothers' home includes a magazine and stamps. TMZ, which said Sunday that the case could be headed to a grand jury soon, reports that as suspicion Smollett staged the attack grows, his Empire screen time has been cut, with several scenes and a musical number axed from the episode currently being filmed.

The men allegedly identified themselves as Trump supporters, and they identified Smollett as “that faggot Empire nigger.” According to Smollett, the assailants bashed the actor’s face, crushed his ribs, splashed him with bleach, and pulled a noose around his neck. In the following days, Smollett addressed his many well-wishers, including his Empire colleagues as well as prominent civil rights activists and Democratic politicians. “These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily,” Smollett said. “I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

Smollett presented his case as a cause. Al Sharpton petitioned President Donald Trump to denounce the attackers, who allegedly targeted Smollett in the president’s name, using his divisive slogan. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker—two black Democratic presidential candidates—both described the Smollett attack as “a modern-day lynching.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described the attack as “an affront to our humanity,” and freshman Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez underscored the right-wing motivations in the alleged assault on Smollett, a gay, black actor who routinely criticizes Trump. “It was a racist and homophobic attack,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.” The statistics are real; the “modern-day” lynchings are a classic terror.

But Pelosi deleted her supportive tweet Monday as it emerged that the Smollett investigation may end up revealing a hoax; Smollett may have staged the assault as a self-aggrandizing political statement. Chicago police questioned two men they considered suspects—two Nigerian brothers who have both worked with Smollett on Empire—and the investigators now seem to believe that Smollett staged the attack. For three weeks, he has struggled to reconcile his initial account of the attack, his redacted phone records, and his subsequent public statements about key details, such as the skin color of the two alleged assailants. Chicago police say their conversations with the Nigerians have “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and suggested that Smollett may soon become a suspect. On Monday, the performer declined to meet with Chicago detectives again to discuss the latest developments in the case.

Related How the Media Turned the MAGA Teens Into Martyrs

Conservative pundits have disputed Smollett’s account from the beginning, and they cited the broad support for Smollett—at least initially—as a lesson in liberal media bias, its ubiquity, and its perils. If last month’s Covington Catholic High School controversy was a great vindication for conservatives, then the Smollett fiasco has been a secondary humiliation for liberals, a juicy postscript for right-wing pundits seeking momentum in their perpetual grievance against the press. Writing for the National Review, Kyle Smith chronicled his disbelief in the form of 27 questions for Smollett’s stalwart supporters: “Did it not occur to you that the whole alleged attack looked a bit like the criminal equivalent of a press release, meant to send a message rather than accomplish anything?” Smith wondered. It is not as if liberal critics haven’t also asked these questions. However sympathetic they may have initially been, liberal observers have indeed cultivated grave doubts about Smollett. Pelosi deleted her tweet: “Given the turn in the investigation, we decided to no longer amplify the original accusation,” Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told Vanity Fair. Sharpton has backed down and said that Smollett and the current suspects “ought to face accountability to the maximum” if they staged the attack.

Indeed, Smollett’s allies have gradually, grudgingly turned on the actor, expecting Chicago authorities to charge Smollett with filing a false report. If it’s revealed that he did so, Smollett will have disgraced himself, his friends, and his political allies; he will have mocked countless lynching victims, and so he will have betrayed his own people, his own principles, his own cause.

The loud doubts about Smollett now dominate news coverage of the investigation. If the Covington outrage was, among conservatives, an argument for withholding hot-headed judgments in the absence of full context or conclusive evidence, then conservatives have made a sudden, self-serving reversal in the Smollett case: They rushed to dispute Smollett’s account before the actual investigators could get a word in edgewise. Chicago police have so far disputed right-wing characterizations of Smollett, the attack, and the ongoing investigation. They’re now squeezed between two factions who need Smollett to represent a great cause for alarm: for liberals, a penchant among Trump supporters for committing hate crimes; for conservatives, a penchant among journalists for believing the worst about Trump supporters. So liberal support for Smollett seems to predate the evidence, but so, too, does the conservative skepticism about Smollett—and about hate crimes in general, which seems to predate any of the relevant revelations. It’s possible that Smollett has exploited, or attempted to exploit, this very dynamic, which ostensibly would have lent him political credibility in excess of his television fame. Smollett’s credibility may indeed persist, among a decimated faction, in light of these apparent revelations. Smollett’s stalwart supporters have already begun to wonder whether the Chicago Police Department—disgraceful in its own infamous ways—is covering for the real attackers. The truth is inscrutable.

The polarization, in this case, may well prove to be Smollett’s own, grotesque design. In the days after the alleged attack, he turned to Good Morning America to publicize it and to dispel the emerging doubts about his story. “If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” Smollett told Robin Roberts. In the aftermath of this affair, Smollett sought a political catharsis. Unfortunately, he may have found one."

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s new mandatory threat reporting system for schools is drawing thousands of tips in its first month. Officials say this week the Safe 2 Say Something program run by the attorney general’s office fielded more than 4,900 reports since it was launched in early January. The program passed the Legislature with near unanimity last year, mandating participation by all K-12 students in Pennsylvania.

That includes charter, private and vocational-technical schools. The reports come in through the phone, by email and via an app. They’re fielded by a team at the attorney general’s office in downtown Harrisburg. Callers are assured of anonymity. Similar programs are mandated in four other states. Officials say Pennsylvania is the first state to do a comprehensive launch of the program.

CINCINNATI (AP) — The new owners of Cincinnati’s historic Showboat Majestic say they plan to continue using the double-decker riverboat as an entertainment venue. WCPO-TV reports Adams County real estate agent Joe Brumley and his wife bought the country’s last floating theater for around $110,000 this month after Cincinnati put it up for auction, citing high maintenance costs.

They plan to move the boat to Moyer Winery in Manchester, a town on the Ohio River roughly 55 miles (89 kilometers) southeast of Cincinnati. The move will cost more than twice the auction price, but they’re hoping it will pay off as a new tourist attraction in the area. The boat was built in 1923 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

BRADDOCK, Pa. (AP) — Police in western Pennsylvania are investigating the theft of 13 stained glass windows from a shuttered church in suburban Pittsburgh. The Mon-Valley Initiative says a passer-by noticed the theft Thursday at the 126-year-old former First United Presbyterian Church in Braddock. The church, built in 1893, shut down in 2017 and was purchased by the nonprofit last year for housing.

Spokesman Jason Togyer said officials planned to retain many of the original features. Laura Zinski, Mon-Valley Initiative’s chief executive officer, urged local antique or salvage dealers to be on the lookout for the 2-by-2-foot, 3-by-foot panes of glass, which feature designs including a large lily set against a background of cream-colored hexagons. Braddock police said those responsible may have also tried to break into Braddock Carnegie Library last week as well.

LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) — A Florida sixth-grader faces charges of disrupting a school function and resisting arrest after a confrontation that followed his refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. In a statement Sunday, Lakeland Police say a school resource officer was alerted to a disturbance created by a student in the classroom at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy on Feb. 4. According to police, the student initially refused to leave the room, continued to be disruptive and made threats while being escorted to the school’s office by the officer and the school’s dean.

The statement says the student was charged based on his failure to comply with the officer’s and the dean’s orders, not his refusal to participate in the pledge. Polk County students aren’t required to stand for the pledge.

In a WTSP-TV report , the boy’s mother said the 11-year-old normally declines to stand for the pledge. He had a substitute teacher on Feb. 4 and she had ordered him to stand up. The boy’s mother said the school should have disciplined her son differently. He has moved to a private school. In a statement Monday, school district officials said the substitute teacher had not been aware of the policy allowing students to opt out of the pledge.

She was asked to leave the school after the boy’s arrest and she would no longer be allowed to work in any of the district’s schools, officials said. According to the statement, the officer decided to arrest the student, though no one from the school requested to press charges. “We do not condone the substitute’s behavior. We respect our students’ right to freedom of expression and we are committed to protecting that critical right while ensuring peaceful classrooms so all students can learn,” the statement said.

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault. Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lisa Borders says she has resigned as president and CEO of Time’s Up, the gender equality initiative formed last year in response to sexual misconduct allegations in Hollywood. Borders says in statement Monday that she is stepping aside “with deep regret” due to family issues. She didn’t elaborate.

Chief Operating Officer Rebecca Goldman will serve as interim CEO while the organization conducts an executive search. Borders, former president of the WNBA, was named head of Time’s Up last year.

The organization was formed in January 2018 in response to sexual misconduct allegations leveled against powerful men in the entertainment industry including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.

CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) — Glance around the “Jeopardy!” set during rehearsals for its first-ever team championship and it’s easy to be intimidated by the assembled brain power. There’s Brad Rutter, whose overall “Jeopardy!” haul, $4.3 million, is the most won on any game show. And Ken Jennings, a 74-game winner and top moneymaker, with $2.5 million, in non-tournament “Jeopardy!” competition. And Buzzy Cohen, the reigning Tournament of Champions winner.

They’re among the six captains who will join their teams in competing for a top $1 million prize in a series of 10 episodes that begin airing Wednesday and conclude March 5. The other three captains: Julia Collins, No. 2 in overall winnings on the show; Colby Burnett, a Teachers Tournament and Tournament of Champions victor, and Austin Rogers, No. 5 in games and money won. “It’s like the Mount Rushmore of ‘Jeopardy!'” observed Jimmy McGuire, part of the traveling “clue crew” that poses video answers from distant spots.

But what else should you know about this chart-topping hitmaker? Here's the lowdown...

What has Cardi B said about Jussie Smollett?

The rapper took to Instagram live video to let known her feelings on the constantly evolving Jussie Smollett case.

Whilst eating lobster, the New Yorker reflected on reports that the attack on the Empire actor was staged, telling her fans:

""I am really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*** his name is. I'm really disappointed in him.

""I feel like he f***d up Black History Month bro. Like damn. I'm not going to say yet until he said out his mouth at it was fake and staged

""I don't want to completely blame him because you know like somebody, that I was talking to, they said that police in Chicago are racist so they might try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar, but if he's not then bro you f***d up for real.

""Why would you do that? Then you f****** give Donald Trump immunity to f****** laugh at n*****s and s**t.""

What did Cardi B win at the Grammys?

Cardi won her first ever Grammy at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.

The rapper took home the award for Rap Album for Invasion of Privacy.

She was also nominated for four other awards but lost out, including:

Album for Invasion of Privacy

for Invasion of Privacy Record for I Like It

for I Like It Pop Duo/Group Performance for Girls Like You with Maroon 5

for Girls Like You with Maroon 5 Rap Performance for Be Careful

Who is Cardi B?

Cardi B, real name Belcalis Almanzar, is originally from the Bronx in New York and started out as a stripper.

She said the money she made from stripping helped her pay for school.

Cardi began to get more high profile as she documented her life on social media.

In 2015, she joined the reality show Love and Hip Hop: New York for two seasons.

She left the show to concentrate on her music career.

She won Best New Hip Hop Artist, Single of the Year, Hustler of the Year at the BET Hip Hop awards in 2017.

On October 1, 2018, it was revealed Cardi has been charged with alleged reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct after an incident at the Angels Strip Club in Flushing in New York.

The rapper has a large following on social media and can be found on Instagram/Twitter: @iamcardib.

Has Cardi B split from husband Offset?

Cardi and Offset have reconciled and put on a united front at the Grammys 2019.

They have since released a steamy video for their collaboration 'Clout' and on Mother's Day, Offset showered his wife with gifts.

As recently as June, 2019, Cardi shared a picture of the two of them strolling arm-in-arm on Instagram and captioned the picture: ""I love you"".

However, via the micro-blogging website on December 5, 2018 she broke the news that she'd split from Offset.

In a video clip simply captioned ‘There you go, peace and love"", she said: “So everybody been bugging me and everything and you know I’ve been trying to work things out with my baby father for a hot minute now.

“We are really good friends and we are really good business partners— you know he’s always somebody that I run to talk, and we got a lot of love for each other but things just haven’t been working out between us for a long time.

“It’s nobody’s fault I guess we just grew out of love but we are not together anymore.

“I don’t know it might take time to get a divorce and I’m going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter’s father… And, yeah…”

Offset confirmed the news by commenting below the post ""Y'all won"".

Cardi married Offset secretly in September 2017 but didn't reveal the news until June, 2018.

When did Cardi B have her baby?

Cardi gave birth to her daughter Kulture Kiari Cephus on July 10.

The rapper posted on Instagram to announce the news.

The music star shared a picture of herself posing naked during her pregnancy along with a message revealing her daughter arrived on Tuesday.

She also disclosed the baby's name, simply writing: ""Kulture Kiari Cephus 07/10/18 @offsetyrn.""

Cardi B gave birth at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia with Offset by her side.

What is Cardi B's single Bodak Yellow? What are her other songs?

Cardi B has also become the first female rapper in 19 years to reach the number 1 spot on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Back in 1998, Lauryn Hill made history with Doo Wop (That Thing) becoming the first female rapper to top the US charts.

She has also had hits with:

I Like It

Be Careful

MotorSport

Drip

Bartier Cardi

Money

She featured on Bruno Mars' Finesse which hit No5 and Maroon 5's No7 hit Girls Like You.

Cardi also had a No8 hit with I Like It featuring Bad Bunny and J Balvin.

What was the Nicki Minaj fight about?

During a New York Fashion Week event in September 2018, the two female rappers came to loggerheads.

The scrap, which kicked off at the Harper's Bazaar bash in Manhattan, left Cardi B with a huge bump on her forehead.

TMZ reported that Cardi approached Nicki to confront her over the ""lies she was spreading"".

The pair - dressed in fancy frocks - were separated by security.

The bump on Cardi's head is reported to be the result of security elbowing her in the face amid the struggle.

This won’t last very long. Our ever mendacious press corps will want to get this evidence of their malfeasance off the front page and out of the public view, as soon as possible. Moreover, the way these things generally work, absent some other egregious circumstances that have yet to out, Smollett will likely do little or no time over his criminal conspiracy.

Previously, here and here, I’ve advocated using the leftists’ legal tactics against them. This is also might be a good way to get a pound of flesh out of Smollett, especially since it’s unlikely that the criminal justice side of the house will. And the best part? Mr Smollett himself, has provided President Trump the tool to to do so, by his decision to state in a police report that the two men who allegedly beat him, were wearing “MAGA” hats.

As we all know, Donald Trump is all about “brand.” Early on in his presidential campaign, he took steps to trademark, “MAGA. Not only did he trademark it, he actively and vigorously defended that trademark from infringement.

From CNN Money,

Trump has had enough of the copycats. Now he’s getting his lawyer involved. One of his first targets is CafePress, a popular website where people can print T-shirts, coffee mugs and other garb. The company received a “cease and desist” letter from Trump’s lawyer at the end of September. Trump’s legal team made it very clear there would be a lawsuit against CafePress unless the site stopped peddling “Make America Great Again” merchandise. “This isn’t about money. This is about protecting one’s brand and trademark,” Trump’s lawyer Alan Garten told CNNMoney.

Donald Trump should use this opportunity handed to him by Smollett. He should sue him six ways from Sunday for bringing harm to the MAGA brand. Tie him up in court(s) hemorrhaging money to pay lawyers until he cries “uncle.” This is the way to deal with leftists who attack. Hit them where it hurts right in their swollen pocketbooks.

Their attacks have bankrupted a stellar 3-Star General, forcing him to sell his home to pay legal bills. It would be great to see one or more of these leftists get the same treatment as General Flynn. As an added benefit, as this case plays out, each news story about some milestone in the case will enable President Trump to remind America again and again, just how corrupt our press is.

What’s next: It’s unclear how the Venezuelan opposition would break the blockade. John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. military, which has airlifted supplies to the Venezuela-Colombia border, would not enter the country.

Another angle: The crisis has prompted plans for dueling concerts this weekend, one organized by the British billionaire Richard Branson and one by the Venezuelan government.

Double role for a major consulting firm

McKinsey & Company, which says it offers management advice to 90 of the world’s 100 biggest companies, also has a secretive $12.3 billion investment arm, prompting questions about conflicts of interest.

In Puerto Rico, where McKinsey is advising a board that seeks to reduce the island’s debt, the company’s hedge fund has investments in that debt, according to a report released on Monday.

Response: McKinsey says the way the fund is operated ensures that its employee investors do not stand to benefit from the firm’s inside knowledge. But those assurances have been challenged in Congress and in lawsuits."

Unlike most presidential hopefuls, who come to New Hampshire years before the primary, Ms Harris — who is from California and relatively new to the national political stage — waited until roughly a year before the primary to show up. Barack Obama, who had never been to New Hampshire before running for president, visited the state in December 2006, about 13 months before its 2008 primary.

Ms Harris knew her lack of time in the state might raise eyebrows, and she addressed it head-on at the town hall meeting in Portsmouth.

“Let me address the elephant in the room,” she began, then laughed, saying there were no elephants — the mascot of the Republican Party — in this particular room.

“I intend to compete in New Hampshire,” she declared. “I intend to spend time here. I intend to shake every hand I possibly can,” she said to wild applause from the hundreds of people packed into the large sanctuary of Portsmouth’s historic South Church.

And, she said, “I intend to do very well in New Hampshire.”

That drew big applause, too, but it was a careful hedge. Ms Harris is fully aware that her challengers for the Democratic nomination are likely to include one if not two fellow senators from neighbouring states: Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has announced her candidacy, and Bernie Sanders from Vermont is expected to announce soon. New Hampshire has a long history of favouring New England candidates.

Despite Mr Sanders’ popularity here — he won 60 per cent of the vote in the 2016 primary — Ms Harris distanced herself from him at an earlier event in Concord. Asked if she would have to tack to the left like Mr Sanders to do well in New Hampshire, she drew a line in the sand.

“The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist,” she said. Mr Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, a label that some prominent Democrats have also embraced, including representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

During that visit in Concord before the town hall, Ms Harris also seemed unsure at first when she was asked about a message from her Twitter account on 29 January about Mr Smollett, whose story about being attacked in Chicago by two men yelling racist and homophobic comments is now under investigation by police. Chicago news media outlets have reported that detectives are reviewing whether the attack Mr Smollett reported had been a hoax.

“Which tweet? What tweet?” Ms Harris said in response to the question about her use of the “modern day lynching” phrase. After a moment, she said, “I think the facts are still unfolding and I’m very concerned” about the initial allegation by Mr Smollett. She said “there should be an investigation” and declined to comment further until it was complete.

At Ms Harris’ town hall in Portsmouth, people squeezed in from wall to wall and lines stretched down the street for two blocks; an overflow crowd outside was turned away. Most members of the audience, which varied widely in age and was predominantly white, enthusiastically leapt to their feet repeatedly to applaud her liberal positions, even if she often lacked detail.

Ms Harris said America was not working for working people, that health care costs were driving people to near bankruptcy and that she supported “Medicare for all.” She blasted the pharmaceutical companies for an “immoral” system in which they “gouge the public” and are more concerned with profits than public health. Although she was not asked about the state’s opioid crisis, one of the worst in the country, she brought it up a couple of times.

She railed against gun violence, described climate change as man-made and endorsed the Green New Deal. She lamented that money that should be spent on public education was instead going to mass incarceration. She endorsed comprehensive immigration reform.

In an answer to a question, she said she would support changes in voting laws that would allow for same-day registration and make Election Day a national holiday. In answer to another question, she said she supported renaming Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.

Some answers were more vague than others. One questioner, noting that the Democrats generally appeal to voters on the coasts, asked her how she would appeal to the heartland.

“I reject the notion that depending on where you were born, you don’t identify with someone else,” she responded. “This election will come down to who the American public believes will be a leader.”

The audience also responded heartily to her veiled references to President Donald Trump, whom she did not name. They rose to their feet and cheered when she denounced “his vanity project,” the wall on the southern border with Mexico.

Although Ms Harris’ lack of history in the state might fly in the face of New Hampshire tradition, it does not seem to have hindered her in the slightest.

“There was some question about whether she was going to campaign here,” said Michael O’Leary, 62, a retired insurance manager. “But she made that commitment to retail politics, and that’s what people here expect.” He called her “fantastic.”

Ms Harris has hired a state campaign director, Craig Brown, as well as a political director here, Meredith Shevitz.

Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, said that with Ms Warren and possibly Mr Sanders in the race, New Hampshire was not an essential win for Ms Harris, which may partly explain her late start.

“A third-place showing here would be fine,” he said. “For her, South Carolina is more of a make-or-break state.”

And in any event, he said, “she has California waiting for her,” referring to the earlier-than-usual 2020 primary in her home state that could play a major role in the nomination contest.

Police in Chicago are saying that the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor slammed reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett, who is black and gay, says he was attacked while leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago on Jan. 29. He said two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him before beating him, throwing a chemical on him, which may have been bleach, and leaving a noose around his neck. He said that as they attacked him, at least one of them said, “this is MAGA country.”

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment. During the search of their home, police allegedly removed bleach, a black facemask, a red hat and an ""Empire"" script, according to CBS Chicago.

Gloria Schmidt, the brothers' attorney, told CBS News that she denied her clients’ involvement and noted that they worked with Smollett on the set of ""Empire"" and also know him from a local gym.

This week, two reports from ABC and CBS stations in Chicago, both citing unnamed police sources, have raised the possibility that Smollett staged the attack. A potential motive could be that Smollett was being written off ""Empire,"" according to ABC7Chicago. However, earlier this week police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed and that not only were they still investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime but that they considered Smollett a victim. The production company behind ""Empire,"" 20th Century Fox, also denied claims that Smollett was being written off the show.

Late Friday evening police released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them. Over the weekend, unnamed sources told ABC News and CNN that they believe Smollett allegedly paid the brothers to attack him.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement from Smollett's attorneys said.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack and Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, 14 OTHER STATES SUE TRUMP IN NINTH CIRCUIT OVER EMERGENCY DECLARATION: The attorneys general of California, New York, and 14 other states on Monday filed a lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit against the White House's recent national emergency declaration over border security, claiming President Trump has ""veered the country toward a constitutional crisis of his own making.""

Trump had predicted the lawsuit last week. He's slammed the Ninth Circuit multiple times as ""disgraceful"" and politically biased.

The litigation, brought before a federal trial court in the Northern District of California, seeks an injunction to prevent Trump from shifting billions of dollars from military construction to the border without explicit congressional approval. The suit also asks a court to declare Trump's actions illegal, arguing that Trump showed a ""flagrant disregard of fundamental separation of powers principles ingrained in the United States Constitution"" by violating the Constitution's Presentment and Appropriations Clauses, which govern federal spending.

KAMALA HARRIS GIVES AWKWARD RESPONSE WHEN ASKED ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT CLAIMS: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris appeared to be caught off guard Monday when she was asked about the latest developments in the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

During an appearance at a bookstore in Concord, N.H., a female reporter asked the senator from California if she wanted to amend a tweet from Jan. 29, in which she said Smollett was the victim of ""an attempted modern day lynching"" and called the actor ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" Harris has also used the Smollett attack to push legislation that would make lynching a federal hate crime. She now said that she will not comment on the case until we learn the outcome of the investigation.

Timothy Dean, 55, was found dead in Buck's apartment early on Jan. 7, 17 months after 26-year-old male escort Gemmel Moore was found dead of a methamphetamine overdose. The Daily Beast reported that Dean and Buck had a relationship years before Moore's death, but Dean's friends claimed the relationship turned into a one-sided affair -- with Buck sending multiple text messages to Dean and Dean declining to respond.

Did he actually think about, plan about, wearing a wire? Did he actually speak to or consider speaking to cabinet members getting their approval for the invoking of the 25th Amendment? That would be a serious movement toward an unconstitutional coup d’etat. – Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz on “America’s Newsroom,” on his belief that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were searching for a way to remove President Donald Trump from office.

It is also learned that for the remaining four scenes, he is no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he is flanked by a number of cast members.

Not only that, TMZ also reports that with his duties pared down, Smollett will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, he will be working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won’t be rehearsing.

An update to the Smollett’s attack case is that the case is heading to a Grand Jury as early as Tuesday and the focus is presenting evidence that could lead to a felony indictment against Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report."

Radio host and anti-extremism campaigner Maajid Nawaz has been hit in the face outside a London theatre, in what he described as a racist attack.

The LBC radio presenter said a white male attacked him while he was standing alone outside the Soho Theatre.

Mr Nawaz, 41, said the man approached him from behind and hit him in the face with “maybe a signet ring”, while calling him a “fucking p***”.

He asked not to be contacted, but thanked those who had offered their support.

Investigation launched

The Met Police said officers were called to a report of a racially aggravated assault at 7.10pm.

A spokesman said the suspect had fled the scene on Dean Street before officers arrived.

They added that no arrests have been made, but an investigation is ongoing.

Tracked down ‘life saver’

Mr Nawaz, is the founding chairman of Quilliam, an anti-extremism think tank which aims to challenge Islamist extremist views. He presents a radio show on LBC on Saturdays and Sundays.

The British-born Muslim used to be a member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which led to him being imprisoned in Egypt for four years.

He renounced Islamism and left the organisation in 2007 after spending time with members of Amnesty International, and now fights against his former views.

Last year he managed to track down a “hero” who he said saved his life 25 years ago during a racist attack in Essex.

Mr Nawaz, who was 15 at the time, was confronted by a group of skinheads in Southend who were carrying knives and hammers. The man who stepped into intervene was attacked and stabbed by the mob. Mr Nawaz said the man “saved me”."

Empire star Jussie Smolett has reportedly had his scenes cut down from the Fox musical drama following his brutal attack in Chicago last month.

The 34-year-old actor, who reported in January that he was set upon by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs as they beat him up in the early hours, was meant to take centre stage in the penultimate season five finale episode. However, this has now been changed.

Sources told TMZ: ‘Jussie was supposed to have nine scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode – which is being shot now – but five of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86’d.’

The publication also say that Jussie’s character Jamal Lyon is no longer the focus in the remaining four scenes, and his co-stars take the helm in one particular ensemble scene.

It’s been reported that because of these last-minute alterations, Jussie will be spending just two days on set rather than every day this week – and won’t be rehearsing either.

This comes just one week after Fox denied they are going to write Jussie’s character out of the show before the incident took place.

In a statement to People, they said: ‘The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous.

‘He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.’

Since the savage attack, Jussie has been forced to deny rumours that he ‘orchestrated’ it all, amid mounting speculation he may not be telling the truth about the incident.

Jussie’s lawyers said in a statement: ‘Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

‘It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.’=

It was also reported that Jussie will no longer be the main focus in the remaining four scenes as he would be flanked by a number of cast members.

To this end, Jussie will be spending way less time on set without rehearsal.

It was reported that Jussie Smollett, who plays the role of ‘Jamal Lyon’ in ‘Empire,’ will enjoy less screen time. This move, TMZ reports, is in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the widely reported attack on him."

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA Country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault. MKH

Have you sensed a pattern in the way stories like Jussie Smollett's hoax or the Covington kids' confrontation take over your social media? Do you read or listen to the news regularly, wondering in advance how each story can be spun? Is it increasingly frustrating to see facts distorted to bolster hate and fear? Have you been aware of pain you feel as you watched loved ones being fed lies by sources they trust? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you are the victim of emotional and philosophical warfare. There is a type of hostile tactic that's been given a new name: DARVO.

I reached out to Jeff Giesea, an entrepreneur and information warfare expert based in Washington, D.C. He describes DARVO as ""a tactic of abusers when confronted where they deny, attack, and then shift blame. The term came from studies of emotional abuse and sexual trauma, but DARVO behavior shows up in many contexts."" He also views it as ""a form of psychological warfare."" DARVO is a behavioral response that perpetrators use when met with their own wrongdoing. It is an acronym for Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. As Mr. Giesea puts it, ""DARVO is a gaslighting tactic to shift blame."" While the area of academic study on this response has been focused on sexual abusers in intimate relationships, it does happen on a much broader scale. It is a tactic of manipulation so broad that most people in the developed world encounter it on a daily basis just by looking at their smartphones. ""I'm frankly seeing significant DARVO behavior from the media towards Trump supporters. When the media genuinely screw up, they often shift blame instead of taking responsibility,"" says Jeff Giesea. Trump-supporters now find themselves in an abusive relationship with the ""free press"" and their own elected officials. Constant attacks on Trump and his base have become so normalized that any contradiction to that narrative seems only to fuel more attacks. That's because the social engineers need you to get upset. Once an idea has been propagated, and even if it's wrong or not even an argument, there's already been so much disruption in emotion and personal thought that it becomes easier and easier for the offender to successfully use DARVO. Mainstream news has mastered this art by using sensationalized headlines, or pushing stories that should be critically examined, to engage an emotional response in the reader. This has the immediate effect of the target being less likely to use rationality and judgment while reading. While involved in emotional processing, the reader might have contradictory thoughts himself or attempt to process other confusing stimuli, such as opposing argument that seems logical, causing him to lose trust in his own mind. You may have noticed it recently when the Jussie Smollett hoax finally unraveled, and media and pundits were forced to answer why they had so eagerly used an uncorroborated story to push their ideological agendas. The people who had first shown empathy for Smollett's story were not the least bit relieved that the actor they claimed to have love and support for hadn't been the victim of a hate crime. Instead, many denied that the revelation could challenge their stereotypes about Trump's base and used it as an opportunity to justify more villainization of MAGA-supporters. They claimed that the ""real victims"" were the ones now silenced by ""Trumpsters' giddiness"" over being vindicated that they weren't really what they had been misaligned as. Sen. Cory Booker was one of the first politicians to jump at Jussie's story and used it to push his anti-lynching legislation in the Senate. Even though no lynching occurred, even if Jussie had been telling the truth, Booker quickly related it to his own agenda anyway. When confronted by a reporter after the story of the hoax broke, Cory Booker immediately went into denial by saying ""information is still coming out."" Then he went on the attack by saying, ""Bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise."" This switched the roles of the actual victims of Jussie's crime, Trump-supporters, to victimizers, when he implied that the problem isn't hate crime hoaxes, but ""right-wing terror attacks."" Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. DARVO is not a new political strategy; charlatans have been using these maneuvers for millennia. Ancient Greeks knew them by the name Sophists, with the modern definition of sophistry being ""using information to deceive."" From Plato's noble lie to Machiavelli telling the prince he should be a ""great pretender and dissembler,"" it is used because it historically works. But that does not make this form of informational warfare morally right. The DARVO tactic has been used unremittingly by the Left, and Smollett's hoax response was only the latest attempt. When the Covington kids received a stream of hate-filled responses to a heavily edited condensed video, the media encouraged it with headlines like ""The MAGA Teenager Who Harassed a Native American Veteran Is Still Unnamed, but We've Seen His Face Before."" When the full context emerged, they did not re-evaluate their own response, but instead doubled down on their rhetoric, like this Emmy award-winning journalist who completed the DARVO circle by reversing Trump as the offender: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has employed DARVO to attack critics of her boyfriend being listed on her staff and being granted a congressional email account. Genuine concerns were raised about her boyfriend's access to the government, but the way the freshman congressman handled it was to deny: ""Congressional spouses get [this] access all the time."" Then she attacked a person asking the question, calling it ""nonsense."" The Washington Post ran the story under the headline ""Conservatives can't stop obsessing over Ocasio-Cortez. Their latest target: her boyfriend."" — implying that those asking about an ethical violation were somehow in the wrong. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was recently condemned by most, including her own party, for anti-Jewish remarks, but when the president was asked his opinion and offered that she should be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, she went full DARVO, responding to the president: You have trafficked in hate your whole life — against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more. I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you? The authors of a DARVO study tried to use Justice Kavanaugh and the Republicans as an example of the GOP engaging against accuser Blasey Ford, but in order for the technique to have been employed, Ford would have had to really be a victim first. But Kavanaugh was the victim as the Left actively tried to destroy his life with false attacks on his character, villainizing him, all while denying the blatant proof that Ford's accusations were completely unsubstantiated. It's not just individual victims and perpetrators, either. Mainstream media have hired some highly trained manipulators to use DARVO tactics on all GOP platform issues. Gun control by villainizing the people who just want to protect themselves, emotionally equating the right to bear arms with a desire to kill schoolchildren. Now, similarly, citizens who support the border wall are finding that they're being condemned as morally corrupt for their political view. ""Only racists want a wall."" According to the Left, if you don't like the idea of infanticide being legal in New York State, then you're really just a misogynist who wants to oppress women. This technique is used by social engineers who want you to react a certain way. By forcing people to question their own realities by introducing emotional arguments that don't connect to rational ones, they can harness individual self-doubt while disorienting and destabilizing opponents. When this is repeated constantly, the media can destroy some individuals' ability to make sound judgments to the point that they become submissive, just like actual abuse victims. This has the goal of making readers who are easier to emotionally charge for the next, probably uncorroborated, story that rolls across their newsfeed. There is a narrative being written of Trump-supporters by liberal media and folks who just cannot handle a Trump presidency. They are redefining his supporters as racist bigots, uneducated rednecks, deplorables and Russian bots. This is done not because there's any empirical data that support this, but so Democrats can feel morally superior while they blame their 2016 loss to Trump on issues sheltered in ambiguity. Jussie Smollett's political activism has been built on DARVO. He crafted his identity on social justice warriorhood and abusing people he did not agree with politically. However, he denied any evidence that would have shown him there is no correlation between racism and support for the president. He used music videos to displayed imaginary violence by Trump-supporters and profanity-laced tweets to attack the president and his base.

YouTube screen grab. When the MAGA hat–wearing bigots never actually materialized, he was so desperate that he manufactured a crisis that would manipulate people into believing he was the victim of the people he had spent years abusing. The good news is that you have defenses against this psychological warfare. You could confront the perpetrators with explanations of their own tactics, but remember: they want you sucked into their sociopathy. No contact is the preferred method for individual victims dealing with abusers and narcissists, but that's difficult to accomplish when the abuser is mainstream media. The one thing you can't do is expect that the media will correct themselves, even if it's just offering one line that fights their own imposed hysteria. The best strategy is to choose not to engage. In the same manner that you would treat a borderline personality parent or narcissistic emotional abuser, do not engage. If you do not react to their attacks the way they believe and intend that you will, these manipulative maneuvers will have no more power. Jeff Giesea suggests, ""The most important thing is to recognize DARVO behavior when it happens. Catch your breath and realize, this is what's happening and you are not going crazy. Then evaluate what to do from there."" Most studies on DARVO suggest that education is key to overcoming the infliction these mental manipulation strategies cause. Since we cannot unlearn information, being able to understand and relay what DARVO is, the more we will be able to recognize when someone is attempting to use this informational deceit on us.

Kamala Harris (Calif.); Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.); and Julián Castro, the Hispanic former HUD secretary and mayor of San Antonio, Texas, are three of the first ""people of color"" minority Democrat candidates to declare their presidential candidacies. All three are dyed-in-the-wool proponents of identity politics.

Rather than usher in a post-racial, more unified society, the presidency of Barack Obama exacerbated America's divisions in hot-button areas of race, ethnicity, and identity. A number of the Democratic Party's leading contenders to unseat President Trump in 2020 are already testing the political waters, and it is clear that their appeals to race and identity politics — echoing the Obama years — will play prominent roles in their campaigns.

Meanwhile, the story of black actor Jussie Smollett, whose claims of being the victim of a violent, racist, anti-gay attack on the streets of Chicago are now being seriously questioned as a fake hate crime, has unexpectedly pointed to a potential conspiracy involving two leading Democrats running in 2020, Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.). As Monica Showalter reported in American Thinker on February 18, there is a growing suspicion of possible collusion among Harris and Booker and Smollett and his handlers to exploit his allegedly faked attack for the benefit of the two Democrats' strategy to gain attention for S. 3178, an anti-lynching law in the Congress that they are pushing.

Kamala Harris

In a post on January 31, a ""founding member"" of politicalbullpen.com also posits this collusion scenario:

He [Smollett] is at Kamala's announcement party. Kamala has anti-lynching legislation that has stalled in Congress. She only has 3 bills that have became law and all are BS symbolic crap. All of a sudden, her gay black friend, has a lynching incident. Who knows when the last time something like this has ACTUALLY happened, especially in Chicago. Kamala puts out a tweet saying this is a ""modern day lynching"" and Congress needs to act. She doesn't mention HER legislation so it doesn't appear too obvious. Less than 1 hour later, Cory Booker tweets out about this ""modern day lynching"" using that exact phrase and says Congress needs to act.

The use of fake hate crimes has a long politically driven history. On February 18, Jamie Glazov, editor of Front Page Magazine, republished his November 2016 article on the phenomenon under a new title, ""Why Jussie Smollett Lied — And All the 'Hate-Crime' Victims Who Weren't; Totalitarian movements know how to portray themselves in order to gain power.""

Cory Booker

The Hill documented what Cory Booker is up to in a story on February 18, ""Booker seeks dialogue about race as he kicks off 2020 campaign."" Having officially declared his candidacy on February 1, with prominent mention that it was the first day of Black History Month, Booker is now moving quickly to position himself as the minority candidate best equipped to run a racially focused campaign.

The Hill:

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has put the topics of race and reconciliation front and center in his nascent presidential campaign. The early campaign themes are emblematic of growing calls among Democrats and progressives to address issues of discrimination and racial inequality at a time when support from minority voters is seen as crucial to the party's electoral success. He's talked about systemic inequality and the need to confront racism head on.

The Hill article quoted Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina–based black Democratic strategist who often appears on Fox News, who said about the N.J. senator's focus on race:

[I]t could help Booker stand out in an otherwise crowded Democratic primary field, especially in South Carolina, a crucial early-primary state where the majority of the Democratic electorate is black.

In a telling admission, another expert quoted by The Hill, Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist and former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said President Obama ""belonged to a cohort of black politicians whose campaigns and policies were race neutral.""

The Hill quoted this significant comment by Smirkle:

""He [Obama] made a tacit agreement with voters to not engage race, but the killing of Trayvon Martin, events in Ferguson, Dallas and Baltimore, put race front and center,"" referring to the high-profile killings of several unarmed black men and teenagers.

In fact, three of those instances — the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012; the killing of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014; and the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in Baltimore in 2015 — all quickly morphed into fake or wildly exaggerated events that were then used to advance divisive political memes in order to benefit leftist politicians. The desired result was achieved, in that the top news story of 2014 according to the Associated Press was ""the police killings of unarmed blacks.""

The longstanding but slowly healing wounds left by the legacy of slavery, which ended in the 1860s, and segregationist Jim Crow laws in the South, which ended in the 1960s, were ripped open again by the left's exploitation of the aforementioned ""killing[s]"" and ""events"" during the latter years of Obama's administration. Remember how Obama ""assertively inserted himself into the controversy surrounding the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin"" (as the Washington Post put it), one month after Martin's death, when he said during a high-profile appearance in the White House Rose Garden, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon""?

Julián Castro

For his part, Julián Castro, the third minority candidate to declare for 2020, is in the thick of racialist identity politics, as he always has been. On February 4, Breitbart published a detailed 11,200 word examination of Castro's career, titled ""Identity Politics and Class Warfare Define Julián Castro 2020 Campaign.""

It is here, in identity politics with racial tinges and leftist grassroots organizing, where Castro feels most at home, those familiar with his rise to national prominence tell Breitbart News, as his mother was an early leader in hard-left organizations like La Raza. ""He is absolutely an extreme leftist,"" James Dickey, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party, told Breitbart News radio on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel for a special report on Castro. ""That's the background his mother comes from, and that is what he has been and done consistently in every chance he's gotten the opportunity to and in his announcement for running for the presidency. That's what he said he would do."" ""Their [Julián Castro's and his brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro's (D-TX)] mother was very, very active, not just as you said in La Raza, but actually in Chicano separatist movements,"" Dickey added in the Breitbart News interview. ""That really doesn't at all respect our heritage or our country or the incredible melting pot that has been the United States and the welcoming environment that we have been for immigrants for a century or more."" Dickey is correct that Castro's mother, Maria del Rosario Castro, or Rosie Castro, was a major leftist organizer who co-founded La Raza Unida, an extremist third party separatist group in the 1970s. La Raza Unida literally translates to ""The Race United,"" and the group sought to create a new country in the American Southwest called Aztlan. Breitbart News has run a number of pieces over the years on this group and the Castro family's connections to it, but perhaps the most interesting thing about Castro's presidential campaign launch is that he did not shy away from this radical upbringing; he embraced it.

As I reported in an analysis of Castro on January 15, one half of his presidential campaign announcement speech on January 12, 2019 in San Antonio was delivered in Spanish.

Immediately after news of the purported attack on Smollett, Castro issued a variety of tweets, including this one on January 29:

1/ I'm grateful to hear that Jussie Smollett is reportedly in good condition. I hope he fully recovers. I'm not sure many of us ever will. In 2019, he was violently attacked because of his race and sexual orientation. Unfortunately, he is not alone.

A protest in El Paso

Connecting the dots on what's happening here leads us to a not unrelated article in the Washington Examiner on February 18, ""Protesters take over Border Patrol museum, deface pictures of fallen agents."" The protesters wore masks and meant business.

Dozens of demonstrators occupied and vandalized a privately owned U.S. Border Patrol museum near El Paso, Texas, over the weekend, according to the site's top official. Museum director David Ham told the Washington Examiner his staff and guests worried for their safety Saturday when a group of about 50 rowdy protesters entered the facility, defaced property, and refused to leave the grounds. ""Say it loud, say it clear, Border Patrol kills!"" group members standing inside and outside the facility yelled. The group, which calls itself Tornillo: The Occupation, livestreamed the protest.

The money quote in the article about the El Paso ""protest"" is this:

One of the protest organizers, Elizabeth Vega, was previously involved in demonstrations in Ferguson, Mo., following the police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014.

Vega, whose Twitter account describes her as a ""Chicana poet, mother, grandmother community artist, activist,"" manages to get around. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on April 3, 2018:

Prominent St. Louis activist Elizabeth Vega was reported to be among several people arrested Tuesday at a protest in Memphis. Vega was identified by The Guardian as one of eight people taken into custody during a demonstration against immigration detention outside the Memphis jail. Protesters have been gathering in the city to mark the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr's assassination, which is Wednesday. King was fatally shot at a Memphis hotel.

And so it goes.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was also part of the plan, allegedly offering to “wear a wire” to record the lunatic rantings of President Trump to use as justification to nullify the results of the recent presidential election. The latest is that two more Trump cabinet members may (or may not ) have signed on to the coup.

Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky, published in 1866, explored the theme of morally justifying crime for its greater good and benefit to society. Fast forward 150 years from Russia to the American political deep state, where similar righteous themes are playing out.

Someone from the New York Times might call this patriotism, acting out of a higher moral calling to stop someone unfit and unsuited to be president, an outsider not from the establishment club. As Trump once said of himself during the campaign, he was an “existential threat” to the deep state establishment. “Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt establishment with a new government controlled by you the American people.” A clear and present threat to the Deep State.

Others will call McCabe’s actions a coup, a treasonous attempt to subvert an election. Then having failed, ramped-up effort to remove a duly elected president from office, either by impeachment or by considering invoking the 25th Amendment.

Former FBI Director James Comey, an integral part of this coup attempt, wrote a book entitled Higher Calling: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, a title justifying his transgressions for the so-called greater good to society. His greater good was suppressing justice when it suited him and his establishment peers by ignoring or suppressing the legitimate investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illegal handling of classified email. This evolved into subverting justice by initiating a FISA warrant and spying -- first on a presidential candidate, then president -- based on unverified political opposition research presented to a FISA court as verified intelligence.

McCabe’s book is entitled, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. Again, justification for criminal activity for the greater good -- FBI, mom, and apple pie. McCabe seemingly portrays himself as Efrem Zimbalist Jr., who played an honest FBI agent in the TV series. Instead, the real FBI leadership sought only to protect itself from revelations of its treasonous attempt to overthrow a president.

Enter the creation of a special counsel to run interference and cover up FBI/DOJ evil. After all, they never thought Trump would win the election. How better to keep the dirty deeds under wraps than by blocking any and all inquiry under the blanket of “an ongoing criminal investigation”?

Where is the reckoning for this? Treasonous activities have so far led to the perpetrators being fired, but not much else. This is not a proper reckoning. They write books, make media appearances to promote their books, appear on cable news shows, and flaunt their defiance on social media. None are behind bars or being prosecuted (yet). That seems to be reserved only for Trump associates like Paul Manafort, still in solitary confinement.

The players in this coup are not only McCabe and Comey, but also Clapper and Brennan, as well as second tier FBI and DOJ officials including Strzok, Yates, Page, Ohr, Baker, and others. One can’t leave out the ring leaders of this entire cabal of corruption – Clinton and Obama. Aside from Obama, who elected them? Justice and intelligence officials are unelected and have no mandate to carry out the will of the people. Only Donald Trump now carries that mantle.

The Clinton’s have a long list of illegalities and scandal, dating back to their days in Arkansas. Flash forward to Hillary Clinton’s illegal home-based email server containing hundreds of thousands of emails, many highly classified, ending up on the laptop of sex-offender Anthony Weiner. And available to whoever had access to that laptop, whether the Chinese or the Muslim Brotherhood, the group Weiner’s wife Huma’s parents are affiliated with.

The FBI covered this all up, for expediency, as they didn’t want to open a criminal investigation into their future boss, who the media magpies stated unequivocally would win the 2016 election in a landslide.

How many top FBI and DOJ officials lied to Congress during hearings over the past two years? I thought this was a crime. Robert Mueller sure thinks lying to Congress or the FBI is criminal. Ask Flynn, Papadopoulos, or Cohen.

Where is the reckoning on this illegal behavior? Why is justice meted out based on politics, and not instead blind to political considerations as represented by a blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales of justice? She also carries a sword, representing punishment. The modern Lady Justice seems to wear a pink pussy hat and holds a tilted scale in one hand and a book contract in the other.

The National Institute of Justice discusses deterrence: “The crime prevention effects of the threat of punishment.” Does anybody in the Deep State truly believe they are about to be caught and punished? Quite the opposite, actually. They are busy repeating their lies on cable news show and social media, writing and selling books with fawning media adulation.

Some say there is panic in DC and that pain is coming, but where is the evidence of that? Are Huber and Horowitz cleaning up the corruption or just rearranging the furniture?

Aside from the Deep State players, the media is culpable as well. Rather than reporting the news objectively, they immediately frame the story to fit their preconceived narrative and prejudices. From Jussie Smollett to the Covington High School students. From “hands up don’t shoot” to the Duke lacrosse team. They have spent countless hours reporting and writing “Trump-Russia collusion” stories, ignoring the inconvenient fact that the House and recently the Senate Intelligence Committees say “nyet” to the collusion hoax, whipping up the public into a frenzy.

The media and deep state actors must be punished for their role in this entire fiasco. Punished legally where laws were broken, whether lying to Congress, leaking classified information, or committing treason. And certainly, in the court of public opinion. Comey, McCabe, Clapper, and Brennan should be treated as pariahs for what they did. Treated as Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, or Kevin Spacey, not heroes of the motherland, lauded over on 60 Minutes or CNN panels.

Think of the time and resources wasted on what Trump correctly described as a “witch hunt.” Obamacare wasn’t repealed and the border wasn’t secured despite two years of a Republican-controlled Congress because of the Russia hoax. The GOP didn’t expect Trump to last a year in office because Adam Schiff and CNN said he wouldn’t. A once in a generation opportunity squandered over a lie, perpetrated by those in high positions of public trust.

The reckoning and punishment must be so severe that no one dares try this again. Criminal prosecution where warranted and public humiliation. Crime and punishment.

Otherwise evil wins out over honor, justice, and decency. A message needs to be sent loud and clear. As President Trump said,

The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exist for only one reason, to protect and enrich itself. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.

This injustice must be acknowledged and the guilty must be held to account. From the top on down, from Obama and Clinton, to the top tier at the FBI and DOJ, to partisan Democrats and NeverTrumpers, to their cheerleading media.

Crime and punishment. We are at a crossroads. It’s time. If not now, then when?

Either Jussie Smollett faked his beating or the two guys he paid $3,500 upfront with 5 C-notes to come later decided to attack him for his generosity.

Kamala Harris tweeted, ""This was an attempted modern day lynching.""

You would think they could at least agree upon whether it was a modern day or modern-day lynching.

These two scare me as potential presidents because if the Russians launch a space probe, Booker or Harris may rush to the conclusion that the probe is a nuclear weapon and bomb the modern-day world to kingdom come or kingdom-come.

And they say Trump worries them?

Nathan Phillips claimed that the Covington Catholic School boys surrounded him threateningly. He also claimed to be a Vietnam vet.

""You know, I'm from Vietnam times. I'm what they call a recon ranger,"" he said. ""That was my role."" Phillips actually served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1972 to 1976 as a refrigerator technician. This makes him a stone-cold liar.

The Washington Post backed up his story until it didn't. Democracy aches in fakes and dies in lies.

Elizabeth Warren tweeted, ""Omaha elder and Vietnam War veteran Nathan Phillips endured hateful taunts with dignity and strength, then urged us all to do better[.]""

Does Warren contend that we should all lie with dignity and strength like Phillips and herself?

For two years, Andrew McCabe lied multiple times to federal investigators.

That was the authorized conclusion in February 2018 of a scornful 39-page report by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General.

Yesterday, McCabe was the big-time guest prevaricator on 60 Minutes to promote his book deal and to trade falsehoods with whoever hosted the segment. A real modern day (or modern-day) lie-fest featuring deception, dishonesty, and corruption — bet you're sorry you missed it.

The lies pile up — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says the world will end in 12 years unless we rid the world of, I don't know, cows, cars, trains, planes, weathervanes. I'd be impressed, but Al Gore said the same thing over twenty years ago, and Chicken Little spoke a variation of this theme to the Grimm Brothers back in 1811.

These days, if you want to know whether the new is fake, simply check the source.

Jussie Smollett's ""Empire"" screen time is getting slashed in the wake of a growing sentiment that he staged the so-called ""attack.""

Production sources tell TMZ ... Jussie was supposed to have 9 scenes and a big musical number in the second to the last episode -- which is being shot now -- but 5 of his scenes have been cut, and his musical number has been 86'd.

As for the remaining 4 scenes ... we're told he's no longer the focus. The scene features an ensemble, meaning he's flanked by a number of cast members.

With his duties pared down, Jussie will be spending way less time on set. Instead of working every day this week, we're told Jussie's working Friday and possibly Thursday, and he won't be rehearsing.

Less work for Jussie means more work for writers, who are busy making edits. In the past 24 hours, we're told the script has undergone multiple revisions."

On Sunday, the Bronx-based rapper uploaded an Instagram live video where she, while eating lobster, pondered the latest developments in the unpredictable and divisive case.

'I am really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*** his name is. I'm really disappointed in him.

'I feel like he f***d up Black History Month bro. Like damn. I'm not going to say yet until he said out his mouth at it was fake and staged, I don't want to completely blame him because you know like somebody, that I was talking to, they said that police in Chicago are racist so they might try to frame him and make him look like he's a liar, but if he's not then bro you f***d up for real.

'Why would you do that? Then you f****** give Donald Trump immunity to f****** laugh at n*****s and s**t,' she said.

Some said they were waiting for more information before passing judgement again, and others questioned the integrity of the Chicago Police Department which has a historically racist reputation.

'Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t,' said director Ava DuVernay.

Cardi B uploaded an Instagram live on Sunday night where she accused Smollett of 'ruining Black History Month'

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts.

Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack - something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers - or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had 'shifted' - that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police 'are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.'

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

'And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,' Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push 'the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.'

Andy Lassner, a producer on the Ellen show, shared this tweet on Sunday after Smollett was accused of staging the attack

Director Ava DuVernay shared her view that while there are inconsistencies, she could not unreservedly trust the Chicago Police Department

Author Roxane Gay also commented on the quickly shifting narrative surrounding the story

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted her tweet posted on the evening of the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett

Al Sharpton, who was among those who condemned the attack, denied that it was a 'left wing hoax' because the President had also spoken out against. Sharpton shared two videos on Twitter on Sunday about the incident and said if Smollett was found to have orchestrated the attack, he should be brought to justice

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a 'mess' and a 'travesty.'

'I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,' Gay wrote. 'The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.'

Smollett, shown in a file image, maintains his version of events

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a 'modern-day lynching.' On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment 'until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.'

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she 'can't blindly believe' the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: 'Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.'

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

'I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,' Gay wrote. 'Because more often than not they are telling the truth.'"

(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)

Why designate a crime a “hate crime?” After all, isn’t an assault an assault or a robbery a robbery regardless of the identity of the victim or perpetrator? What purpose does the designation serve?

The progressive/media narrative is that hate crimes not only abound in America, but are increasing with a purported upswing in racism and white supremacy in the era of Trump. Perpetuating that narrative, politicians from Kamala Harris to Joe Biden to Corey Booker to Nancy Pelosi immediately denounced the alleged racist and homophobic attack on actor Jussie Smollett; news anchors lamented that such things seem commonplace in 2019. Proliferating gangs of racists were running rampant throughout the land.

But facts confound the narrative. FBI statistics for 2015 (the most recent available at the time of the 2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Hate Crimes Hearing ) show that there were 1,997,700 violent crimes in the U.S. A total of 5,850 crimes were designated hate crimes — whether violent or non-violent. There were 15,696 cases of murder or manslaughter in the U.S., of which 8, or .0005, were designated hate crimes. There were 764,449 aggravated assaults, of which 681, or .00089, were designated hate crimes. There were 124,047 rapes, of which 12, or .000096, were designated hate crimes. There were 327,374 robberies, of which 120, or .00036, were designated hate crimes.

Despite media flogging, there’s little credible evidence of an appreciable increase since then. In 2017, nearly 90 percent of reporting police departments registered zero hate crimes in their respective jurisdictions. True, not all hate crimes are reported. But neither are non-hate crimes. Moreover, not all incidents designated as hate crimes are motivated by animus toward the victim’s identity, and that’s not counting hoaxes or dual-motive cases.

Another fact that frustrates progressives’ hate-crimes narrative is that MAGA-hat-wearing white males aren’t disproportionate perpetrators of hate crimes. Not even close. The most recent data show that blacks are more likely to commit hate crimes than whites. And not by a margin of 5 percent or 10 percent. Not even by as much as 25 percent. Blacks are approximately 200 percent more likely to commit hate crimes than whites.

During the aforementioned U.S. Commission on Civil Rights hearing on hate crimes I posed two simple questions to a panel of witnesses consisting of criminologists, law-enforcement officials, and hate-crime experts:

“Are you aware of any data, studies, or other evidence that shows that designating a crime a hate crime deters, prevents, or reduces that crime, and second, whether designating a crime a federal hate crime reduces, deters, or prevents incidents of that crime?”

Advertisement

There was complete silence. So I asked a third question:

“Then, one other question, are you aware of any databases, study, or other evidence that shows designating a crime a hate crime, whether municipal, federal, or state crime, assists in the resolution of that crime or the apprehension of that perpetrator?”

Crickets.

So, if designating a crime a hate crime doesn’t deter, prevent, or resolve such crime, what’s the purpose of the designation?

By now, most Americans are getting a pretty good idea.

The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media. But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

Why should anybody be baffled by this? Anybody who has paid any attention to the news — presumably, AP reporters do that — must know that the staging of fake hate crimes is a commonplace occurrence, a lamentable trend for which dozens of examples can easily be cited.

And, “conservative pundits have gleefully seized” — on what? The facts? Isn’t the Associated Press in the business of seizing on facts?"

According to sources cited by gossip portal TMZ, Smollett had chosen the place - outside his Chicago apartment - for the ""assault"" and had told the brothers not to rough him up too much.

Smollett, 36, reported to the police on Jan 29 that two men had yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck while he walked downtown in Chicago.

The police have since said that their investigation had ""shifted"" after talking to the alleged attackers, who were released.

They intend to conduct a follow-up interview with the actor.

ABC News reported that Smollett had staged the attack, paying the two men, because he was upset that a threatening letter he had received earlier had not been treated seriously by the authorities."

Jussie Smollett is facing fresh claims his attack in Chicago has been ‘staged’ and having her say on the situation, Cardi B has told fans she is ‘disappointed’ in the Empire star if the reports were true.

The 36-year-old was set upon at the end of January by two masked attackers, with reports stating the ordeal was being treated as a ‘hate crime’ as racial and homophobic slurs had been hurled at Jussie during the incident.

It was reported he was ‘beaten up, a noose was put around his neck, and bleach was poured over him’.

Two suspects were arrested but later released without charging and a police spokesperson confirmed to Variety that the ‘trajectory of the investigation has shifted’ following their interviews with the two men.

The former suspects – who have denied they are racist or homophobic following their release – were claimed to have known Jussie, with reports suggesting one worked on Empire, while both knew Jussie from the TV series.

Reports then followed alleging Jussie had ‘paid the men to orchestrate the attack’, but he has strongly denied this.

Commenting on the ordeal, Cardi said she is ‘really disappointed’ with the star during a live stream on Instagram.

She said: ‘So, I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the fuck his name is. I’m really disappointed in him.

‘I feel like he fucked up Black History Month, bro. I’m not gonna say… yet. Until he says out his mouth that it was fake and this shit was staged. I don’t wanna completely blame him.’

But, she also suggested that the Chicago Police Department might be trying to ‘frame’ Jussie and ‘make him look like a liar’.

Metro.co.uk have contacted a rep for Jussie.

Chicago police are re-questioning Jussie over the attack so they can ‘verify details’ of what happened.

A rep for Jussie has dismissed claims he ‘staged’ the incident and said in a statement: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

‘He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

Fox have also stood behind Jussie and insisted claims he ‘staged the attack to keep his job’ on Empire are ‘patently ridiculous’.

According to our sources, some of the people who were in the room during the interview felt the validity of Smollett's story was ""up in the air"" after his conversation with Roberts. Our sources say when Smollett and his team left the room after the interview was completed, there was immediately a feeling among the ""GMA"" staffers that something about Smollett's story was amiss.

We're told the interview came about because Smollett approached ""GMA"" about doing the sit-down, which was a very coveted interview to score. Our sources say Smollett specifically requested Robin Roberts for the interview because the two had a history together — Roberts appeared on an episode of ""Empire"" that aired in April 2018.

Roberts played herself in the episode, which also featured an appearance by Lupe Fiasco (who also played himself).

Our sources say Roberts questioned Smollett about the alleged attack many ways but he was adamant he was the victim of a hate crime. As one source put it, everyone one wanted this interview and regardless if it was CBS, NBC or even CNN, he would have been treated the same. ABC just landed the interview.

Roberts addressed the controversy behind the interview on Monday's episode of ""GMA,"" saying, ""When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened.""

She continued, ""And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.""

According to a report out of Chicago, police believe Jussie Smollett was upset about the lack of reaction to a threatening letter he received at Chicago’s Cinespace Studios, where “Empire” is filmed, the week before the alleged attack. The outlet quoted a source as saying, “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.”

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical Left and Islamic terrorism.

Why did the media fall so swiftly for the Jussie Smollett hoax right after falling for the Covington Catholic hoax? The easy answer is bias. And that might have even been the right answer a generation ago.

These days the media isn’t biased. It’s tribal.

Bias leads us to make mistakes. But the media wasn’t making a mistake when it loudly broadcast false claims with plenty of red flags about Trump supporters wearing red hats. Just as the media wasn’t making a mistake when it spread fake news about attacks on Muslim women by Trump supporters after the election. This wasn’t an error due to prejudice, but an active effort to reinforce tribal prejudices.

The Covington Catholic story in particular was not newsworthy by any rational definition of the term. The media insisted on making it news because it perfectly encapsulated the tribal prejudices of its base of urban and suburban lefties by pitting anti-abortion kids in MAGA hats against saintly minorities.

There’s another example of tribal hatred masquerading as news in the news now.

Prime Time Sports, a small sports memorabilia store in a Colorado Springs mall, announced that it was going out of business. Malls are emptying out across the country and there was no reason why the closing of a mall shop selling Cubs t-shirts and Patriots mini-helmets should have ended up in hundreds of papers around the country. But the reason why its closing ended up in major papers and news networks, including CNN. says a great deal about the malicious nature of political tribalism on the Left.

""A Colorado store that boycotted Nike after its Kaepernick ad will close,"" the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gloated about the misfortune of a mall store 1,400 miles away.

""He stopped selling Nike products because of Colin Kaepernick,"" the Washington Post breathlessly reported. ""Now his store is closing.""

The fate of a 2,000 square foot hole in the wall placeholder in a dying mall had somehow become of crucial interest to the opinion-shapers and policymakers of the nation’s capital. But when Kermit Gosnell, the abortion doctor suspected of hundreds of cases of infanticide, was on trial, the Post dismissed it as a “local crime” story. Those are the same tribal priorities that led the media to be outraged that Governor Northam wore blackface 34 years ago, but not that he now backed infanticide.

The headlines sum up why the national media found the closing of a mall shop so newsworthy. The owner had dared to buck the media’s tribal message that Colin Kaepernick was a civil rights hero. Going out of business was his punishment. It was a story of just deserts. A moral lesson for America.

Stand up to our social justice mega-corps and we will destroy you. And then dance on your grave.

Stories of ordinary people punished for their political views have slowly become a staple of the media. These often focus on some random person caught on video in what can be spun as a politically incorrect moment during a confrontation, and then being followed around by the cameras as their lives are destroyed. The Covington Catholic case is the most famous of these types of tribal humiliation stories.

Their existence says everything about where the media, its parent leftist movement and America are.

In a liberal society, people from different tribes can agree to disagree because they recognize their mutual humanity. In a tribal society, the ‘other’ is less than human. Tribal narratives are about the superiority of ‘our’ people to ‘their’ people. Outrage at selective incidents is used to dehumanize the ‘other’ tribe, to call for violence against them, and then to urge their utter destruction.

Or, as New York Times columnist Sarah Jeong once tweeted, ""#CancelWhitePeople"".

Tribal superiority is reinforced through ritualistic acts of humiliation of the other side. Media stories like the one about a sports store in a failing mall going out of business ‘count coup’ on conservatives.

Once upon a time, America was a liberal society. And Americans were able to coexist together.

It’s easy to see what we have lost by what we now have. A tribal society is governed by mysteries and absolutes. Morality is relative and contradictory. The only real absolute truth is the superiority of the group. Divisions between tribes are therefore absolute. Unity is possible only against a common enemy.

And so we’ve lost science and replaced it with scientism. Science was a set of techniques for testing the accuracy of answers. Scientism is the conviction that anything a politically correct PhD says about the entire planet or the universe must be believed with a religious fervor because it makes you a more moral person.

Religious tolerance and tolerance for all different ideas have also become casualties.

In a tribal society, the other tribe is evil because of its ancestry and beliefs. These two are intermingled, as they were in Nazi Germany or among the leftist exponents of ‘white privilege’. Your tribe is superior because of its ancestry and beliefs. The enemy tribe is evil because of its race and its beliefs.

Racial tolerance has been replaced by racial tribalism. Coexistence is held to be a physical impossibility. The new racial theorems claim that ‘whiteness’ and ‘blackness’ are in perpetual conflict, and that racial justice can only come by recognizing this conflict and doing everything possible to destroy ‘whiteness’.

There’s nothing progressive about this narrow-minded tribalism. Instead the ‘progressives’ have destroyed what was once a liberal society while declaring that their tribal hatreds and prejudices, their intolerance and refusal to listen to other points of view, are justified by tribal outrage and grievance.

All other forms of morality and justice have been supplanted by the tribal representation of ‘diversity’.

Tribal warfare begins with outrage, it escalates to raids and then to war. The media is already saturated with the tribal outrage of victimhood. The purpose of outrage is to declare something unacceptable. Media tribal outrage depicts almost any conservative views as unacceptable causes of tribal suffering. Every day, conservative views are responsible for the murder and oppression of minorities. Like Colin.

The next step in the tribal war is the raid. The raid is a brief skirmish that inflicts harm and humiliation on a tribal foe, demonstrating his weakness and the strength of the raiders. It raises the morale of the tribe, encouraging it to embark on a conflict, while weakening the morale of its targets to resist.

The media has been conducting these tribal raids for some time now. Over time the intentions behind them have become more explicit. Stories that reinforce the tribal conviction that conservatives are morally inferior give way to stories that seek to economically and even physically punish conservatives.

The journalists tweeting about Nick Sandmann of Covington Catholic and his “punchable face” were demonstrating that the ultimate purpose of tribal narratives about the evil of the ‘other’ in his MAGA cap is to escalate that outrage, demonstrations of inferiority and ritual humiliations into violence.

The deluge of disgust, contempt and hatred is a tide that can only wash up on one bloody shore.

Different tribes can coexist in a liberal society, they can separate in a federation whose divisions are governed by strict rules, or, hatred and anger will funnel them into an escalating tribal war.

The media is the voice of the leftist tribes reinforcing their identities, policing their boundaries and stirring up hatred, outrage and violence against the rest of the country. It lets no incident pass it by that it can use to stir up more tribal enmity, whether it is a boy in a red cap in Washington D.C. or a mall store closing in Colorado Springs. It has become the greatest enemy of a tolerant and open society."

Trump nominates Jeffrey Rosen for deputy attorney general

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday nominated Jeffrey Rosen to be the next deputy attorney general.

Rosen is currently the deputy transportation secretary and oversees the department’s day-to-day operations.

He also served as general counsel and a senior policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2006 to 2009.

Rosen previously worked as a senior partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP — the same law firm as the new attorney general, William Barr.

The current deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, is expected to leave his post in March. His departure had been expected after Barr was confirmed last week.

Rosenstein had overseen special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. Barr now oversees the remaining work in the Russia probe.

TERROR WATCHLIST

APNewsBreak: Feds share watchlist with 1,400 private groups

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — The federal government is acknowledging that it shares its terrorist watchlist with more than 1,400 private entities, including hospitals and universities.

The admission is prompting concerns from civil liberties groups that people placed on the list by mistake could face a wide variety of hassles in their daily lives.

The government’s admission comes in a court case challenging the watchlist’s constitutionality. It follows years of insistence that the list is generally not shared with the private sector.

The watchlist is supposed to include only those who are known or suspected terrorists but contains hundreds of thousands of names. Critics say the watchlist is wildly overbroad and mismanaged, and large numbers of people are wrongly included on the list and suffer routine difficulties and indignities because of their inclusion.

CALIFORNIA-HIGH SPEED RAIL-THE LATEST

The Latest: California governor accuses Trump of retribution

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom says the Trump administration is engaging in “political retribution” by trying to take back $3.5 billion granted for the state’s high-speed rail project.

The Democratic governor says President Donald Trump is reacting to California suing over Trump’s emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump linked the two together Tuesday in a tweet that referenced the lawsuit and said California “has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train.”

Newsom says California won’t sit “idly by” and will fight to keep the money.

The federal money comes with certain requirements that the Trump administration says California won’t meet. The state has already spent $2.5 billion on the planned train between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK-THE LATEST

The Latest: Smollett gave false information in 2007 case

CHICAGO (AP) — A California misdemeanor complaint against Jussie Smollett shows the actor was accused of identifying himself as his younger brother in 2007 when a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The misdemeanor complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in September 2007 says that Smollett gave the name of his brother, Jake Smollett, when he was asked by an officer. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court. Smollett also was later charged with false impersonation, driving under the influence and driving without a valid license.

Court records show Smollett pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of giving false information, in addition to driving under the influence and driving without a valid license counts. The records show he later completed an alcohol education and treatment program and completed the terms of his sentence in May 2008.

The details of the complaint were first reported by NBC News.

AP-US-TRUMP-SAUDI-ARABIA

House Dems probe White House handling of Saudi nuclear plan

WASHINGTON (AP) — A new congressional report says senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials.

The Democrat-led House oversight committee launched an investigation Tuesday into the claims.

The committee says whistleblowers within the Trump administration raised concerns about “abnormal acts” within the White House to support the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom.

The investigation comes as lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the U.S. technology is transferred without proper safeguards.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

MEXICO-MIGRANT CARAVAN

Mexico closes temporary migrant shelter near US border

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Officials in the northern Mexico border state of Coahuila say an empty assembly plant used to house about 1,600 Central American migrants during the past two weeks has closed.

Jose Borrego, a state spokesman, confirmed the closure of the Piedras Negras shelter Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled. He said additional information would be made available later.

The shelter’s population had been steadily falling since last week as migrants who had obtained humanitarian visas were given bus rides to other cities where they could have a better chance of finding work.

The migrants arrived at the border hoping to request asylum in the United States, but Mexican authorities corralled them in the shelter and only about a dozen were allowed to request asylum each day.

DISMEMBERED TEEN

Man pleads guilty in rape, murder of Pennsylvania teen

DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania man has pleaded guilty in the rape, murder and dismemberment of a 14-year-old girl, and the victim’s adoptive mother has agreed to plead guilty and serve a life sentence.

Jacob Sullivan pleaded guilty Tuesday to first-degree murder in the 2016 death of Grace Packer. A jury outside Philadelphia will determine a sentence of either life in prison or death.

Grace’s adoptive mother, Sara Packer, is expected to testify against Sullivan during the penalty phase of his trial. Officials say she intends to plead guilty in the case.

Prosecutors have said that Sara Packer, a former foster parent and child welfare worker, watched Sullivan act out a rape-murder fantasy they shared. The couple allegedly stored the girl’s body in cat litter for months, then dumped it in a remote area.

This story has been corrected to show Grace Packer’s adoptive mother is Sara Packer, not Sarah Packer.

R KELLY-INVESTIGATIONS

Legal hurdles would look familiar in any new R. Kelly case

CHICAGO (AP) — Prosecutors will have to clear a series of high legal hurdles if they intend to charge R. Kelly anew and convict him, even if there’s video evidence.

Speculation the R&B star could face new charges arose after attorney Michael Avenatti said he recently gave prosecutors a VHS tape showing Kelly having sex with an underage girl, although it’s not clear when it allegedly was recorded.

Amid allegations of sexual misconduct dating back years, Kelly has always denied any wrongdoing.

A case that well illustrates the challenges to prosecutors is Kelly’s own 2008 trial at which he was acquitted.

The alleged victim did not testify. Jurors said after acquitting Kelly of all charges in 2008 that they had difficulty convicting someone when the alleged victim herself didn’t testify.

OBAMA LIBRARY-LAWSUIT-THE LATEST

Latest: City lawyer welcomes decision on Obama library suit

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago’s lead attorney says the city is pleased a federal judge will expedite hearings on a lawsuit challenging the planned construction of the Obama Presidential Center in a South Side park.

Responding to U.S. District Judge John Blakey’s order Tuesday allowing the Protect Our Parks lawsuit to proceed, Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel said he is glad the judge dismissed some of the lawsuit’s claims.

Blakey tossed the plaintiffs’ claim that their First Amendment rights would be violated if tax money is used to construct a building to promote former President Barack Obama’s political interests.

He also found no merit in the plaintiffs’ claim they would suffer because of aesthetic and environmental harm to Jackson Park.

Blakey says his ruling “does not address the true facts of this case.”

BURBERRY APOLOGY

Noose knot on Burberry hoodie pulled amid fury

NEW YORK (AP) — The luxury fashion house Burberry has apologized for putting a hoodie with strings tied in the shape of a noose on its London Fashion Week runway.

The knotted strings surfaced after Sunday’s show when a model hired to walk but not wear the outfit complained.

Model Liz Kennedy wrote the strings evoked both lynchings and suicide. Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti said in a statement Tuesday the look was intended to reflect a nautical theme.

Kennedy’s Instagram post has prompted dozens of negative comments directed at Burberry and its creative director, Riccardo Tisci. Tisci apologized.

Gobbetti said he called Kennedy to apologize as soon as he became aware of her concerns on Monday. Kennedy said the global brand should have known better.

The rapper expressed her frustration at the case on Instagram Live Monday, Feb. 18. She said she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but that she was “disappointed” if he had lied.

“I’m really disappointed in him, bro. I feel like he f*cked up Black History Month, bro,” she said. “I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the sh*t was staged.”

“I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to they said police in Chicago are racists. So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you fucked up, for real. Like, why would you do that?”

She recalled a road rage incident two years ago during which police reportedly put her into a headlock. Police reportedly harassed her and her family into giving a statement. When she did not talk to police, she said a police statement was released stating that she had staged the incident to promote an album that was not yet in the works.

Other black celebrities have also spoken up on developments in the case. Director Ava DuVernay continues to stand up for him.

Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD. The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one?

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,” DuVernay tweeted yesterday.

“The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Staged attack?

Police said they want to interview Smollett again after they released two Nigerian men considered as potential suspects.

READ: Chicago police seek follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett

Smollett claimed that at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, two men attacked him and placed a rope around his neck. They also allegedly yelled homophobic and racist slurs at him.

In the investigation that followed, Chicago police said there was no footage of the attack.

Sources told CBS News in a Feb. 14 report that the men were paid $3,500 to stage the attack. They rehearsed the attack with Smollett days before. The men left for Nigeria on Jan. 29 and were promised $500 when they returned.

Smollett’s lawyers denied reports that the attack was staged. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a press statement said.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

His lawyers said that he does not plan to speak with police for another interview. /ra

According to TMZ, the two brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo told cops they got in a car with Jussie and scouted a location, settling on the one right outside the actor's apartment. The brothers said Jussie chose the spot because he believed a camera would have captured the action.

The police also report that Jussie Smollett asked the brothers not to attack him to the point where he would be badly bruised.

The brothers also claimed that on the night of the attack, even though they were nervous, they acted accordingly. At some point, a car drove by and they felt someone had spotted them.

It would be recalled that the police had kicked off an investigation into the alleged attack on Jussie and the home of the two Nigerian brothers was searched. In the coming week, a grand jury will preside over the case in Chicago.

Police raids home of persons of interest in Jussie Smollett's assault case

Jussie Smollett's assault case is being investigated by the Chicago Police Department

The police in the United States of America are questioning the two people of interest involved in the assault case on Jussie Smollett. According to TMZ, the two men who are of Nigerian heritage were said to have flown out of the country the night after the attack on the Empire star. However, the said men returned to the US on Wednesday, February 13, 2019.

The police then took a swipe on the residence of the two men and a number of items of special interest including 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops, and others were seized by the police.

They included a handful of local TV reporters and crime blog CWBChicago, who in turn appeared to be passing on leaks from Chicago police strongly suggesting that, behind the scenes, investigators doubted the story.

They did not include most of the national and international media, journalists, politicians, celebrities and activists who accepted Smollett’s claims, in many cases denouncing sceptics as “conspiracy theorists”.

More often than not, the word “alleged” was nowhere to be found in the reporting.

Smollett, who plays a gay singer on the Fox drama Empire, said the two men — one of whom was wearing a red hat — called him a “f****t”, “n****r” and yelled, “This is MAGA country!” during the alleged January 29 attack.

The actor’s story now appears to be falling apart, with reports police believe he paid two friends — Nigerian bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo — to stage the assault and even rehearsed it in the days prior.

Smollett’s lawyers have rejected those claims, saying he is “angered and devastated” by the allegations. Chicago police said on Sunday they were seeking a follow-up interview with Smollett after information gleaned from the brothers in a gruelling two-day interrogation “shifted” the focus of their investigation.

While no one has yet been charged, many conservatives have already used the incident to decry yet another “hate crime hoax”.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad, and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter.

“The elephant in the room for media malfeasance discussions is that many reporters are simply not smart,” said Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist.

“They fall for hoaxes easily. Over and over and over again. They are obviously not well read. That this is combined with a completely unwarranted arrogance compounds the problem. They uncritically accepted ‘MAGA thugs roving Chicago, attacking celebrities’.”

Radio host Jesse Kelly joked, “The key to a good ‘victim’ hoax is starting small. Write something racist on your restaurant receipt. Draw a swastika on your own house (this is known as ‘The LeBron’). You gotta crawl before you can walk.”

In the wake of the 2016 election, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Centre and the Anti-Defamation League — criticised by many conservatives as partisan political operations — reported a surge in hate crimes.

According to FBI statistics, hate crimes in America have been rising since 2016 but are still well below the all-time high in 2001 following the September 11 terror attacks.

While many reported hate crimes are genuine, others are conveniently difficult to pin on a suspect — racist graffiti, for example, is particularly common — or are self-reported with no corroborating evidence.

And then, of course, there are the large number of proven hoaxes, some of which are listed below. The vast majority of these cases were reported in national and international media at the time they first occurred, typically with some reference to the US president.

Naturally, they received much less attention when they turned out to be fake. In some instances the event never occurred as reported, while in others the culprit turned out to be the alleged victim.

The statistics become even more hazy when you take into account many of the perpetrators were charged with crimes. In at least three of the cases listed below, follow-up media reports either played down or omitted the ethnicity of the perpetrator of the “racist” graffiti.

Cases like these make conservatives naturally suspicious of reports such as Smollett’s and highlight why journalists should exercise caution when reporting on hate crimes — or at least remember to say “alleged”.

• In December 2018, 21-year-old black lacrosse player Fynn Ajani Arthur was arrested over a spate of racist graffiti around Goucher College in Towson, Maryland. The graffiti, which included swastikas, “KKK” and appeared to target four black students — including Arthur himself — sparked protests at the campus.

• In November 2018, 26-year-old James Polite, a black Democratic activist who had worked on city initiatives to combat hate crime, was arrested for scrawling “Kill All Jews” and “Hitler” inside a Brooklyn synagogue, less than a week after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

• In September 2018, 19-year-old Long Island woman Adwoa Lewis claimed to have been accosted by four teenagers who yelled “Trump 2016!”, slashed her car tyres and left a note reading “Go Home”. She was charged after admitting to making up the incident.

• In November 2017, a black Kansas State University student admitted to scrawling racist graffiti on his own car, including the words “Go Home”, “Date your own kind” and “Die”. Police said charging 21-year-old Dauntarius Williams with filing a false police report would “not be in the best interests of the citizens” of the local community.

• In September 2017, the US Air Force Academy Preparatory School in Colorado Springs made national headlines after five black cadet candidates found the words “go home n****r” scrawled outside their room. Two months later, the school revealed the perpetrator was one of the students allegedly targeted.

• In March 2017, Israeli police arrested a 19-year-old “hacker” over a series of bomb threats against Jewish community centres in America that raised concern about rising anti-Semitism. Michael Kadar was last year sentenced to 10 years in prison for the hoaxes.

• In December 2016, 18-year-old Muslim woman Yasmin Seweid claimed three drunk men on a New York subway yelled “Trump! Trump!” and called her a “terrorist” as they tried to steal her headscarf. She was later charged with filing a false police report.

• Earlier that month, 18-year-old Drake University student Kissie Ram was charged after allegedly faking a series of “racist notes” found around the Des Moines, Iowa campus. She was charged with filing a false police report in connection with one of the notes.

• Also in December 2016, a student at the University of Michigan told police she had been approached by a “white male” who “demanded she remove her hijab or he would set her on fire with a lighter”. Police cancelled the “ethnic intimidation” crime alert after determining the “incident did not occur”.

• In November 2016, a Muslim student at San Diego State University reported being assaulted and robbed by two men who made comments about president-elect Trump. Police scoured surveillance video but came up with no suspects. They later said her initial report of a stolen car was unfounded as she had forgotten where she parked. The case was dropped “because the victim no longer wants to co-operate”, a police spokesman said.

• Also in November 2016, an 18-year-old student at the University of Louisiana admitted she made up a story about being robbed by two men, one of whom was wearing a “Donald Trump” hat, who hit her, knocked her to the ground, yelled racial slurs and stole her wallet and hijab.

• Just before the US election, a black church in Mississippi was burned down and spray-painted with “Vote Trump”, in a crime widely reported as a “hate crime” tied to suspected “white supremacists”. Andrew McClinton, a 45-year-old African-American member of the church, was later charged with arson over the incident.

• The same month, days after the election, an Indiana church was vandalised with anti-gay, anti-Semitic slurs including a swastika and the words “Heil Trump”. The church’s organ player, 26-year-old gay man George Nathaniel Stang, later confessed to the crime, telling police he wanted to “mobilise a movement”.

• Around the same time, “openly bisexual” Chicago university student Taylor Volk claimed to have received hateful emails and notes taped to her door containing homophobic slurs and the words “Back to hell” and “#Trump”. North Park University later said the claims were “fabricated”.

• Still in November, an African-American woman’s viral Facebook post about a shocking racist encounter at a gas station also turned out to be fake. Ashley Boyer claimed she was accosted by “four caucasian males” who “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with a n****r much longer”, but police denied the story.

• In another post-election viral Facebook post, University of Minnesota student Kathy Mirah Tu said she was physically attacked by a “white male” who yelled at her to “go back to Asia” before police arrived and handcuffed her. Police said they had no record of such an incident.

• The night of the US election, filmmaker Chris Ball said he was attacked outside a Santa Monica bar by Trump supporters yelling, “We have a new president f****t.” Local police said they had “not received any information indicating this crime occurred”, but the 25-year-old insisted it was not a hoax.

• Also immediately after the election, racist graffiti reading “Trump Rules” and “Black Bitch” was spray-painted across storefronts, cars and homes on a South Philadelphia street. Two days later, 58-year-old African-American William Tucker was charged with vandalism and related offences.

• In September 2016, Eastern Michigan University was hit with racist graffiti, including the letters “KKK” and “leave n*****s”. More graffiti appeared over the next few months. A black former student, 29-year-old Eddie Curlin, was later charged over the incidents.

• In April 2016, an unnamed 20-year-old woman claimed she was walking down a Manhattan street wearing a headscarf when she was slashed in the face by man who called her a “f***ing terrorist”. She later told police she slashed her own cheek.

• In June 2015, racist flyers were left outside a predominantly black church in Colorado Springs, with references to the KKK and the words, “Black men beware, you are the target.” Police arrested 44-year-old Vincent Broughton, who is black, over the incident.

CHICAGO -- Attorneys for ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett say there are no plans for him to meet with Chicago detectives Monday for a follow-up interview about his reported assault.

Anne Kavanagh is a spokeswoman for Smollett's lawyers. She says in an emailed statement that his lawyers ""will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.""

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He said they also yelled he was in ""MAGA Country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they've requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett's lawyers say the actor feels ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault."

“Hello, CNN? This is conservative media guy Michael Graham — and I’m calling to report a hate crime! I was walking to the South Station Diner at 2 a.m. for some hash and eggs when this gang of millennial thugs jumped me! They were wearing #ShePersisted T-shirts and they were shouting, ‘This is Ocasio-Cortez country!’ Why are you laughing? Hello? Hello?”

If you think the media look stupid in hindsight for pushing the ‪Jussie Smollett hate crime story, you’re mistaken. Once you know the details of the deranged fantasy Smollett was apparently spinning, it’s obvious to anyone with an IQ higher than Samantha Bee’s ratings, the media were acting like morons the entire time.

Smollett’s story was never believable. Ever. Not because hate crimes don’t happen to gay, black men. Sadly, they do. But here’s what doesn’t happen:

Walking out of a Subway sandwich joint late on one of the coldest nights in Chicago history, Smollett says he was randomly set upon by two men who just happened to know who he was, just happened to know he’s gay, and just happened to have a noose and a bottle of bleach with them, because why wouldn’t they?

And so, with a shout of “This is MAGA country!,” they attacked. (Fact check: Hillary won Chicago with 84 percent of the vote). Sixty seconds later, Smollett and his still-intact sub sandwich were on their way home. It took him 40 minutes to even call the cops.

Now, as a normal, non-media American, what’s your reaction to this story? The kindest word is “improbable,” right? Ah, but you’re not a credentialed member of the Fourth Estate.

This attack is “yet another reminder that Trump’s ascendance and the resulting climate of hate has meant that lives have been increasingly at stake since 2015,” wrote Karen Attiah, an editor at The Washington Post.

“Anyone who thinks supporting You Know Who isn’t tantamount to providing artillery for weaponized bigotry needs to take a hard look in the mirror,” wrote the Daily Beast’s Kevin Fallon.

CNN and MSNBC hosted seemingly around-the-clock roundtables blaming President Trump and his racist, homophobic supporters as villains in a story they never doubted.

Much has been made of comments by the 2020 Democratic POTUS candidates jumping on the hate-crime bandwagon — both Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker called it a “lynching” — but their only mistake was trusting the media.

The New York Times’ Sopan Deb complains that blaming the media is unfair because “most outlets reported what was happening,” namely that the Chicago cops were investigating and said they didn’t doubt the story.

This appeal to authority (hey, we just reported what the guy said) might work if 70 percent of the news coverage they feed us every day didn’t feature the phrase “Trump falsely claims …” When CNN/MSNBC are running chyrons during Trump news conferences calling the president a liar, they can’t suddenly declare, “Hey, who are we to say what’s true or false?”

Which brings to what the Smollett story is really all about: attacking Trump.

The only reason this bogus story (law enforcement sources told CNN that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the alleged assault) from a borderline celeb wasn’t dismissed as ridiculous was because it gave the Trump-hating propagandists posing as reporters a chance to smear the president. It’s the same reason the press packed former Gov. Bill Weld’s speech in New Hampshire last week. Weld has as much chance of being the GOP POTUS nominee in 2020 as, well, Jussie Smollett. But Acosta & Co. don’t care. Weld’s campaign means more Trump bashing, so they’re all in.

The irony is that, at a moment when there are so many legitimate reasons to criticize Trump, the media keep delivering self-inflicted wounds to their own credibility."

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

It is astounding that so many reputable people took Smollett’s fantastical account seriously. Certainly, hate crimes based on race and sexual orientation are a very real thing, but the details surrounding this particular episode centered around a lampoonish representation of a Trump-era bigot.

It was a flimsy yarn from the outset, which only became more precarious with each passing day. That didn’t stop those most deeply invested in the narrative of Evil Trump to jump into action.

Presidential hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris each labeled the supposed attack a “modern-day lynching,” with Harris adding that, “We must confront this hate.”

Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted, “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it …”

Joe Biden tweeted, “What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

It wasn’t only those with presidential aspirations who weighed-in, Democratic-Socialist superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez railed against news accounts that qualified their reporting. “There is no such thing as ‘racially charged,’ She tweeted. “This attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack … It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.”

Another freshman congressman, Rashida Tlaib, tweeted, “The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is killing & hurting our people.”

Not to be outdone, Hollywood notables also reacted as expected. Director Rob Reiner tweeted, “The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving. No intolerance! No DT!”

The media has comported itself badly as well. Almost immediately after getting the Covington Catholic story so wrong, many in the news industry immediately accepted the Smollett story as true.

Astonishingly, a Washington Post writer named Nana Efua Mumford wrote this: “If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue … The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ‘fake news.’ And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true.”

In other words, Trump supporters are violent, murderous racists. That dark premise is a lie, fake news and untrue. Let us hope one half of the country can correct their horrifically jaded view of the other half before we lose ourselves.

Politicians, newsmakers and other influencers must take the lead."

On Monday night, The Daily Show host became the first in late-night to tackle the bizarre Smollett case in depth—one that began with Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by a pair of racist, homophobic Trump supporters on the streets of Chicago who, after recognizing that he was the black gay actor on Empire, assaulted him, poured bleach on him, tied a rope around his neck, and yelled, “This is MAGA country,” but which is now said to be a hoax.

“Now it seems maybe there’s a lot more to the story,” Noah explained. “That’s right, the police now believe Smollett staged his own attack—which would be insane, but you have to admit, there’s a certain part of the story that was always a little weird. Like, who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch Empire? Like, I’ve heard of hate-watching but that shit would be next-level. That’s like a member of the Klan buying tickets to Fiddler on the Roof.”

Indeed, the most recent reports suggest that Smollett staged the Jan. 29 attack, paying the two men $3,500 to help, after a racist letter with a mysterious white powder he received on the Empire set didn’t get a big enough reaction from the media.

“So now it’s being reported that Jussie Smollett paid a couple of guys to fake this attack. But who’d accept money to do such a thing? These guys,” offered Noah, before throwing to a news report on the Nigerian brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, the men allegedly paid by Smollett. Olabinjo served as a background actor on Empire, while Abimbola is reportedly Smollett’s personal trainer.

“Hold up, wait… so Smollett’s Nigerian personal trainer is one of the guys who beat him up? That doesn’t make sense—unless his trainer was just really pissed off that Smollett was eating Subway,” joked Noah. “This story is so weird. I don’t care who you are, this is a weird story, because now they’re saying that Jussie rehearsed the attack a few days before it happened. And look, I’m not gonna lie, that’s the one part of the story that actually makes sense to me, because if I was paying these two to beat me up”—he then threw to a picture of the men shirtless, flaunting their abs—“I would want to practice too.”

Noah continued: “So in the public eye, this story has moved from a hate crime against a popular TV actor to a giant hoax by a popular TV actor, but Smollett still insists there was ‘no collusion.’”

The comedian then played a clip from Smollett’s interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, wherein the actor cried while describing the “attack,” and speculated that the perpetrators would likely never be found.

“OK,” said Noah, “either this guy’s telling the truth, or he deserves an Emmy for that interview, because if all of that is just a performance, I don’t care what he’s lying about, you can’t cancel him. He’s just too good to not be on TV.”"

Trompe l'oeil featuring a 'diving board' and 'water' has been created by artist 3D Joe and Max to commemorate games

It stands in the former athletes' quarters of East Village, Stratford, and invites passers-by to pose as part of artwork

It's a well-known rule that paintings should be looked at, not touched - but this innovative piece of artwork is breaking all the usual rules.

This eye-catching creation depicting some of London's most iconic landmarks invites passers-by to jump, flip or even dive-bomb into the artwork to re-live a bit of the Olympic spirit.

The trompe l'oeil, which was created to commemorate the second anniversary of the London 2012 Games, allows would-be swimmers to 'stand' on the board and 'peer' into the water, in the manner of British diver Tom Daley.

The 22-year-old also performs a hand stand, right, on the piece of work, which has been created in East Village, Stratford



It stands in the former athletes' quarters at East Village, Stratford and includes sights such as the Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Park, Canary Wharf and the biggest stars of the Games, including Bradley Wiggins, Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis.



The creation comes from Joe Hill, founder of 3D Joe and Max, an artistic duo which has become internationally-renowned for its vibrant 3D street art.

Mr Hill, from Holloway, north London, said: 'The picture isn't finished until there's a person in it.'

Mr Hill and Max Lowry began travelling all over the world around nine years ago, creating realistic scenes to brighten up pavements for pedestrians.

Their work - which is often created for live events, marketing campaigns, music videos and TV commercials - has included fantastical scenes such as raging waterfalls, fiery depths and plunging canyons.

Since Mr Lowry died in 2010, Mr Hill decided to continue the pair's work, keeping the name 3D Joe and Max in his partner's memory.

His recent work includes extending The Solaris Building in Singapore by four levels and creating a futuristic city for Motorola in London and Barcelona.

The artwork, shown here in its infancy, will be on display for the next week and is said to capture the 'changing skyline and vibrancy of the area'

In November 2011, 3D Joe and Max broke the Guinness World Record for the World’s Largest and the World’s Longest Anamorphic Artwork at West India Quay, London for Reebok Europe.

In 2012, the duo won an award in the Global Marketing category at the Marketing Society Awards for Excellence for Visit Britain’s GREAT campaign, a world tour of ten cities promoting tourism to the UK in the lead-up to the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics in 2012.

Tony O'Reilly, the East Village operations director, said the work, which will be on display for the next week, captured the changing skyline and vibrancy of the area."

Hamilton won eight of the final 11 races as he collected his fifth world crown last year, equalling Juan Manuel Fangio’s haul and moving to within two of Michael Schumacher‘s record.

Rosberg, the last driver to get the better of Hamilton in 2016 before promptly retiring, expects the likes of Sebastian Vettel and new Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to be strong contenders.

But speaking ahead of the Laureus World Sports Awards, the German suspects his old rival, who begins pre-season testing at Barcelona on Monday, will reign supreme once more.

“Lewis is the absolute favourite again because he’s driving incredibly lately and his team does an incredible job,” Rosberg said.

“He’s one of the most successful F1 drivers of all time, one of the most successful sportsmen of all time.

“I think the odds are in his favour then Sebastian is the obvious challenger. But I would also, if I was a betting man, say Leclerc or Verstappen because I think both of them can be a big, big surprise this year.”

There has been some technical tweaks in the off-season, which includes teams having a new front wing design that F1 bosses hope will lead to tighter races.

Rosberg said: “There’s an huge opportunity for things to switch around this year. Maybe suddenly Red Bull is the team to beat, that’s possible.

“It’s really put everything back in time and everybody has to start from scratch again, it’s really exciting because nobody knows where the teams are going to be.”

Rosberg thinks the pressure may be on compatriot Vettel this season after finishing runner-up to Hamilton for a second successive year.

Vettel has been the undisputed main man at Ferrari since switching to the Italian marque four years ago but he has failed to add to the four world titles he won at Red Bull.

A series of uncharacteristic errors undermined his efforts last year and, with highly-rated Leclerc now his team-mate, Rosberg believes his former rival needs to deliver.

Rosberg added: “The Mercedes car was the best car in all those years, except maybe for the last time where it might have been equal.

“In all the years, Sebastian is still one of the best drivers out there, he just had a poor season last year and made a lot of mistakes but the team also made a lot of mistakes.

“It was a joint effort and they all did bad, that can happen, but they need to turn it around this year.

“If Sebastian does a season like last year then Leclerc will end up in front of him at the end of the year. Sebastian needs to nail it this year.”

Anne Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Smollett’s lawyers, said in an email to The Associated Press that his lawyers “will keep an active dialogue with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett reported last month that he was physically attacked by two men who allegedly yelled homophobic and racial slurs. He claimed the men poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

He said they also yelled he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Police say they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett.

Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

But the Rev. Al Sharpton said that Smollett should face “accountability to the maximum” if he lied about the attack.

“I, among many others when hearing of the report, said that the reports were horrific and that we should come with all that we can come with in law enforcement to find out what happened and the guilty should suffer the maximum,” Sharpton said Sunday night on his show “PoliticsNation” on MSNBC.

He added: “And if it is that Smollett and these gentlemen did in some way perpetuate something that is not true, they ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

The outspoken civil rights leader addressed recent reports that the alleged assault on the black, openly gay “Empire” actor may have been staged with two bodybuilding brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo.

The Chicago Police Department released a statement Saturday night saying information from the brothers had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” Chicago police said this weekend.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement late Saturday saying Smollett was “angered and devastated” by reports that he knew the people associated with the alleged attack.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Chicago police say the FBI is assisting in part of the case."

Colorado Republicans

Be kinder to Colorado’s Republicans. Most would not have nominated Trump. Colorado Republicans did not support Trump at the national convention. Colorado didn’t help elect him. I don’t think all Colorado Republicans are all in on Trump. He lost in 2016; he’ll lose again in 2020.

Jussie Smollett

Since you ran a sizeable story about Jussie Smollett’s alleged attacks by MAGA hat-wearers, and now it appears that that was a total hoax, I hope you will cover this development as thoroughly as the original. When this gay black actor tries to fake a hate crime, it hurts all of us and wastes the time of the law enforcement folks. …

Declaration of emergency

President Trump, in his own words, said that this border crisis, that he keeps claiming is a crisis, is not an emergency. And yet he is diverting money from fighting true emergencies to build a wall that was merely a campaign promise. If you can’t believe his own words that it’s not a crisis, that it’s not an emergency, then just keep believing that it’s OK for us to divert money from our military, from FEMA, from all sorts of other places that truly need that money. I think it’s sad. I think it’s appalling.

Trump claims refugees in tennis shoes are an emergency. Lucky for America, Trump wasn’t president during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. JFK forced Khrushchev out of Cuba. Do you think Trump could push Putin anywhere?

Lawsuits

I am unhappy that the Democratic people are forever bringing lawsuits and attorneys and everything else into this Trump administration. They’ve done so for the last two years. The money saved could maybe be used to ensure legal immigration.

Bozell began by calling out the similarities between how the liberal media attacked the Covington kids after the release of a deceptive video and how they latched onto what were already dubious claims by Empire actor Jussie Smollett:

Didn't we just see this movie play about a month ago ahead called Covington? Didn’t we see the exact same thing where somebody made an accusation, in this case, an altered video? And you saw the triumvirate of radical left-wing Hollywood, radical left-wing news reporters, radical left-wing politicians all jumping on the bandwagon to blame not just the President, but his supporters for participating in racist activities. Here we go again.

To drive his point home, Bozell cited MRC studies of the Smollett hoax hate crime and the very real 2017 Facebook Live torture of an autistic white man at the hands of black teens. Between January 29 and February 14, the broadcast networks spent 101 minutes on Smollett’s accusations. When the Facebook Live torture incident first broke, only CBS Evening News covered it with a mere 27 seconds.

Further MRC research published later on Monday night found that Facebook Live torture was there and gone in just four days with the networks spending just 24 minutes on it.

Bozell concluded by demanding to know where and when the liberal media were going to apologize to President Trump and his supporters for smearing them:

Why don't they start condemning themselves? Why isn't there a conversation about these same reporters, these same Hollywood people, these same politicians all jumping on the bandwagon? Why isn't there a story about them? Why aren't they apologizing? Why are they not apologizing? Where are the apologies to the President? Not just from Smollett but all these people who put gasoline on the fire. When are they going to apologize to the President for what they’ve done to him and to his supporters?

A statement was released where the cops said, ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released."" On the same, Smollett's attorney claimed that while the actor will cooperate with the police, he did feel victimized as the police suggested he had any role to play in his attack. The cops are still seeking a follow-up interview with Smollet and Guglielmi has declined from commenting on the published reports that claim the cops to believe that Smollett staged the attack.

Just barely a month ago, a racially-charged attack on Smollett sparked national outrage as he stated the people attacking him shouted racial and anti-gay slurs. Celebrities and politicians all came in support of the actor on social media. The black and gay actor had stated that two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs had attacked him and yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" - a reference to the slogan used by President Donald Trump for the Make America Great Again election campaign.

The 45-year-old reality star could barely contain his unbridled anger and hurt when asked about the 36-year-old singer and actor's possible deception.

'I'm praying to everything sacred and holy that it's not a hoax,' he told TMZ on Monday while out and about in Los Angeles.

Not having it: Shahs of Sunset's Reza Farahan, 45, could barely contain his unbridled anger and hurt when asked about 36-year-old Empire star Jussie Smollett's possibly faked attack; shown in October

The openly gay reality figure was visibly upset at the possibility that Jussie's attack might have been a hoax.

'It's inconceivable to me that someone who is a minority, who is gay, who has made it, could do something like this, because he sets us all back,' he said.

'I really connected to the story because obviously I'm gay, I'm a minority, I'm half this, half that.'

Reza's biggest worry was that people might discount future racist or homophobic violence due to a boy who cried wolf scenario.

'Honestly, the thing that scares me the most is that I don't want people to discount other people in the future,' he continued.

'What if someone is attacked, what if someone who's African American is attacked, what if someone who's gay is attacked, what if someone is attack, I don't want people to think immediately, 'Oh this could be a hoax,'' he added.

The Iranian-American's anger rose to the surface as he continued speaking.

'We should always believe the person who is the alleged victim. But people like him f*** it up for all the other people who are legit suffering. F*** you, dude! How could you do this to people?!'

Boy who cried wolf: 'What if someone is attacked, what if someone who's African American is attacked, what if someone who's gay is attacked, what if someone is attack, I don't want people to think immediately, 'Oh this could be a hoax,'' he added; Jussie with Tyler Perry (M) and Esai Morales (R) on January 21

Beyond his fears for how a possible hoax might affect society, Reza felt personally hurt.

'I'm devastated. I feel like, personally, he f***ed me up because I stood up for his a**,' he said.

He also made it clear he wouldn't be tuning into Empire anytime soon if the attack turned out to be faked.

'I'm done, I'm done. Like never ever. If this is a hoax and he f***ed us up like that, I'm done, literally.'

Hell no: As for whether Jussie will have a career if it turns out he faked his own assault, the reality star was in favor of something far more severe; Reza (R) pictured with the cast of Shahs of Sunset in 2013

As for whether Jussie will have a career if it turns out he faked his own assault, the reality star was in favor of something far more severe.

'I think he should be criminally prosecuted,' he said. 'Like, every tax dollar was spent on surveillance or interviews or whatever. That b**** needs to go to jail, he needs to pay for every cent, and he needs to come out and apologize, and then move away.

'That's a punk-a** b**** if he did that stuff,' he added. 'That's f***ed-up, Jussie.'

According to TMZ, Jussie rehearsed the attack in advance and scouted out a location with Abel and Ola Osundairo, who were recently questioned by Chicago police.

They claimed the Empire star hired them to shout homophobic and racist insults and beat him up.

The actor apparently pointed to a security camera he had previously scoped out when he returned to the scene of the crime with police, but the camera was pointed in the wrong direction and failed to record the attack."

Back in late January, I told you that the hate crime allegations of actor Jussie Smollett just didn’t add up. Two guys wearing ski masks and MAGA hats just happened to be walking in Chicago, at 2 am, in sub-zero weather, with a noose and a bottle of bleach, and just happened to find Smollett? And…they just happened to recognize him? If this had happened in Atlanta or even Dallas, the story might have had tiny spark of plausibility. But Chicago? At 2 am? I don’t think so, Scooter.

The story has been unraveling rapidly over the past few days, as police tracked down two men, one of whom just happened to have worked with Smollett on the show ‘Empire’. The pair, Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, have said that Smollett paid them to carry out the attack. The pair are reportedly the men seen on surveillance video in the area where the attack allegedly occurred. And Smollett reportedly told police he was sure the men pictured were his attackers.

If all of this is in fact true, that he paid these two men to stage an attack on him, he deserves to be punished. Hundreds of police man hours have been wasted and racial tensions have been heightened, and all for what? On the surface, it all looks like an attempt to further smear President Trump and his supporters. Why else would you employ the MAGA hats and the references to ‘MAGA country’? As I have stated many times, there is nothing the left will stop at in their attempts to impugn the current administration and seize whatever power they can.

This leads us to yet another discussion: the media. The leftist, mainstream media wasted little time in weeping for Smollett and not even questioning the validity of the charges. Whatever happened to investigative journalism? We basically were told that we had to believe the charges no matter what. You see, in the eyes of much of the media, the 'Me Too' movement and 99 percent of the Democratic (Socialist) Party, if the victim is female, or black, or gay, or any combination of these, and you question their accusations against anyone, then you are ""anti-this"" or ""something-phobic"" and are therefore subject to being ridiculed and marginalized. As of the publication of this commentary, Smollett was refusing to meet with Chicago PD and has reportedly hired a ""crisis management firm"". Interesting.

The Smollett case, just as we saw with the lies hurled about during the confirmation hearings of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year, serves to illustrate that not only will people lie about others, they will lie about themselves regardless of the implications and potential outcomes. The end justifies the means. I don’t know what you can count on to really come out of all of this, but there’s one thing you better not hold your breath on, and that’s the media admitting they got it all wrong and apologizing to those of us who now can say ‘I told you so’.

The younger brother of Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman has secretly spent $12million on a lavish eight-bedroom estate in Virginia, DailyMail.com can reveal.

Khalid bin Salman al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, bought the estate with cash in February last year using a front company, property documents show.

DailyMail.com has also discovered big spending al-Saud has blown around $8million while working as ambassador, chartering a luxury 767 jet which costs a staggering $30,000 an hour.

The revelations may prove embarrassing to the Arab country's regime which is implementing austerity policies on its subjects and in November last year Salman initiated a corruption crackdown on his fellow princes in November that allegedly recovered more than $100billion.

Al-Saud's 24,000square-foot home, known as Le Chateau de Lumiere or the Palace of Light, is located just 18 miles from Washington, DC, in Great Falls, Virginia and will certainly raise a few eyebrows.

The 28-year-old Saudi prince bought the property while he was still a student studying International Security Affairs at Georgetown University, before rising to the role of ambassador in April last year.

The true owner of the property was disguised behind a front company, Cutlass Properties LLC, used to make the cash purchase on February 17, 2017.

Cutlass is run by Robert Dunn, co-founder and managing director of Washington, DC-based Monument Capital Group.

According to Washington think tank The Gulf Institute, Dunn lived in Riyadh for several years and has enjoyed a long working relationship with the Saudi monarchy.

The think tank and a source with knowledge of the property deal said Dunn's company Cutlass acted as a front for al-Saud to purchase the property anonymously.

The Palace of Light was built by Iranian-American luxury developer Mike Mafi, who has built other homes in the Washington area.

The property boasts eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and a ballroom. A wine cellar in the home is pictured above

The home has three master suites, one on each floor. The second-floor master suite is 3,500 square feet, with a sitting area, his and her closets, a wraparound balcony and 16 chandeliers. A closet in the home - with space for dresses, shoes and other storage is pictured above

The property boasts eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and a ballroom according to the Washington Post, which ran a profile of the Palace a month before its sale.

The home has three master suites, one on each floor. The second-floor master suite is 3,500 square feet, with a sitting area, his and her closets, a wraparound balcony and 16 chandeliers.

According to the Post the lower level has 11ft ceilings, a home theater with a 200-inch screen, a card room, a wet bar, a basketball court, a workout room with a water feature, a massage room, a steam shower and a sauna.

The front doors are decorated in ornate gold-leaf and hand-forged iron and besides having three staircases, an elevator also runs to all three levels. There are eight fireplaces and two garages that fit six cars.

A video of the property posted on YouTube shows the luxurious pool and a pool cabana embellished with Corinthian columns and archways. Fire bowls surround the swimming pool.

Le Chateau de Lumiere received Home of the Year at the Great American Living Awards and was also honored twice more by GALA.

'All those mansions in Rhode Island played a major factor in the design,' Mafi told the Post. 'Privacy was the main thing.'

When he's not at home, al-Saud regularly charters a private Boeing 767 at a cost of $30,000 an hour, according to a source with knowledge of the deal

The customized plane (its interior is pictured above), which has 63 seats, a master bedroom and a 14-hour range, is currently on sale for $65million

The jet is managed by Swiss firm Comlux, although it is owned by the government of Kazakhstan for official use by the president

A bedroom on the plane features carpeted floor, two large beds, a bathroom, and shades to cover the windows

A source said that Comlux is trying to sell the jet (its interior pictured above), but al-Saud uses it 'from time to time'

Al-Saud is a former F-15 pilot who trained with the US Air Force in Mississippi. Analysis of al-Saud's recorded flights by the Gulf Institute shows the total cost to be an estimated $8million, or 267 hours

While living in style is very important to the Saudi ambassador, al-Saud also likes to travel in style DailyMail.com has learned.

The prince regularly charters a private Boeing 767 at a cost of $30,000 an hour, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.

Video obtained by the Washington think tank shows al-Saud disembarking from the plane after it taxied from the runway at Dulles Airport near DC in July last year.

The customized plane, which has 63 seats, a master bedroom and a 14-hour range, is currently on sale for $65million, according to German website Planespotters.net.

The jet is managed by Swiss firm Comlux, although it is owned by the government of Kazakhstan for official use by the president.

'He's been trying to sell it for years, but can't, so Comlux are chartering it out for him,' said the source. 'Khalid bin Salman uses it from time to time.'

Analysis of al-Saud's recorded flights by the Gulf Institute shows the total cost to be an estimated $8million, or 267 hours.

Al-Saud was appointed ambassador in April, 2017, replacing Prince Abdullah bin Faisal, who had served in the post since October 2015.

He also had two far flashier predecessors, Adel al-Jubeir, the well-connected former ambassador who is now the Saudi foreign minister, and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, another former fighter pilot who was close to the Bush family, often dubbed 'Bandar Bush'.

Bandar was known as a 'playboy prince' and lived large, once owning Hala Ranch, a 95-acre estate in Aspen valued at $135million in 2006.

At 56,000 square feet the property is bigger than the White House, and Bandar had a staff of 12 when he lived there.

It has 15 bedrooms, 16 baths, a private barbershop and beauty salon just off the master suite and enough space for a party of 450 people.

Bandar also owned a 2,000 acre country estate in England and the flamboyant prince often threw lavish parties at his residences."

“I come really, really hard against 45,” Smollett told “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts in an interview, speculating on why he was supposedly targeted for attack. “I come really really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Although the actor and historically frequent Twitter user hasn’t tweeted a single time since the Jan. 29 incident, here is one that hasn’t aged well at all.

On Jan. 20, Smollett tweeted a segment of a speech by Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez along with a slam on “45 and all his white hooded cohorts.” (RELATED: Donald Trump Jr., Others Slam Jussie Smollett, Media Coverage Surrounding Alleged Trump Supporter Perpetrated Hate Crime)

The “Empire” star has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was attacked Jan. 29 around 2:00 a.m. outside his Chicago apartment building by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, leaving him with a rope around his neck.

Insiders, however, say he met with brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo in advance to choose a location where a camera would capture the assault.

The incident took place outside of Jussie’s apartment, but the security camera was pointed the other way.

The brothers supposedly rehearsed the attack, and the sources claim Smollett asked the guys to get somewhat physical, but avoid serious injury.

The insiders went on to say that the two men were nervous the night of the assault, but carried out the plan, even making some “contact with Jussie’s face” that they insisted was “weak.” They couldn’t explain his bruising, as they did not intend to injure him.

Earlier, CBS Chicago reported that Olabinjo and Abimbola were paid $3,500 for their part in the attack. They left for Nigeria the night it happened, and were reportedly supposed to receive another $500 upon their return.

The men, who had been identified from surveillance video near the scene, were arrested Wednesday and held by police for two days. They were not charged.

Olabinjo has appeared on “Empire” as an extra. Jussie’s attorneys have also stated that one of the men had worked for the star as a personal trainer.

Now, TMZ says a grand jury could soon hear evidence in the case, and sources tell the site that the two men have agreed to appear, and have not been subpoenaed.

Jussie could be charged with filing a false police report, which is a felony, if the grand jury believes the story of the brothers.

On Saturday, Smollett's lawyers told “Extra” in a statement that Jussie was “angered and devastated” by reports he knew the attackers, and that he now feels “further victimized.”

While the Chicago PD says detectives would like to speak to Jussie again, his attorneys tell us, “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”"

TMZ cites law enforcement officials who allege the Empire actor rehearsed the attack against him days before the incident with Abel and Ola Osundairo, the brothers police brought in for questioning last week.

According to TMZ, the Osundairo brothers allegedly told cops they scouted a location with Smollett for the attack, which the actor wanted to make a “physical thing” but not too extreme where he’d be seriously injured. They purportedly chose a place near the actor’s apartment thinking the attack would be caught on camera. (It wasn’t, as the camera was pointed in the wrong direction.)

In a statement to Chicago’s CBS2, the brothers said, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Yahoo reached out to Smollett’s lawyers to comment on the report, but did not immediately receive a response. However, the actor’s attorneys denied Saturday he “played a role in his own attack.”

Sources inside the Chicago P.D. are floating a possible motive as to why Smollett may have staged an assault.

CBS2 cites multiple sources saying Smollett paid two men to carry out the assault because he was upset that the threatening letter sent to Fox studios in January didn’t get a “bigger reaction.” An insider said, “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack.”

ABC News reports the Osundairo brothers told authorities they helped Smollett orchestrate the attack after the actor became upset that the note threatening his life did not get enough attention.

Prior to these reports, Smollett’s lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson issued a statement that their client would not be meeting with police Monday, but that they “will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

It was rude and unsettling, he said, for a stranger to approach him and say that. He said his friends intervened.

Trejo said he pulled out his phone to begin recording after the man used an anti-gay slur. In an eight-second video, the man appeared to want to confirm one thing. “Are you gay, though?” he asked Trejo.

AD

“Oh, I am,” Trejo said. The man shot back: “Oh, then you are gay.” Then he squared up his arms.

AD

Trejo answered, “Yeah, but you called me a …” before the man cut him off with a swing.

The man landed a blow on Trejo’s upper arm, he later said. Trejo’s phone sailed to the ground as several onlookers gasped. The man was picked up before police arrived and before Trejo gave a report to police, Trejo said.

Trejo posted the video on Twitter, appealing for help in identifying the alleged attacker. “I want people to be safe,” he said. “Nobody wants to feel unsafe in their town.”

The suspect is cooperating with the investigation, the Salt Lake City Police Department said on Twitter, where they posted Trejo’s video. Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski also posted the video.

The detective assigned to the case did not return a request for comment. It is not clear how police located the suspect or what role the video played in the search.

AD

The incident comes amid scrutiny about a high-profile hate crime investigation involving actor Jussie Smollett. The “Empire” actor said that after he left a restaurant in Chicago last month, two men assaulted him because he is black and gay. But after questioning and releasing two people of interest without charges, police said new information has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

CNN, citing unnamed police individuals, reported that police are exploring the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the assault.

AD

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, rejected the report. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” they told CNN in a statement. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

AD

Trejo said that as “a queer person of color” he was concerned the assault would prompt similar doubts about his own story. His mother and friends advised him to be careful as news of the incident spread, he said. But the difference here, he explained, was that he had video of the incident paired with witness accounts.

Utah state Sen. Derek Kitchen (D), the sole openly gay member of the state legislature, cited the alleged assault as further impetus to advance hate crime laws in Utah. “It’s time for the UT Legislature to act on hate crimes legislation,” Kitchen wrote on Twitter.

AD

State Republicans have held up the bill, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported. No convictions have occurred under current hate-crime legislation, according to the paper.

Trejo said the video has been difficult to watch, but he hoped releasing it would provide a sense of accountability.

“We live in a digital age,” he said. “People will know what you did.”"

First, they cause (usually) minority populations to fear for their lives needlessly. People have every good reason to be scared if, say, it appears that someone is hanging nooses around to intimidate them. If there is no shadowy, violent and racist power making such overt displays, then what special place in hell can be reserved for the person who would make others believe there is one, and to fear for no reason? This result, all on its own, justifies throwing the book at those who fake hate crimes.

Second, hoax incidents cause people to be suspicious of their neighbors. In falsely convincing people that there exists a large, hostile, and potentially violent population in their midst, it breeds distrust and divides communities. If the goal is to make people hate and distrust each other, hoax hate crimes will do the trick.

Third, these hoax incidents cause everyone to view all hate-crime incidents, including the ones that turn out to be real, with cynicism and disbelief. This is a natural result of people seeing so many high-profile incidents that turn out to be hoaxes.

There are two key things you can do in order to avoid these three negative outcomes. First, obviously, don't fake hate crimes. Second, if you write about such things, even in an informal commentary capacity, exercise a bit more skepticism before setting off a panic over suspicious incidents.

Obviously, the context here is the growing case that ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett might have been involved in staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago late last month. He continues to deny any involvement, aside from being attacked.

If this incident was fake, then he's gotten a lot of egg on a lot of other people's faces. He actually managed to get Democratic 2020 presidential candidates on record discussing him. He prompted a high-profile televised attack on Vice President Mike Pence, just for defending the traditional definition of marriage between a man and a woman. Whatever you think of Pence, this looks like an injustice -- of all the things that may have caused this attack, Mike Pence doesn't seem to figure at all.

Hate crimes are real, but so are hoaxes, and the latter occur more often than you'd think. Recently, our own Eddie Scarry catalogued three incidents that occurred just on college campuses in November -- campuses being a favorite location for hoax hate crimes. We've taken other previous looks at this lamentable phenomenon as well.

But as Quillette's Andy Ngo pointed out today on Twitter, there's an abundance of such hoaxes on and off campus, and they seem to have become considerably more frequent upon Trump's election. It's as if his presidency provides the excuse for people to pretend things are much worse than they are. The staged attacks and false-flag intimidation tactics range from seemingly minor campus incidents to street violence and racially intimidating vandalism. But all of these are harmful, for the reasons noted above.

When these things happen, the proper response is prudence and sober reporting of facts, rather than credulity and sensationalism. To wait and see is an improvement on starting a moral panic and convincing everyone that their communities are hopelessly rotten and their neighbors vicious and evil."

The rapper says that if the allegations are true, the Empire actor ruined Black History Month and gave Donald Trump the ability to openly mock black people without repercussions.

In an Instagram story, Cardi B laid out how disappointed she was with the situation if it is true, as she noshed on some lobster. She also suggested that the Chicago police could be attempting to frame the actor, so she was withholding judgment.

“I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro. Like, d**n. I’m not gonna say, yet. Until he say it out his mouth that it was fake and the shit was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because somebody I was talking to they said police in Chicago are racists,” she said. “So they might probably try to frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But if he’s not, then bro you f**ked up, for real. Like, why would you do that?”

She added that the situation would likely give President Trump and his supporters more fodder.

“You got Donald Trump immunity to f**king laugh,” she said.

Jussie Smollett says that he was attacked three weeks ago by men wearing Make America Great Again hats. He says the attackers placed a noose around his neck and poured a chemical that smelled like bleach on him in a racist, homophobic assault.

Gradually, details emerged that suggested that the attack may not have unfolded as the actor suggests. On Saturday, CNN published a story that quoted two law enforcement sources who say that Chicago Police have reason to believe that Smollett paid two extras from Empire to stage an attack on him. The two individuals were initially arrested on Wednesday but released after new information came to light in the investigation.

Smollett denies the allegations, and his lawyers say that he has cooperated with all of the police requests.

Cardi B isn’t the only celebrity to weigh in on the situation. Snoop Dogg posted an image of O.J. Simpson driving the infamous white SUV with Smollett’s head superimposed on the image. Reza Farahan says that the actor should be locked up if he faked the attack, according to TMZ. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said on Twitter that she needs more information before making a judgment because one can’t trust the police entirely and that she would stand with the actor until evidence proved otherwise."

As a result, Smollett allegedly paid two men $3,500 each to rehearse and then attack him a week later in an attempt to frame Trump supporters as violent racists.

(Article by Tyler Durder republished from ZeroHedge.com)

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information.

CBS 2 reporter Charlie De Mar spoke on the phone with the Osundario brothers Monday afternoon, who said in a joint statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett received a letter containing a “white substance” at Empire‘s Chicago Cinespace Studios where the show is filmed, prompting a HAZMAT response that failed to gain much traction. The “white substance” was later found to be aspirin.

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps. The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett. When asked about the letter in a televised interview last week, Smollett said, “On the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it.” It also had “MAGA” — reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan Make America Great Again – written as the return address. “In due course all the facts will reveal themselves and at the end of the day my clients are honest and credible” the brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said. –CBS 2 Chicago

Smollett appeared in a play with a similar “assault”

The Daily Mail reported on Monday that Smollett “landed in Chicago shortly after midnight” one day after he was in New York City for a reading of the play “Take Me Out,” which features a gay character who is attacked using “the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‘f****t’ and ‘n****r.'”

On Monday, Smollett’s new crisis management rep Anne Kavanaugh reported “There are no plans for Jussie to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett picked the wrong camera

After the alleged “attack” on January 29 in which Smollett alleged that two attackers recognized him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him (from the reading he had just flown back from), beat him up, poured a bleach-like liquid on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned him “This is MAGA country!” – Smollett made sure to tell Good Morning America last week that he spotted a surveillance camera that caught the entire incident.

Alas, as Breitbart‘s John Nolte notes, Smollett then admitted his disappointment that the camera was facing the wrong way.

And one can imagine, had there been surveillance footage of the attack, the investigation would have proceeded very, very differently. Once police had the footage, it would leak. Once cable and network news had the footage, it would loop endlessly. The fact that the two brothers are black wouldn’t matter. CBS Chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment. Smollett told police the attackers wore face masks. With those face masks, the organized left (the media, Democrats, celebrities) were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white. Breitbart

Just another hate crime hoax in America (allegedly, of course).

The latest fake news hoax perpetrated by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett proves, once again, that the “resistance” is willing to say or do pretty much anything to trash Trump supporters and stir the pot of anti-white racism. Even though many gays, blacks, and women support President Donald Trump, the fake news media continues to hammer the idea that Trump supporters are just pointy hat-wearing members of the Ku Klux Klan – and, sadly, many brainless Leftists believe such drivel, even after it’s been proven false again and again.

In the case of the Jussie Smollett hoax, CNN and many other fake news outlets ran with the ridiculous narrative that Smollett was attacked and “lynched” by white, MAGA hat-wearing racists in the streets of deep-blue Chicago, who shouted at him that “this is MAGA country.” With no evidence whatsoever to back his story, which contained many contradictory details, Smollett was quickly painted as a victim of “racism,” as the mainstream media declared him to be some kind of hero.

“Is it too much to ask CNN to bring an ounce of critical evidence to claims – especially on highly socially divisive topics such as a heinous hate crime – instead of closing their eyes and parroting whatever is the story line du jour merely because of politically convenient narratives?” commented Zero Hedge in an article about the hoax.

“How many embarrassing retractions, walk-backs, corrections, and deleted articles will it take?”

Conservative personality Mark Dice shares hilarious video montage of fake news outlets parroting Jussie Smollett hoax

As is now abundantly clear, Smollett was not randomly attacked by white, MAGA hat-wearing racists, but rather by two black Nigerians that he appears to have hired as part of the staged hoax. But the mainstream media is nowhere to be found in correcting the record – and is actually doubling down, in many cases, on this utterly ridiculous fake news story.

Conservative personality Mark Dice put together a hilarious video montage illustrating how the whole thing was scripted from the start. Be sure to watch the clip in its entirety, as it clearly illustrates how fake news outlets collude with one another to spew the same phrases and buzzwords in order to make their fake news talking points and headlines seem credible.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” tweeted Donald Trump Jr. about the fake news hoax.

“I wonder why CNN keeps forgetting the Trump Supporters part?” Trump Jr. joked in another tweet about how the fake news media’s narrative changed ever-so-slightly after it was revealed that the whole thing was a staged hoax.

Instead of retracting all of their fake news stories about Jussie Smollett, in other words, the fake news media simply tweaked them in a lame attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of gullible fake news consumers.

“They REALLY LOVED that part when the story first broke!!!” Trump Jr. added.

An 11-year-old Canada girl was found dead hours after her father picked her up to celebrate her birthday and Valentine's Day.

Roopesh Rajkumar, 41, was arrested and charged with the murder of his daughter, Riya Rajkumar, on Thursday when he failed to return her to her mother that evening. Within hours of issuing an AMBER Alert, authorities located the girl's body and took her father into custody.

""It's very heart-wrenching,"" Peel regional police Const. Danny Marttini said of the girl's death. ""We have to remember that this is a family, and she's now moving forward without her daughter.""

So who is Riya Rajkumar? Here is what we know.

1. She was celebrating Valentine's Day and her birthday.

Riya spent Thursday celebrating Valentine's Day and her birthday with her mother before she was picked up by her father, who was supposed to have her back home a few hours later. The parents met at a gas station around 3 p.m., where Riya went with Rajkumar to continue celebrating with her dad, whom she did not live with full-time.

2. Her father threatened to harm Riya and himself.

Riya's mother called police around 7 p.m. on Thursday after Rajkumar made threats to physically harm the victim and her mother, his former girlfriend, according to CTV News.

""She came in already fully concerned saying, 'This is what he's saying to me, I'm concerned for the well-being of my daughter, I need some help,""' Marttini said. ""Obviously our investigators took action right away.""

An investigation was launched in an effort to locate the 5th grader.

3. An AMBER Alert was issued.

Just after 11 p.m. Thursday an AMBER Alert was issued in hopes of finding Riya alive. Although the outcome was not what police hoped for, the alert directly led to her body and the arrest of her father, The Spec reported.

“As a result of the Amber Alert, they observed the vehicle and gave us the coordinates,” Dionne said. “Thankfully, we were able to apprehend this man.”

4. Her body was found around midnight.

Riya's body was found on the basement floor of her father's Brampton, Ont. duplex around midnight that night, about five hours after she was reported missing and in possible danger, CBC News reported. She was declared dead at the scene.

5. Her father was arrested and taken to the hospital.

Tips from people responding to the AMBER Alert led to Rajkumar's arrest, police said.

According to CTV News, Rajkumar was arrested by Ontario Provincial Police when authorities located him driving north on Highway 11 in Orillia, Ont., shortly after Riya's body was located. His arrest was considered a ""high-risk takedown"" and authorities took him to the hospital to be treated for a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“When we did take custody of the individual… our officers at that time did notice that there was a medical concern,” Marttini said. “They were concerned about his wellbeing. At that point, that individual was taken to the hospital.”

Rajkumar was charged with first-degree murder and will appear in court once he is medically cleared, police said.

6. Police received ""numerous"" complaints about the AMBER Alert.

Marttini said police were getting a number of complaints saying the AMBER Alert issued for Riya had inconveniently woken them up.

“You know, it’s unfortunate when an Amber Alert goes off in the sense that it disrupts people’s lifestyle,” said Martini, speaking to reporters on Friday. “But at the same point, we’re talking about a child that was missing and, in this case, the child was found deceased, and I think you have to weigh that out.”

Authorities took time to point out the importance of AMBER Alerts and their effectiveness, especially in this specific case that was reportedly ""inconvenient"" for some.

""Our communications bureau is receiving numerous calls to 9-1-1, complaining about the late hour of the Amber Alert. As a direct result of someone receiving the alert, we were able to locate the suspect & his vehicle. The system works. Thank you to all those that called with tips,"" Peel Regional Police tweeted just before midnight Thursday.

""We're talking about a child that was missing,"" Marttini said. ""I feel for everyone, but given the circumstances, I think it did lead to the arrest of the individual. I think that's what we have to focus on.""

I can’t even begin to describe how disappointing and upsetting it is to read the comments, emails and calls to our communications bureau complaining about receiving an Amber Alert late at night. I appreciate that a lot of people were sleeping but the immediate need to locate 1/2 — Cst. Akhil Mooken (@OfficerMooken) February 15, 2019

They spent that much time on what increasingly appears to have been a hoax, but the infamous torture of an autistic white man at the hands of black teens and broadcast live over Facebook, drew a little over 24 minutes. Both cases happened in Chicago.

As NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck documented early Sunday morning, between January 29 and February 14, the networks spent 101 minutes and 22 seconds helping to push Smollett’s claims of being assaulted by racist and homophobic Trump supporters. Since then and when the facts started to show that Smollett may have orchestrated and paid for the assault, the networks spent an additional 55 minutes and 23 seconds on it (between February 15 and 18).

All tallies in this study include ABC’s Good Morning America/World News Tonight, CBS’s This Morning/Evening News, NBC’s Today/Nightly News, and their weekend equivalents.

In sharp contrast, when a young white man was kidnapped for two days in the run-up to then President-elect Trump’s inauguration and tortured live on Facebook by black teens, the story was there and gone in just four days. As Houck also exposed on January 4, 2017, both ABC’s World News Tonight and NBC Nightly News skipped the story while CBS Evening News allocated a mere 27 seconds.

Between January 4 and 7, 2017, the networks spent 24 minutes and 38 seconds on the real hate crime. By January 7, they were so tired of the story that both ABC and CBS ran fleeting morning news briefs (21 and 19 seconds respectively). Meanwhile, NBC didn’t run any report at all on either newscast.

One of the criticisms of the liberal media’s coverage of Smollett’s allegations was just how ridiculous and unbelievable they were when real scrutiny was applied. Many believed the media pounced on Smollett’s claims because they desperately wanted to smear Trump supporters with the attack despite the lack of evidence.

Meanwhile, the 2017 torture incident was broadcast over Facebook Live by the attackers and thus included video evidence.

“Parts of the attack in Chicago were shown live on Facebook. And today the four suspects were charged with hate crimes. Dean Reynolds has the latest. And we do caution you, the video is quite disturbing,” warned fill-in anchor Josh Elliott during CBS Evening News on January 5, 2017.

The 2017 attack also appeared to be in response to then President-elect Trump’s upcoming inauguration. NBC’s Blake McCoy reporting on January 5’s Today: “A young, white man, that police say has special needs, bound, gagged and beaten by a group of African-Americans. One attacker, slashing his clothes and hair with a knife, while spouting anti-white, anti-Trump rhetoric.”

This wasn’t the only heinous crime out of Chicago to get minimal coverage by the networks. Back on April 22, 2014, CBS’s This Morning actually skipped the 52 people shot in the city over a three-day period.

And on May 31, 2016, then-MRC Culture Associate Editor Katie Yoder reported that the networks spent 54 times the airtime on the death of Harambe the gorilla than the 69 people killed over the Memorial Day weekend."

This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

Given recent reports that the incident was staged, a reporter asked Harris about her tweet.

In response, Harris appeared confused and asked “which tweet?” She then answered, “okay, so I will say this about that case. I think the facts are still unfolding and I’m very concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened.”

""And it’s something we should all take seriously whenever anyone, um, alleges that kind of behavior, but there should be an investigation,"" she added. ""And I think that once the investigation has concluded then we can all comment, but I’m not going to comment until I know the outcome of the investigation.""

Smollett, an actor in ""Empire"" who is black and gay, claimed that he was attacked while walking home in Chicago by two masked men who, he said, tied a noose around his neck and yelled racist, homophobic slurs and told him ""this is MAGA country.""

However, the Chicago Police Department said they had new information which ""shifted"" the investigation after the arrest and release of two suspects in connection with the alleged incident.

A source told CBS News that “two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the attack.”

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" the Chicago Police said in a statement Sunday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had deleted her tweet in support of Smollett by Monday which called the alleged attack ""an affront to our humanity.""

“As the Speaker who passed the fully inclusive Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, we spoke out because this appeared to be a deeply troubling incident of violence motivated against vulnerable communities,” Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, told Vanity Fair. “Given the turn in the investigation, we decided to no longer amplify the original accusation. Following the conclusion of the ongoing investigation, we will comment further. We should all be united in fighting racism and homophobia.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) made a comment to the press Sunday that was similar to what Harris said. However, he also took the opportunity to condemn “right-wing terrorist attacks.”

""I’m gonna withhold until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources,"" Booker said. ""We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way, and we actually even know in this country that since 9/11, the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks -- the majority of them white supremacist attacks.""

Booker had also initially called the attack an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

Since Empire actor Jussie Smollett first came forward with his hoax of being a victim of an alleged hate crime on January 29, the broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) have spent a whopping 157 minutes on the story during their flagship morning/evening new programs. They spent all that time on what was an increasingly apparent hoax, but the infamous torture of an autistic white man at the hands of black teen and broadcast live over Facebook, drew a little over 24 minutes. Both cases happened in Chicago.

As NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck documented early Sunday morning, between January 29 and February 14 the networks spent 101 minutes and 22 seconds helping to push Smollett’s claims of being assaulted by racist and homophobic Trump supporters. Then, when the facts started to show that Smollett may have orchestrated and paid for the assault, the networks spent an additional 55 minutes and 23 seconds on it (between February 15 and 18).

All tallies in this study include ABC’s Good Morning America/World News Tonight, CBS’s This Morning/Evening News, NBC’s Today/Nightly News, and their weekend equivalents.

In sharp contrast, when a young white man was kidnapped for two days in the run-up to then President-elect Trump’s inauguration and tortured live on Facebook by black teens, the story was there and gone in just four days. As Houck also exposed on January 4, 2017, both ABC’s World News Tonight and NBC Nightly News skipped the story while CBS Evening News allocated a mere 27 seconds.

“It’s a slap in the face. We have many members of the black community and the LGBTQ community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim…and we believe is a lie…certainly is an injustice to those true victims…,” Ali said. “Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying.” (ABC 7 Chicago)

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to co-operate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

WATCH:

“In 1987, Al Sharpton introduced the media to a young woman called Tawana Brawley. Brawley had an awful to story to tell. He said she had been viciously attacked by a group of racist white men and left in a garbage bag. She was covered in feces with racial slurs scrawled on her body,” Carlson began. “The Brawley case dominated headlines across the country for more than a year, and it bitterly divided New York City along ethnic lines. People hated each other because of what Tawana Brawley said happened to her.”

“But it was all a lie,” he continued. “After conducting hundreds of interviews, a grand jury declared the entire story fraudulent, none of it actually happened. Brawley fled the state, a judge ordered Al Sharpton to pay for damages for accusing innocent men of rape. That should’ve been the end of Al Sharpton’s career, yet just the opposite happened.” (RELATED: Here Are All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgement On The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

“After he perpetuated the single most destructive racial hoax in memory, Al Sharpton got a promotion. He became a world-famous civil rights leader. He ran for president. He became a policy adviser to Barack Obama,” Carlson added. “According to visitor logs, Al Sharpton was invited to the Obama White House more than 80 times. He got his own show on MSNBC, which he still has. Sharpton has never apologized or even acknowledge the harm he did to this country by lying about Tawana Brawley.”

Sharpton was one of the first to come out in support for the “Empire” actor, following the alleged attack last month, in which Smollett alleged two white men attacked him. He told police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him, tied a rope around his neck similar to a noose and shouted racist, homophobic slurs.

Sharpton demanded the attackers be held accountable and face the maximum penalty.

Now that Chicago PD appears to believe the attack was staged, Sharpton is calling for Smollett to be punished if this theory proves true.

WATCH:



“Shall we call it on Smollett?” Gutfeld asked. “The police no longer consider Jussie Smollett a victim. Queue faces covered in egg.”

The network then played a media montage on Smollett’s original claims from major networks like CNN and MSNBC, which later even included actress Ellen Page blaming the attack on Vice President Mike Pence.

“Meanwhile, we kept quiet,” said Gutfeld. “Sure the idea of Trumpers wandering in subzero Chicago at 2:00 a.m. carrying bleach and a noose, attacking some actor from a show they don’t even watch without taking his phone, wallet or sandwich seemed about as real as me joining “The View,” but Smollett was the perfect victim for a media that deems any skepticism heresy.” (RELATED: Donald Trump Jr., Others Slam Jussie Smollett, Media Coverage Surrounding Alleged Trump Supporter Perpetrated Hate Crime)

The Fox News host argued that the “press orgy that attracts” the hoaxes keep them from being rare.

“Now the media circles its wagons,” he said, naming several major media outlets that fell for the hoax, despite CNN’s claim that “only the celebrity press fell for this.”

“CNN says Smollett’s actions set back the movement,” Gutfeld said. “No, it didn’t. Maybe it set back the hoax crime movement and that’s good. Perhaps the media might think first so it will have fewer hoaxes, but don’t count on it. The media says no one should be pleased by the events that fake hoaxes hurt real victims but they never mention the groups who are falsely accused. Seriously, this could have led to real violence against them.”

Gutfeld expressed his satisfaction that what people at first thought was a hate crime “fell apart,” because it “once again proves we are less racist than the media wants us to be.”

But the rapper isn’t giving up on the actor, yet.

UPDATE (3/26/19), 11:35 AM EST: The charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett — over allegedly staging a racial attack against himself in Chicago on January 29 — have all been dropped, his Chicago-based attorney Ronald Safer confirms to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued the following statement (on March 26, 2019 at 1:15 PM EST) in wake of this development: “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”

ORIGINAL: Cardi B, 26, is sharing her thoughts on the Jussie Smollett case, nearly three weeks after the Empire star claimed that he was the victim of a brutal racist and homophobic attack. As multiple outlets, including NBC News and CNN, are reporting that unnamed “law enforcement sources” claim that Chicago officers believe the actor may have staged the attack, the rapper is telling fans that she’s “disappointed” in him. In an Instagram Live video that she filmed on Feb. 17, Cardi says, “So I’m really disappointed in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f*** his name is. I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f***ed up Black History Month, bro. Like, damn.”

But the “Money” rapper reveals in the video that she hasn’t completely given up hope on Jussie, 36. She adds, “I’m not gonna say yet – until he says out his mouth that it was fake and the s*** was staged, I don’t want to completely blame him, because like somebody that I was talking to, they said police in Chicago are racist so they might probably [be] trying [to] frame him and make him look like he’s a liar. But, if he’s not then bro, you f***ed up for real. Why did you do that? You don’t have to do that. Then you give f***ing Donald Trump immunity to laugh at n****s and s***, and make motherf***ers look bad. S*** brazy [sic] bro.”

Cardi B goes on to explain one of the reasons why she is not totally slamming Jussie. She alleges that New York police once lied about her to the press after she publicly accused officers of putting her in a “headlock.” HollywoodLife has reached out to the NYPD about Cardi’s serious allegations but we have yet to receive a response. But they addressed the claims in 2017 telling Teen Vogue, in part, “There is no indication that this ever occurred. We do not believe it has any merit.”

Even though Cardi is willing to reserve judgement on Jussie she did note reports that the two brothers who were arrested – and then released without charge – in connection with the case are cooperating with police. “But they do say they have evidence from both the brothers that they spoke though,” she says in the video. “I don’t know. I want to see what else. I want to know… You have so many people standing for you. Why would you do that bro?”

Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Chicago PD have denied reports that they believe Jussie’s case was a hoax. On Feb. 14, the department’s Chief Communications Officer, Anthony Guglielmi, tweeted, “Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives. Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Through his lawyers Jussie has also denied that the attack was a hoax. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” his legal team said in a Feb. 16 statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.”"

While allegations that Smollett staged his own attack remain to be proven, Cardi B is admitting she’s shook up by what’s been taking place.

In an Instagram Live video the “Bodak Yellow” rapper recorded on Monday, she said that if that does prove to be the case it will be a sad situation.

“So, I’m really disappointed… in Jussie Smollett, whatever the f**k his name is,” she said. “I’m really disappointed in him. I feel like he f**ked up Black History Month, bro.”

However, she also insisted on giving Smollett the benefit of the doubt. “I’m not gonna say… yet, until he said out his mouth that it was fake and this s**t was staged,” she added. “I don’t wanna completely blame him, because, you know, like, somebody that I was talking to, they said, like, you know, ‘police in Chicago are racist.’ So they might probably tryna frame him and make him look like he’s a liar.”

Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until it’s completed.

Speaking Monday to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, during her first presidential campaign trip to the state, the U.S. senator from California says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” Police in Chicago say their investigation into the report that the actor was attacked by two men yelling slurs has “shifted” after two brothers were questioned and released. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The long Presidents Day holiday brought Harris and other Democratic presidential candidates to New Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020. Also campaigning in the Granite State were Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, campaigned in Iowa as well.

Highlights from the trail:

KAMALA HARRIS

Harris let voters in New Hampshire know that she does not consider herself a democratic socialist – a not-so-veiled distinction setting her apart from New Hampshire voters’ favorite 2016 primary candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Sanders, a potential rival for the party’s 2020 nomination, has described himself as a democratic socialist, and the Vermont independent didn’t abandon the politically fraught label for his previous campaign.

Harris was asked by a reporter whether she would have to tilt her politics leftward – in the direction of democratic socialism – to win the state’s primary. Sanders handily defeated Hillary Clinton when they competed for the state’s delegates three years ago.

“The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist,” Harris said in response to the question, posed as she toured Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord ahead of a Portsmouth town hall.

ELIZABETH WARREN

Warren is planning to unveil a universal child care plan that would guarantee American families access to child care.

The U.S. senator from Massachusetts would use part of the revenue from her proposed tax on the ultra-wealthy to fund her child care plan. A person familiar with the plan outlined it ahead of its release Tuesday on condition of anonymity.

Warren’s plan would set up a federal program to guarantee child care from birth until children’s entry into school. Families with income less than 200 percent of the poverty line would get free access. Other families would pay no more than 7 percent of their income.

Her plan would guarantee compensation for child care program workers at rates comparable to public school teachers in their areas.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stopped short of agreeing with fellow New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s comments celebrating Amazon’s plans to cancel building a second headquarters in the state.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., hailed the cancellation as a day “dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed.”

Campaigning for president in Cedar Rapids Iowa, Gillibrand said she thinks Ocasio-Cortez’s point is that subsidies given to Amazon were outrageous, not that she didn’t want the jobs in New York.

Amazon faced opposition from some New York officials who were unhappy with the tax incentives the retailer was promised.

Gillibrand told reporters that taxpayers were going to be “left holding the bag” and that shows the deal was outrageous.

Smollett has accused two assailants of hitting him over the head while wearing ski masks and yelling homophobic and racial slurs, along with placing a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him. Despite the Chicago PD stating that they have “no reason to doubt” the statements made by Smollett and his manager, a vocal contingent remains skeptical that the assault happened. Presumably, these folks take issue with Smollett not handing over his phone records and the unfortunate fact that the attackers haven’t been found, although police are still seeking these two men for questioning.

The actor and singer, who previously insisted that he’s remained “100% factual and consistent” while speaking to law enforcement, told Roberts that he’s not only angry about being physically attacked but at how some have assailed him with doubts. He also believes that if his attackers weren’t white, then perhaps those doubters would be behaving differently:

“I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.” “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett, who has been supported by countless public figures in solidarity, including Umbrella Academy star Ellen Page (who blamed VP Mike Pence for his policies and views that she thinks contributed to the normalization of homophobia), also takes umbrage in the below clip at those who keep calling this an “alleged attack.” He stresses that he fought back, and his attackers fled, and he hopes that he can inspire young gay men to not only learn to defend themselves if necessary but “learn to fight for what you believe in.”

He then shed tears while describing how a friend told him that his attackers probably wouldn’t be found by law enforcement. He admitted to feeling “angry” about that inevitability while wondering, “So, I’m just gonna be left here with this?” Despite everything that’s gone down, however, Smollett hopes for a different outcome. “I want to believe,” he declared. “With everything that has happened, that there is something called justice.”

Empire actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack in Chicago in January drew outrage across the entertainment world and beyond. But the attack which was first investigated as a hate crime may have a new angle.

ABC 7 Chicago reporter Rob Elgas tweeted on Thursday that a source said the attack may have been a setup in order to get Smollett attention after his Empire role was being written off.

BREAKING: Multiple soucres tell @ABC7Chicago Eyewitness News Jussie Smollet and the 2 men who are being questioned by police staged the attack – allegedly because his character was being written out of the show Empire. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019

Smollett claims he was brutally attacked, with racial and homophobic slurs directed toward him by unknown assailants. But according to Elgas, those attackers may have been plotting with Smollett himself to stage the incident.

All of this coming hours after Smollett spoke to @GMA speaking out in his first media interview taking aim at those who doubted his story. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) February 15, 2019



As The Hollywood Reporter noted on Thursday, this report came after police apparently singled out persons of interest in the attack.

This news also comes after a report by CBS Chicago said the police raided the home of two persons of interest in the attack on Wednesday night. The local news outlet reports that both men are of Nigerian descent and have appeared as extras on the show. CBS Chicago reporter Charles De Mar tweeted on Thursday that he “asked family why they think police picked the two brothers up for questioning and they replied by saying the men left for #Nigeria the day of the attack.” The report also claims that police took bleach, shoes, electronics and other items from the home and that Smollett was questioned on Thursday as well.

This comes after Smollett rebuffed skepticism about the attack following his appearance on Good Morning America, his first public appearance after the alleged attack. Smollett said he was “pissed off” that people doubted his story, but on Thursday that list apparently included the police."

Smollett alleged that two white men attacked him in the middle of the night as he was walking home from a Chicago-area “Subway” restaurant last month. He told police that the men poured a bleach-like substance on him and tied a noose-like rope around his neck while shouting racist and homophobic slurs.

There have been reports suggesting that the attack was actually staged by Smollett and the two brothers were paid for their participation, according to CNN.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement Sunday, saying such claims were “nothing further from the truth.”

It also appears that the case could be headed to a grand jury.

Smollett claims he was verbally and physically assaulted on January 29 by two white men yelling about so-called “MAGA country” in downtown Chicago for being gay and black. However, recent reports reveal the actor likely hired two Nigerian men to stage the highly-publicized attack on him.

“Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the ‘Empire’ actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return,” CBS News Chicago reports.

Apparently, Mr. Smollett was not pleased when a racist, MAGA-inspired threatening letter allegedly sent to him did not generate enough media attention. Thus, the plot to carry out the attack was born, new reports suggest.

Reacting to the case’s developments, civil rights leaders have been distancing themselves from Smollett, and on Sunday, one such activist, Los Angeles’ Najee Ali, slammed the actor for nearly sparking a “race war” and demanded Smollett be “arrested and prosecuted” for the apparent “hoax.”

Ali, director of Project Islamic HOPE, said what Smollett reportedly did was a “slap in the face” to real victims.

“Today, Project Islamic HOPE is calling upon the arrest and criminal prosecution of ‘Empire’ star and actor Jussie Smollett. We believe Mr. Smollett lied about being the victim of a hate crime and being assaulted, and for us, it’s a slap in the face.”

“Mr. Smollett put people’s lives at risk and could have created a situation that was much more damaging for those who are African American and for those who do identify with the LGBT community. We have many members of the black community and the LGBT community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crime — and we believe that is a lie — certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes.”

“Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying,” Ali said, adding, “We gave him the benefit of the doubt” until Smollett’s “campaign of lies” unraveled his story.

Ali continued: “Also, Smollett could have created a race war! There were many African American and many members of the LGBT community who were very upset and outraged by Smollett claiming he was attacked and victimized. So there were some in those communities whose thoughts are a little more extreme, they wanted to retaliate.”

“If Jussie Smollett really wants to do what’s right, he’ll stop lying,” said the activist, noting that the actor needs to offer an apology.

Smollett’s case took a dramatic turn on Saturday when police revealed that the two brothers detained for questioning on Wednesday, who are Americans of Nigerian descent, were released Friday without charges because they were no longer “potential suspects” but, instead, were “fully cooperating” with authorities. That cooperation has included the two men telling police that Smollett allegedly paid them a total of $4,000 to stage the January 29 attack in a predetermined location. Smollett told the police and the press that he was the victim of a “racist” and “homophobic” attack by two Trump supporters who yelled, “n***er,” “f***ot,” and “This is MAGA country!” while beating him, pouring bleach on him, and putting a noose around his neck.

Smollett has since lawyered up and, since the bombshell reports Saturday, has thus far refused to go in for further questioning by the Chicago Police Department. On Monday, multiple outlets reported that sources close to the investigation say they were told Smollett may have orchestrated the attack because he was upset that a threatening letter allegedly sent to him did not get a “bigger reaction” from the media — a claim which, like many of the claims made so far about the case, police have not confirmed.

But while there are still a lot of questions to be answered and claims to be either confirmed or denied, backlash to the bizarre case has been gaining momentum. While the mainstream media that largely reported Smollett’s initial story unquestioningly has been playing damage control, social media users have taken to platforms like Twitter to weigh in on the potential “#HateHoax.” In a thread that has stirred up a lot of attention, one independent journalist has used the platform to publish an incomplete but still lengthy list of recent hate crime hoaxes that has gained traction online.

Below are a few examples from hundreds of responses online to what many now suspect to be another hoax. First up, a few tweets from two high-profile figures who couldn’t be further apart on the ideological spectrum: Donald Trump Jr., who has some fun calling out the left-leaning media and celebrities, and Alyssa Milano, a left-leaning celebrity who’s so disappointed by the news that she can’t bring herself to utter the name of “that man.”

“Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a righ guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless. Seemed so real,” Trump Jr. wrote Sunday in one of a series of posts.

“If that man staged his own attack he is wrong in so many ways,” wrote a disappointed Milano Monday. “No one could be that hurtful? To stage this? Right? To f*** with all of us by playing into our weaknesses & make it even harder for victims to come forward?! No one could choose to be that hurtful? Right?! RIGHT?”

A thread that is starting to gain attention in conservative media circles is independent journalist Andy Ngo’s ever-growing “Hate Hoax” list. A few examples from the thread, which he started over the weekend:

Pamela Taylor, 57, admitted to falsely registering for FEMA disaster benefits after a catastrophic flood in June 2016 killed more than 20 people and damaged numerous properties in West Virginia.



Taylor’s home wasn’t damaged and she was living in it during the natural disaster but she claimed it was and that she was forced to live in a rental property.

“The flood was a natural disaster. Stealing from FEMA is a manmade disaster,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart in a statement. “The floods of June 2016 were historic and devastating to thousands of West Virginians. Lives were lost. Too many of our brothers and sisters lost everything. FEMA dollars are critical but limited. Stealing critical FEMA dollars is a crime – literally and figuratively.”

Stuart noted that “Taylor’s fraud scheme diverted disaster benefits from our most desperate and vulnerable, those most in need of help. We take the solemn responsibility of ensuring FEMA dollars are used responsibly and legally. The public can rest assured that my office takes heinous acts like stealing from disaster relief funds very seriously and will prosecute each and every case brought to us to the maximum extent of the law.”

Taylor faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 when she’s sentenced on May 30.

Kamala Harris says she won’t comment again on the investigation into a reported attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett until it’s completed.

Speaking Monday to reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, during her first presidential campaign trip to the state, the U.S. senator from California says that “the facts are still unfolding” and that while she is “very concerned” about Smollett’s initial allegation and it should be taken seriously, “there should be an investigation.”

Harris previously tweeted that the alleged attack was “an attempted modern day lynching.” Police in Chicago say their investigation into the report that the actor was attacked by two men yelling slurs has “shifted” after two brothers were questioned and released. Smollett’s lawyers say the actor feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

The long Presidents Day holiday brought Harris and other Democratic presidential candidates to New Hampshire, the state with the first-in-the-nation primary in 2020. Also campaigning in the Granite State were Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York was back in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who also is running for president, campaigned in Iowa as well.

Highlights from the trail:

KAMALA HARRIS

Harris let voters in New Hampshire know that she does not consider herself a democratic socialist – a not-so-veiled distinction setting her apart from New Hampshire voters’ favorite 2016 primary candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Sanders, a potential rival for the party’s 2020 nomination, has described himself as a democratic socialist, and the Vermont independent didn’t abandon the politically fraught label for his previous campaign.

Harris was asked by a reporter whether she would have to tilt her politics leftward – in the direction of democratic socialism – to win the state’s primary. Sanders handily defeated Hillary Clinton when they competed for the state’s delegates three years ago.

“The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist,” Harris said in response to the question, posed as she toured Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord ahead of a Portsmouth town hall.

ELIZABETH WARREN

Warren is planning to unveil a universal child care plan that would guarantee American families access to child care.

The U.S. senator from Massachusetts would use part of the revenue from her proposed tax on the ultra-wealthy to fund her child care plan. A person familiar with the plan outlined it ahead of its release Tuesday on condition of anonymity.

Warren’s plan would set up a federal program to guarantee child care from birth until children’s entry into school. Families with income less than 200 percent of the poverty line would get free access. Other families would pay no more than 7 percent of their income.

Her plan would guarantee compensation for child care program workers at rates comparable to public school teachers in their areas.

The January 29 attack was described by the actor as a racial and homophobic crime, during which he was bitten and had bleach poured on him, with his attackers screaming “MAGA country” throughout.

But as more and more details have emerged about the incident, the two suspects, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were released as new evidence came to light to suggest that Smollett himself had actually orchestrated the attack. The Empire actor has strongly denied these claims.

Now ABC News is reporting that a source has offered a potential reason for Smollett to have planned his own attack. According to the network, Smollett received a threatening letter to the Chicago Fox studio where Empire is filmed just a week before the attack took place. The letter, which contained “threatening language and was laced with a powdery substance investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol,” was largely ignored.

The Osundairo brothers reportedly told police during their questioning that Smollett had been upset by the lack of attention the letter had received. It was this lack of attention that they said led Smollett to decide to stage the attack.

So far police have not yet corroborated the Osundairo brothers’ account of the events, but the fact that they are no longer in jail or currently facing charges could indicate that police believe there is some merit to their side of the story.

The Osundairo brothers were arrested after police found evidence that they had purchased the rope that was used in the attack. Since their release, no one else has been arrested or charged in connection with the case, but if it’s found that Smollett was the instigator he could be facing charges for his own attack.

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” the Osundairo brothers said in a statement.

To deal with the disaster he has on his hands, Smollett has hired crisis manager Anne Kavanaugh to his legal team. He has also released a number of statements to try and refute the claims. While police wanted to speak to Smollett on Monday, he has not yet met with them, instead preferring to allow his legal counsel to deal with the situation on his behalf."

Writer Andy Ngo compiled a list of similar incidents since the election.

Days before Election Day, an African-American church in Mississippi was torched in an arson attack. The words ""Vote Trump"" were written on the building. A local police investigation determined a member of the church had staged the attack.

A Malden, Mass., man said in November 2016 two white men threatened to lynch him and told him it was ""Trump country now."" The story was debunked by police.

Days after that election, an Asian female student at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis said she was verbally harassed by a white man who told her to go back to Asia. She said she fought him off, then was put in handcuffs by police officers who came to the scene. Police said they had no record of responding to such an incident.

That same month, a Muslim student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette claimed two white Trump supporters violently assaulted her, took her hijab off her head, and robbed her. The story was later deemed untrue.

[Related: Video of Ellen Page blaming Pence for attack on Jussie Smollett rises above 18M views]

In 2017, a female student at St. Olaf College in Minnesota reported finding a note on her car windshield that contained a threatening message. Police said later that she made up the story.

After an immigrant-owned business in Charlotte in April 2017, investigators found a note that stated ""Trump is our nation builder for White America."" Police later arrested a black man named Curtis Flournoy.

That same year, a black male student at Kansas State University student said his car was vandalized with racist messages. The school canceled classes, and protests erupted on campus. The alleged victim, Dauntarius Williams, later admitted he vandalized his own car and staged the incident. He wasn't charged with making a false report.

Last September, a black woman from Long Island, N.Y., said a Trump supporter verbally confronted her and she later found her car tire had been slashed and a note on the car that read ""go home."" She later admitted to making up the story.

Following the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre in late October, someone vandalized a Brooklyn synagogue with Nazi slogans. The suspect was later identified as a gay black man who had worked with the city council on an anti-hate campaign.

In November, Goucher College found graffiti on campus of that contained Ku Klux Klan and Nazi marks, as well as the names of black students. A black student was eventually found to be responsible."

On Monday (February 18), TMZ reported that suspects Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were released without charges over the weekend, told cops that the attack was not only faked, it was also rehearsed. They explained that they got in a car with the actor/singer and scouted locations, settling on the scene of the assault because Smollett thought a surveillance camera would capture the action. However, the recording device was pointed in the wrong direction and didn't catch anything.

Chicago's CBS 2 also revealed new information regarding the case, with multiple sources claiming the 36-year-old got upset when a disturbing letter that was sent to the show's studio on January 22 didn't get a ""bigger reaction.""

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told the news channel, with others corroborating.

The letter was addressed to Smollett and crafted with letters cut from magazines to create racial and homophobic threats toward the actor, as well as a stick figure drawing of a man hanging from a tree with a gun shooting at him. The envelope contained a white substance, which was later identified as crushed aspirin. The return address was simply ""MAGA,"" which refers to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. When detectives searched the Osundairo brothers' house, they found a “piece of paper/writing,” a magazine, and a ""wallet with stamps.""

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,"" the brothers said in a statement. ""We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett and claim he paid them $3500 to carry out the attack.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement from Smollett's lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued. ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity."""

Investigators purportedly know why Empire’s Jussie Smollett faked an attack involving a noose and a mysterious chemical.

Chicago’s CBS 2 reports that a racist letter addressed to Jussie was recently sent to the television program’s Illinois studio. According to the station’s source, when it didn’t make a louder noise in the press, the actor decided to create his own story:

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information. The blockbuster revelation into at least part of Smollett’s potential motive comes two days after CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar reported Smollett and two brothers — Ola and Abel Osundairo — staged the attack on Jan. 29 in Streeterville. De Mar spoke on the phone exclusively with the Osundairo brothers Monday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

As per the CBS piece, on January 22nd, Jussie received mail featuring a drawn, hanged stick figure with a gun to his head, “MAGA” in capital letters, and ransom-note-style cut-out magazine letters spelling “You will die, black fag.”

The powder was later determined to be aspirin.

But could Jussie have also participated in the letter sent to the show’s Chicago Cinespace Studios?

More from CBS 2:

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s (who, along with his sibling, is an acquaintance of Jussie’s) home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps. … During the search of the brothers’ home last week, a “piece of paper/writing” was also seized. CBS 2 is the only news source with video from inside that house. Police evidence logs exclusively obtained by CBS 2, show investigators took the writing sample, magazine, and a “wallet with stamps.” Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500.

What do you make of this latest turn? If Jussie faked an attack, he was surely capable of a mail hoax. Furthermore, if the brother sent the letter and the siblings are friends of Jussie’s, that certainly seems to suggest this was a — for lack of a better term — package deal.

The first is that Smollett is a horrible person who would quite literally worsen racial hostilities in order to keep his position on a show. This is made even more apparent by the fact that Smollett was willing to press charges on two innocent people in order to make his case real.

The second is that the press is just as disgusting, if not more so.

While Smollett was willing to use a leftist anti-Trump/anti-white narrative in order to keep his part on a show, the media was only too ready to take Smollett’s story and run with it as fast as possible without waiting for any of the facts to catch up.

Everyone from CNN’s Don Lemon to The Atlantic’s Jemele Hill immediately began their wailing and gnashing of teeth. Rolling Stone, MSNBC, and PBS reporters all confirmed that the horrors that Trump was bringing onto the nation were as real as they’ve been telling us all along.

Before they even thought to question the validity of the story, the media began pouncing — two can play at that game — on Smollett’s claims like they were 100 percent factual. They finally had a case for their narrative. Proof that what they’ve been saying all along about Trump and his supporters is true. The reality that they wanted to live in was finally proven to be a reality.

And herein lies a very sick truth.

The leftist media hoped that a black, gay man had come to harm. They were thrilled to learn, or so they thought, that there really are roving gangs of racist, homophobic Trump supporters seeking out minorities and hurting them in various ways.

They were far too excited about the prospect that America is the bigoted country they’ve been screaming from soapboxes, claiming that it is.

How horrible is it that our media actually wishes that evil existed? That people were out there getting hurt? They’re so ready and willing to believe that this is happening in America that, not only will they not wait for the facts, they’ll point fingers and foment mistrust and hatred without knowing the story.

Why would they want this?

It all boils down to how the left obtains power.

Human beings are basically good creatures. Whenever they hear about someone suffering an injustice, or getting down on their luck, many do various things in order to help fix the problem. If someone suffered a crime, then generally the people will move to make sure that no one else suffers that crime again.

Tell the people that these victims are consistently created due to a problem and the people will do their best to make sure that the problem is solved.

If the problem is racism, and that racism is coming from their political opponents, then they’re banking on the fact that people will vote out any of those politicians in order to put in the kind, caring, and totally not racist politicians they approve of.

In short, the leftist media is attempting to manipulate people’s good nature in order to make them either subservient or offensive, depending on what group you belong to. The problems are only compounded when true believers of the cause are willing to lie and harm others in order to make sure their narrative thrives.

The media often times knows it’s withholding information, and telling half-truths, if not flat-out lying. This lie is divisive and creates the very problems they claim they’re trying to solve. The real truth is that America, while it has its racist characters, is not a racist country. It’s not homophobic, though a small number of homophobic people do exist.

It’s disgusting that our media would hope that we do live in a country as horrible as they claim, and God help us if we ever do live in a world the leftist media fantasizes about."

In a Facebook post on Sunday, the grieving widow called the day she learned about the workplace killings “a literal nightmare.”

Her husband Josh was among the victims who were fatally shot Friday at water valve manufacturer Henry Pratt Co. when an employee opened fire. Six law officials were also wounded.

“It took me several times reading it for it to hit me that it was for real,” Pinkard wrote of the text from her husband.

“I called his plant and a lady answered and said she was barricaded in her room and police were everywhere. Of course, my heart dropped.”

On having to deliver the news to her family, Pinkard said, “I told my children their dad did not make it and is in heaven with Jesus. I’ve never had to do something that hard.”

She described her husband as “brilliant” and her “best friend” and “the man I would have leaned on during devastation like this who would tell me it’s ok Terra, it is all going to be fine.”

“The man who was dying and found the clarity of mind for just a second to send me one last text to let me know he would always love me,” she added.

The gunman, 45-year-old Gary Montez Martin — who died during a shootout with cops — arrived at the warehouse on Friday for a meeting with human resources and was informed his position at the company had been terminated. The Huff Post reports that Martin snapped at the news and then opened fire with a .40 Smith & Wesson handgun that had an attached laser.

“My heart goes out to the victims and their families who simply went to work today like any other day,” Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said in a news conference Friday night.

“Mueller Water Products is shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific tragedy that occurred today at our Henry Pratt facility,” Mueller Water Products, which owns Henry Pratt, said in a statement on the company’s website.

“Our entire focus is on the health and wellbeing of our colleagues, and we are committed to providing any and all support to them and their families,” the statement continued."

Harris has also used the Smollett attack to push legislation that would make lynching a federal hate crime.

On Sunday, Harris’ fellow senator and Democratic presidential candidate, Cory Booker, told reporters he would “withhold” judgment on the matter “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Booker also referred to the alleged January 29 attack on Smollett as “an attempted modern-day lynching” and called on Congress to make lynching a federal hate crime.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed he was assaulted by two men who yelled racist and anti-gay slurs — as well as the phrase “This is MAGA country!” — as Smollett was walking to his Chicago apartment.

Chicago police arrested and questioned two Nigerian brothers in the alleged attack, but released them on Friday without charges.

Investigators said they’ve requested a follow-up interview with Smollett, but the actor’s representatives said there have been no plans to meet with police for the time being.

The Chicago Police Department has repeatedly declined to confirm local media reports that the attack was staged.

California Sen. Kamala Harris called it “an attempted modern-day lynching.” So did New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. (He used those exact same words.) “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color,” tweeted New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

On and on it went. Why? Because it seemed so ready-made for politicians hoping to make a point about the poisoning of our culture by Trump and his ilk: Smollett is gay, black and an outspoken critic of Trump. Of course Trump supporters reacted violently!

Except, not. Chicago police had confirmed they were investigating a possible hate crime against Smollett when he reported it, but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case have told CNN the police now believe Smollett paid two men — brothers — to stage the attack on him. Smollett has denied that charge but has yet to speak again directly with the police about the circumstances surrounding the incident on January 29.

That news has led to a massive conservative counterattack — on Democrats and the media who they argue were all too willing to cast Smollett as the victim of an attack, even though corroborating evidence was in short supply.

“Hey Hollywood and media types, I’ve noticed a lot of you deleted your #JusticeForJussie tweets… what’s the matter, don’t you want justice for him anymore??? #frauds,” tweeted Donald Trump Jr., the President’s eldest son — and proud Twitter troll.

And ’round and ’round we go. Whatever the ultimate details are about what happened with or to Smollett on that January night, his claims are a useful lens to see our current politics — and what is deeply broken about them.

We live in a political world — and in a broader society, because, let’s be honest, everything is political now — that puts a premium on instant reactions. As soon as something happens, politicians scramble to beat each other off the draw to comment. Reporters ask them for their statements, and analysts — yours truly often included — start writing about what happened, what politicians said about what happened and what it all means.

So, the media has a role in this. It’s not all politicians’ fault.

However, because politics has become so, so base-centric in the last decade-ish, politicians are forever on the hunt for stories that confirm what their base already believes. If they can be the first and/or loudest voice in condemnation, they believe that helps them — especially when they are running for president.

And so, Democratic 2020 candidates were very quick to believe Smollett’s version of events. And now Republicans — especially those aligned with the Trump White House — are just as quick to seize on the idea this was all an elaborate hoax. Both sides are simply exhibiting confirmation bias. Because we reward that sort of thing in our politics now.

Which is why more than a decade after the Duke lacrosse case and in the shadow of the Covington Catholic story, we are where we are on Jussie Smollett."

“We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,” brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo said in a statement released by lawyer Gloria Schmidt.

The two men were arrested Wednesday as the suspects who allegedly attacked the gay, black man in January. They were released from the custody of Chicago police Friday after police said ""new evidence"" indicated they were not suspected of any wrongdoing.

Smollett had said at the time of the attack that two white men attacked him. Video footage showed the two assailants were not white and reports broke that the men were Nigerian citizens. Police said Saturday that the men were U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent. The two reportedly flew to Nigeria after the attack on Jan. 29.

Chicago police are now investigating whether Smollett orchestrated the incident and paid the two men to pretend to hurt him so that he would gain national attention at a time when he was being written off Fox's prime-time show ""Empire.""

Smollett had planned to blame President Trump for inciting the violence he experienced, according to several outlets.

Actor Jussie Smollett reportedly received a threatening letter a week before he was the alleged victim of a possible hate crime that has come under scrutiny as multiple reports have indicated that attack may have been orchestrated.

According to CBS News, multiple sources said that Smollett was sent a hateful, threatening, and racist letter to the studio where “Empire” is filmed, and was dissatisfied by the response.

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” an unidentified source told the news outlet. The claim was reportedly corroborated by additional sources.

Smollett reportedly received the letter, photographed in the CBS News story, on January 22, a week before he was allegedly assaulted by two people who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him and tied a rope around his neck. According to the report, the letter included racial and homophobic slurs and a death threat, in letters appearing to be cut and pasted from a magazine or magazines.

CBS News also reports that investigators retrieved a magazine from the home of two brothers who were arrested and released last week in connection to the alleged attack, and who are reportedly cooperating with police. As CrimeOnline reported, a lawyer for the actor denied that Smollett was previously acquainted with the alleged assailants, following numerous reports that claimed Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to help orchestrate the attack, promising an additional $500 after they returned to the United States from a trip to Nigeria. The brothers were reportedly apprehended at the airport upon their return to Chicago last week.

“In due course all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible,” Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers, told CBS News.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, sources have said that Smollett is believed to have paid for the rope that was used in the alleged assault, though authorities have not publicly commented on Smollett’s possible role in what was initially perceived as a hate crime.

The Chicago Police Department gave a statement to CBS News on Monday, which reads in part:

“When this investigation is over, we will have a detailed accounting of the case. While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include additional investigation and speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

Smollett’s laywers said on Monday that he had not yet scheduled a meeting with police for follow-up questioning.

According to the Daily Mail, Smollett, 35, participated in two readings of Tony-winning play “Take Me Out” in New York City on January 28, a day before the reported attack in Chicago. In the play, the lead, a biracial baseball player, is attacked by a new pitcher—who calls him a “f****t” and “n****r”—after coming out as gay. The tabloid noted that the men play on a team called the New York Empires.

Afterward, Smollett reportedly traveled to La Guardia Airport to fly to Chicago, where he was to film the final episodes of Empire’s fourth season. A source told the Daily Mail that Smollett used his Instagram stories to alert brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo of a delay while en route.

One of the Instagram posts reportedly read, “Guess who is still on this motherf**king runway after two hours?”

“Hey it’s me again…think i took off yet? Naaaaah…,” the actor purportedly wrote in a post two hours later. It is unclear why the source believes that Smollett posted Instagram stories about his flight delay as a way of alerting the brothers.

Smollett reportedly updated his Instagram story when he finally took off and when he arrived in Chicago around midnight. He’s believed to have walked to a local Subway at 2 a.m. and reported that two men attacked as he exited the restaurant.

The play draws a noteworthy comparison to what Smollett reportedly claimed the masked assailants said to him during the January 29 assault. According to reports, the black, openly gay actor told police that the suspects asked him, “Aren’t you that f**** ‘Empire’ n****r?” moments before the assault. He allegedly said the suspects then tied a noose around his neck and dumped a liquid on him before fleeing the scene.

The Osundairos, who are reportedly extras on the hit show, were arrested as persons of interest last week before they were were released from custody without charges. WBBM reported that the pair are cooperating with authorities, with sources telling the news station that Smollett paid them $3,500 to orchestrate the attack.

The actor’s lawyers denied that the apparent hate crime was staged in the following statement to WBBM:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

California Sen. Kamala Harris called it ""an attempted modern-day lynching."" So did New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. (He used those exact same words.) ""This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color,"" tweeted New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

On and on it went. Why? Because it seemed so ready-made for politicians hoping to make a point about the poisoning of our culture by Trump and his ilk: Smollett is gay, black and an outspoken critic of Trump. Of course Trump supporters reacted violently!

Except, not. Chicago police had confirmed they were investigating a possible hate crime against Smollett when he reported it, but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case have told CNN the police now believe Smollett paid two men -- brothers -- to stage the attack on him . Smollett has denied that charge but has yet to speak again directly with the police about the circumstances surrounding the incident on January 29.

That news has led to a massive conservative counterattack -- on Democrats and the media who they argue were all too willing to cast Smollett as the victim of an attack, even though corroborating evidence was in short supply."

Natalie McCain, a 32-year-old photographer from Rockledge, Florida, took the stunning black and white images as part of The Honest Body Project, which aims to end body-shaming and show the next generation of young girls what real women look like.

For her latest shoot, her subjects headed to the beach and held up body-positive signs as they challenged the societal notion that women need to have a certain body type or weight before they are 'swimsuit ready.'

Natalie explained on her website that the women made their own signs and were encouraged to wear whatever bathing suit they felt comfortable in, whether it be a bikini or a one-piece.

'There are so many variations of bodies. There is not one size or one shape that is allowed to wear a bikini,' she wrote.

'If you want to wear one — do it! If you don’t, that’s fine too. The point of our message is to love your body and be proud of it.

'Society can’t dictate what you should wear.'

As part of the shoot, Natalie teamed up with Angie and Mike Sonrode from Mid Drift, a non-profit that works to change the conversation surrounding postpartum bodies.

In addition to the images, she has the women share their stories with the goal of ending societal stigmas and promoting self-love among women and mothers.

This Saturday, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the probe into the attack told CNN that police believed Smollett had actually paid two men to carry out the assault.

Kamala Harris says she won’t follow in the independent senator from Vermont’s footsteps.

Asked by Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy if she would have to run as a democratic socialist – which is how Sanders often describes himself, the Democrat from California quickly and bluntly answered that “I am not a democratic socialist.”

Harris spoke on Monday as she took questions from reporters during her in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire for the first time since launching her presidential campaign four weeks ago.

SANDERS POISED TO ANNOUNCE 2020 DECISION BY END OF FEBRUARY, SOURCES SAY

Sanders, a progressive populist who put up a serious fight against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, is likely to launch before the end of the month a second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

In recent weeks some Democrats have questioned whether Harris was a “progressive prosecutor” during her years as San Francisco district attorney and later as California attorney general.

Harris also vowed to spend “a lot of time” in New Hampshire.

“I’m here because I believe that this is a very important state and intend to spend a lot of time here, and I intend to compete for the votes here and I’m going to put a lot of effort into doing that,” Harris highlighted after being asked by Fox News if the state was a lower priority than the other early-voting states in the primary and caucus calendar.

“It’s an important state. It is a state of people who have a lot of needs and need to be seen and heard,” she spotlighted.

HARRIS GIVES AWKWARD RESPONSE WHEN ASKED ABOUT JUSSIE SMOLLETT CLAIMS

Harris is the daughter of parents from Jamaica and India and would be the first woman and second African-American to win the White House if she ultimately succeeds.

Even before her formal launch, the candidate headed to South Carolina, the first southern state to hold a primary. And she headed to Iowa – which votes first – a few days later.

Iowa and South Carolina -- a state where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate -- are likely to figure heavily into Harris’ prospects. Harris campaigned in support of fellow Democrats in South Carolina in last year’s midterm elections.

Harris vowed at the beginning of an event at Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord to spend lots of time campaigning in the Granite State. She repeated that pledge at a large event later Monday in Portsmouth.

Anti-Muslim Hate Crime In Michigan Turns Out To Be A Hoax (Nov. 2016)

A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention from national outlets like The Washington Post in November 2016 after she claimed a drunk 20-something man threatened to light her on fire if she didn’t remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax.

Volk told NBC News that “I just want them to stop.” But the “them” referenced by Volk turned out to be herself, as the whole thing was fabricated.

Gas Station Racism Goes Viral — Then Police Debunk It (Nov. 2016)

Philadelphia woman Ashley Boyer claimed in November 2016 that she was harassed at a gas station by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. Boyer claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.” Boyer deleted her post after it went viral and claimed the men had been caught and were facing criminal charges. Local police debunked her account.

White Men Rob Muslim Woman Of Her Hijab And Wallet — Except It Never Happened (Nov. 2016)

An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed in November 2016 that two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

Church Organist Vandalizes Own Church (Nov. 2016)

A church organist was arrested in May 2017 after he was found responsible for spray-painting a swastika, an anti-gay slur and the words “Heil Trump” on his own church in November 2016. When the story first broke, media outlets tied the hoax to Trump’s election. “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” The Washington Post reported at the time.

Fake Hate At Air Force Academy Goes Viral (Sept. 2017)

The Air Force Academy was thrown into turmoil in September 2017 when horrific racist notes were found at the academy’s preparatory school. “Go home n***er,” read one of the notes. The superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, went viral with an impassioned speech addressing the racist notes.

Student Faked Racist Notes (Dec. 2018)

Several racist notes at Drake University were actually the work of one of the students who had been targeted by them. “The fact that the actions of the student who has admitted guilt were propelled by motives other than hate does not minimize the worry and emotional harm they caused, but should temper fears,” university president Marty Martin said afterwards.

The Covington Catastrophe (Jan. 2019)

National media outlets pounced on a selectively edited video from the March for Life that showed Native American activist Nathan Phillips beating a drum in front of a boisterous group of boys from Covington Catholic High School.

Phillips originally told The Washington Post the students swarmed him while he was preparing to leave the Indigenous People’s March scheduled for the same day. Phillips originally said one student, who later identified himself as high school junior Nick Sandmann, blocked his path from leaving as he tried to do so. The extended video shows that wasn’t the case: Phillips approached the high school boys during their cheers, not the other way around. Some of the people with Phillips were directing racially charged language at the students, not the other way around.

Phillips told a second variation of his story to the Detroit Free Press. Phillips claimed he was playing the role of peacemaker by getting between the students and four “old black individuals,” whom he claimed the students were attacking. “They were in the process of attacking these four black individuals,” Phillip tolds the Michigan paper. “I was there and I was witnessing all of this … As this kept on going on and escalating, it just got to a point where you do something or you walk away, you know? You see something that is wrong and you’re faced with that choice of right or wrong.”

“These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey, and I stood in between them and so they needed their pounds of flesh and they were looking at me for that,” he added. Extended video shows that account also isn’t accurate. The four individuals Phillips referenced were members of the Black Hebrew Israelites and they launched racist and anti-gay slurs at the high school students, not the other way around.

Bonus: Anti-Semitic Vandal Exposed As Democratic Activist (Nov. 2018)

Anti-Semitic vandalism in New York City turned out to be the work of a Democratic activist, according to police. It wasn’t a hoax — the anti-Semitic vandalism was real — but the suspect wasn’t the right-winger some had assumed him to be. The man police arrested, based on surveillance footage, was 26-year-old James Polite, who had actually interned for City Hall on anti-hate issues.

Bonus II: Trump-Inspired Racist Blaze At Black Church Was Carried Out By Black Church-goer (Nov. 2016)



This hoax occurred one week before Trump was elected, but TheDCNF is including it as a bonus because it was so egregious. Leftist media outlets ran headlines like “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump” after a black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire and spray painted with the words “Vote Trump.” The Washington Post’s original coverage of the incident read in part,” Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons called the fire a ‘hateful and cowardly act,’ sparked by the incendiary rhetoric of GOP nominee Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.” But the church was set on fire by one of the church’s own congregants, who is black.

Chicago police sources have told various news outlets that Ola and Abel Osundairo have implicated Smollett in the attack, and that they accuse him of paying them to stage the ambush that he reported to the police.

CBS 2's Charlie De Mar obtained a short statement from the brothers on Monday.

""We are not racist,"" the statement read. ""We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

The statement is problematic for Smollett on various accounts since he claimed they shouted racist and homophobic insults at him during the attack.

Police apprehended the brothers when they arrived back in the Chicago area after leaving for Nigeria.

The brothers were first identified through surveillance video on the night of the alleged attack. Police searched their home and obtained materials that could have been used to stage the attack, including bleach and ski masks.

Smollett has continued to affirm that he is a victim of a racial attack in the case. In a statement released Sunday, his lawyer appeared to deny that the reports that one of the Osundairo brothers was involved in the ambush.

One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.

The statement also cast doubt on the reports from anonymous sources from within the Chicago police department.

At present time, Jussie and his attorney's have no inclination to respond to '""unnamed"" sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.

Police have said that if the department believed Smollett filed a false report that they would make sure he faces the consequences.

Here's the latest in the suspicious Smollett story:"

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” one source told CBS 2’s Brad Edwards, who reported “other sources corroborated that information.”

A letter contained “white powder” was delivered on January 22 to a Chicago set where Empire was filming in the days leading up to the alleged staged assault. In a statement to CNN, Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi confirmed a HAZMAT team scrambled to Cinespace Studios, where the program was being shot, after the letter was found.

The substance was found to be powdered aspirin.

According to TMZ, Smollett had received a letter at Fox studios which read “Die Black fag.”

The FBI is probing the matter, said Guglielmi.

CBS 2’s report comes after a press representative for Smollett said that the actor will not meet with police Monday as accusations swirl that he “orchestrated” the attack with two Nigerian brothers who were extras on Empire. “There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Crisis manager Anna Kavanagh said in a statement. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

On Sunday, Chicago police said they requested a follow-up interview with Smollett after receiving “new evidence” in their interrogations of the brothers, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, but would not comment on reports of the attack being staged. “We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told police that two masked men hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him and doused him with an unknown chemical substance as he walked home from a sandwich shop at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The actor said his assailants placed a thin rope around his neck and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before running away.

In a statement to ABC News, attorneys for Smollett said their client was “angered” and “further victimized” by accusations that orchestrated the alleged assault.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” they continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported on Saturday evening that at least one of the brothers picked up the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was purchased at the direction of Smollett, reported De Mar, added. Further, the brothers reportedly were compensated $3,500 and promised an additional $500 later.

Smollett could get between one to three years in prison if he is found to have filed a false report with the Chicago Police regarding his alleged attack, according to Illinois State law."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Two brothers from Nigeria have been identified as persons of interest in connection with the alleged attack on ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, Chicago police said late Thursday.

Officials said the two are affiliated with the show ""Empire"" and were detained on their arrival at O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday.

The police gave no further information about their specific roles or connections to the show but said the investigation continues.

Smollett filed a report with Chicago police on Jan. 29 stating that two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. He also told police that his attackers poured a chemical, possibly bleach, over him and put a noose around his neck.

Earlier Thursday, police said that ""through meticulous investigation"" they had identified two persons of interest.

""These individuals are not yet suspects but were in area of concern and are being questioned,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Later, police said they searched at least one property in connection with their investigation but that they still have no motive for the attack. Police have said they are investigating the alleged attack against Smollett, who is black and gay, as a possible hate crime.

In a statement to NBC News earlier on Thursday, a representative for Smollett welcomed the identification of two persons of interest.

""We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details,"" his representative said.

In his first interview about the incident, the actor told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he was angry about the alleged attack and at those who doubted his story.

Social media users began to cast doubt over his claims after police said they were not able to find video of the alleged attack.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,"" Smollett said. ""Then, it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that?' Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.""

""And then, it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth,'"" he said.

Police have said they have not found surveillance video that shows the alleged assault and battery, but they then released images of the ""potential persons of interest"" from a surveillance camera near where Smollett says he was attacked.

Chicago Police Supt. Eddie T. Johnson has said he has no reason to believe Smollett is ""not being genuine with"" investigators.

As for Smollett, the actor said the incident has left a deep mark.

""I will never be the man that this did not happen to,"" Smollett said. ""I am forever changed."""

“He had been in New York City for a reading of the play Take Me Out, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Smollett was being considered to appear in a possible revival of the Tony-winning production about a biracial baseball star who comes out as gay,” The Daily Mail reported. “The script for that play finds the lead character being attacked by a new pitcher who joins the team. That character uses the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‘f****t’ and ‘n****r.'”

Local Chicago media reported on Monday that sources indicated that they believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack on himself because there was not a “bigger reaction” to an allegedly racist letter that he received a week before the attack.

The latest developments in the Smollett case come after the case turned a corner late last week. CBS Chicago reported on Saturday:

Sources told CBS 2 News that Smollett paid the two men $3,500 to stage the attack in Streeterville. The brothers, seen on surveillance video near the scene of the alleged attack, told investigators Smollett directed them to buy the rope used in the incident, and paid for the purchase at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Ravenswood days before the incident. The brothers, who were questioned by police last week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack.

A report from The Blast on Monday indicated that FBI officials are still investigating who was behind the letter that Smollett received at the Fox studio where “Empire” is recorded.

Law enforcement officials were reportedly suspicious of Smollett’s story from early on for multiple reasons. TMZ reported on Sunday:

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera. And, there’s this. We’re told investigators didn’t believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Representatives for Smollett indicated on Monday that Smollett does not plan on meeting with Chicago police today after authorities said they wanted to question him after the recent developments in the case.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,” Smollett spokeswoman Anne Kavanagh said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”"

“When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” a source told CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards. Other sources corroborated that information.

CBS 2 reporter Charlie De Mar spoke on the phone with the Osundario brothers Monday afternoon, who said in a joint statement: “We are not racist. We are not homophobic, and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

Smollett received a letter containing a “white substance” at Empire‘s Chicago Cinespace Studios where the show is filmed, prompting a HAZMAT response that failed to gain much traction. The “white substance” was later found to be aspirin.

The note was crafted with letters apparently cut out from magazines to form words. The pieced-together message contained racial and homophobic threats directed at Smollett. A magazine is one of the pieces of evidence retrieved from the brother’s home last week during a search conducted by CPD. Investigators also recovered a book of stamps. The brothers are acquaintances of Smollett. When asked about the letter in a televised interview last week, Smollett said, “On the letter, it had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing toward it.” It also had “MAGA” — reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan Make America Great Again – written as the return address. “In due course all the facts will reveal themselves and at the end of the day my clients are honest and credible” the brothers’ attorney Gloria Schmidt said. –CBS 2 Chicago

Smollett appeared in a play with a similar “assault”

The Daily Mail reported on Monday that Smollett “landed in Chicago shortly after midnight” one day after he was in New York City for a reading of the play “Take Me Out,” which features a gay character who is attacked using “the same racial slurs Smollett told police his attackers screamed at him, including ‘f****t’ and ‘n****r.'”

On Monday, Smollett’s new crisis management rep Anne Kavanaugh reported “There are no plans for Jussie to meet with Chicago police today. Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett’s attorneys will keep dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett picked the wrong camera After the alleged “attack” on January 29 in which Smollett alleged that two attackers recognized him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him (from the reading he had just flown back from), beat him up, poured a bleach-like liquid on him, wrapped a noose around his neck, and warned him “This is MAGA country!” – Smollett made sure to tell Good Morning America last week that he spotted a surveillance camera that caught the entire incident. Alas, as Breitbart‘s John Nolte notes, Smollett then admitted his disappointment that the camera was facing the wrong way. And one can imagine, had there been surveillance footage of the attack, the investigation would have proceeded very, very differently. Once police had the footage, it would leak. Once cable and network news had the footage, it would loop endlessly. The fact that the two brothers are black wouldn’t matter. CBS Chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment. Smollett told police the attackers wore face masks. With those face masks, the organized left (the media, Democrats, celebrities) were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white.

Trump says he has been proven '100% right' following Israel's stunning claims that Iran is still running their nuclear program in secret in defiance of their agreement with the West.

Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised address on Monday evening during which he presented documents obtained from inside Iran, proving they are still following their A-bomb ambitions under the radar.

He said: 'Iran's leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,' said Netanyahu while standing in front of the documents, which senior Trump administration officials have said are authentic.

'Tonight I'm here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.'

Just minutes after the shocking announcement, Trump said: 'What's happening today, and what's happened over the last little while, and what we've learned, has really shown that I've been 100 per cent right.'

Later on Monday afternoon, Trump once more attacked the Iran deal as 'horrible'. He has until May 12 to decide whether to pull out of the accord.

'In seven years, that deal will have expired and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons,' Trump told a joint press conference with his Nigerian counterpart Muhammadu Buhari.

'That is not acceptable,' Trump charged. 'This is an agreement that wasn't approved by too many people. And it's a horrible agreement for the United States.'

The US president has been threatening for months to pull out of the 2015 deal negotiated between Tehran and six world powers, rejecting it as 'insane' partly because its restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities begin expiring in 2025.

Most world powers say the deal is working as intended for now and is the best way to keep Iran from acquiring the bomb.

'I'm not telling you what I'm doing, but a lot of people think they know,' Trump said. 'On or before the 12th, we'll make a decision.'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his intelligence services have obtained documents proving that Iran maintained a secret nuclear program in violation of a landmark agreement Tehran reached with the West. Netanyahu points to a slide which is purported to show 'massive safes' where Iran's 'secret archive' were stored

In the slide above, Netanyahu is pointing to 'U235—that's enriched uranium, right here at the core. That's the only place where you find in the core enriched uranium. And here's an Iranian simulation, original Iranian simulation putting all these components together'

The premier accused the Islamic Republic of 'brazenly lying' to the United States and Europe by maintaining nuclear materials in a secret location - a violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran's 'nuclear archives'

Netanyahu points to the above slide which he says proves Iran maintained a secret nuclear weapons program. The above object is a measuring device for implosions

The Israeli leader said that the 'atomic archive' where Iran kept its files was in the Shorabad District of the capital, Tehran

Netanyahu points to a slide that shows components of an alleged clandestine nuclear weapons program. 'Here's a design for a nuclear payload on a Shahab3 missile,' Netanyahu says, pointing to the missile above

The Israeli prime minister stands in front of dozens of binders filled with documents as well as hundreds of discs taken from the Iranians

Netanyahu has long argued that the nuclear deal has not prevented Iran from continuing to develop its program of long-range missiles capable of carrying an atomic warhead. 'They can reach Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Moscow, but they're working on far, far greater ranges,' Netanyahu said. 'They're planning much longer range missiles to carry nuclear weapons'

Netanyahu used a slide which he says confirmed that the covert program to develop nuclear weapons was authorized by Iran's defense minister in 2003

The Israeli leader says the documents include 'incriminating photos' that prove Iran is lying about its pursuit of a peaceful nuclear program. 'Here's a photo showing the casting process and a cast metal core, from the archives,' Netanyahu says of the above slide

The White House also said on Monday that information released by Israel on Iran's nuclear program provides 'new and compelling details' about Tehran's efforts to develop 'missile-deliverable nuclear weapons.'

'These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons program that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people,' the White House statement said.

Iranian state TV said on Monday that Netanyahu's accusations on Tehran's nuclear program was propaganda.

'His remarks was not new...full of baseless accusations... and propaganda against Iran's nuclear work,' state TV said.

Numerous other experts claimed all the information contained in the documents had been seen before.

The British government, meanwhile, insisted it had 'never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions' in the wake of the presentation.

British government: 'We have never been naive about Iran' Britain has never been 'naive' about Iran's nuclear programme, a spokesman for the government has said in the wake of Benjamin Netanyahu's speech. The spokesman also said inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are vital to ensure Iran's nuclear programme is used for peaceful means. 'We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions. That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords,' a British government spokesman said in a statement. 'It remains a vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal and that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.' Advertisement

Thousands of pages contained evidence that Tehran had a secret nuclear weapons program while insisting to the world its nuclear ambitions were purely peaceful, Netanyahu said.

While the lion's share of the briefing focused on what he said was past nuclear work and alleged obfuscation about it by Iran, Netanyahu asserted that such activities had continued after the deal that was meant to curb Iranian capabilities.

The premier accused the Islamic Republic of 'brazenly lying' to the United States and Europe by maintaining nuclear materials in a secret location - a violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Israel claims that it obtained the incriminating information within the past 10 days.

After the 2015 nuclear deal was signed, the documents were moved to a 'highly secret' location in Tehran, Netanyahu said.

While the lion's share of the briefing focused on what he said was past nuclear work and alleged obfuscation about it by Iran, Netanyahu asserted that such activities had continued after the 2015 deal that was meant to curb Iranian capabilities.

'These files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it says it never had a nuclear weapons program,' he said.

Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran's 'nuclear archives.'

Speaking in English, perhaps with an international audience in mind, he says the material is filled with incriminating evidence showing the Iranian program, called 'Project Amad,' was to develop a weapon.

Netanyahu's revelations were 'a big lot of nothing' according to David Patrikarakos, an Iranian nuclear politics expert.

He said the prime minister's comments 'are entirely political, designed to put pressure on – or given a excuse to – President Trump not to recertify the nuclear deal, which he is due to do in several days.

Critically Patrikarakos says that 'Netanyahu has presented little if any evidence that Iran is in breach of the deal, merely that 'past nuclear work' showed evidence of Iranian attempts at a nuclear weapons capability, which is true, and that Iran had been less than transparent in its nuclear dealings.

'All of this is well-known, what he has failed to show is that Iran is in violation of the nuclear deal signed it was signed in 2016.

'It may give Trump the excuse he needs, but it will not wash with the other parties to the deal namely France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China.'

Netanyahu wants the deal to fail because he has staked some much political capital on that outcome and wants the US and Iran at loggerheads as it helps Israel geopolitically, said Patrikarakos, author of Nuclear Iran: The Birth of an Atomic State, the first complete history of Iran's nuclear program from it's beginnings in the 1950s to the present day, and war in 140 Characters: How Social Media Is Reshaping Conflict in The 21st Century.

While Netanyahu presented the information as new, the details of Project Amad were known to Western governments well before the 2015 nuclear deal, according to The Atlantic.

In 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency published findings about Project Amad, which was shut down by the Iranians in 2003.

The French ambassador to Washington, Gerard Araud, tweeted that information about past Iranian nuclear activity was in fact an argument in favor of the nuclear deal, not against it.

Trump is to decide by May 12 whether to pull out of the international deal with Iran.

President Donald Trump used the revelations to insist that he's been proved '100 per cent right' about Iran, minutes after Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised address on Monday evening during which he presented documents obtained from inside Iran

Federica Mogherini, the head of the European Union's foreign policy portfolio, said that it appears Netanyahu's presentation did not demonstrate that Iran was violating the nuclear deal.

'What I have seen from the first reports is that Prime Minister Netanyahu has not put into question Iran's compliance with the JCPOA commitments, meaning post-2015 nuclear commitments,' her office said in a statement.

'The JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, is not based on assumptions of good faith or trust - it is based on concrete commitments, verification mechanisms and a very strict monitoring of facts, done by the IAEA.

'The IAEA has published 10 reports, certifying that Iran has fully complied with its commitments.'

Faced with mounting pressure, Iran has threatened to resume 20 percent uranium enrichment if the US leaves the deal.

Before Netanyahu's speech, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the Israeli leader was 'the boy who can't stop crying wolf [and is] at it again'

Raz Tzimmt, an expert on Israel-Iran relations, said it will be very difficult to persuade Iran to renegotiate.

'I think it will be very difficult if not impossible to persuade the Iranians to renegotiate the deal,' said Tzimmt.

'I mean the perception in Iran is that Iran has already given up some part of its capabilities during the negotiations with P5+1 and the United States.

'So I think it will be almost impossible to believe that under no circumstances, including more economic pressure on Iran, Iran, and especially Supreme Leader Khamenei, is going to agree for a better deal,' said Tzimmt.

Tzimmt said if Iran resumes its nuclear activity, Israel will possibly take action, with military options most likely on the table.

'In case Iran breaks out for nuclear weapons and quits the NPT and expels the IAEA inspectors from Iran, that would mean that Iran is not just after resuming its nuclear activity, but about its bomb.

'And then I think we could expect Israel to take more radical actions, including military options against Iran, because Israel has always made it very clear that it will not allow Iran to become a nuclear military state.'

Trump said Monday that stunning revelation from Israel about Iran's secret nuclear weapons program shows that he has had Tehran's mullah's pegged.

'What's happening today, and what's happened over the last little while, and what we've learned, has really shown that I've been 100 per cent right,' the president told reporters at the White House.

Netanyahu has led calls for Trump to withdraw from the nuclear deal, which was one of Obama's signature foreign policy achievements.

Netanyahu's speech on the Iran nuclear deal follows the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to Israel on Sunday

Netanyahu said that Iran had lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons and had continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge after signing the JCPOA.

'Iran's leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,' said Netanyahu.

'Tonight I'm here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.'

'After signing the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret files,' he said.

'In 2017 Iran moved its nuclear weapons files to a highly secret location in Tehran.'

Netanyahu said that Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.

His speech follows the visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday, during which the pair discussed Iran and the accord.

The Israeli premier has repeatedly called for the accord between world powers and his country's main enemy to either be altered or scrapped.

The JCPOA – known outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as 'The Iran Deal' – called for the U.S. to relax international sanctions and cut loose $150 billion in frozen Iranian funds and assets, in exchange for Tehran's pledge that it would pare back its nuclear weapons ambitions and limit its ability to enrich uranium and other fissile material.

Netanyahu has long criticized the deal and welcomed the Trump administration's pledge to withdraw next month if it is not improved.

He has welcomed a pledge by U.S. President Trump to decide on whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, putting in peril the 2015 nuclear accord, next month.

Pompeo has warned that the United States will withdraw from the agreement 'if we can't fix it'.

The Israeli premier has repeatedly called for the accord between world powers and his country's main enemy to either be altered or scrapped.

He alleges the agreement does not prevent Iran from eventually obtaining nuclear weapons and says the lifting of sanctions has increased Tehran's ability to finance proxy militants in the Middle East.

Most world powers however say the nuclear deal is working as intended for now and is the best way to keep Iran from acquiring the bomb.

Before Netanyahu's speech, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the Israeli leader was 'the boy who can't stop crying wolf [and is] at it again.'

Zarif said on Saturday that demands by Trump to change Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers were unacceptable.

Trump has said that unless European allies fix the 'terrible flaws' in the Iran nuclear deal by May 12, he will refuse to extend US sanctions relief for oil-producing Iran.

Israel is also deeply concerned over Iran's presence in Syria, where it is backing President Bashar al-Assad's

Israeli officials have not commented on Monday's overnight airstrike that killed Iranians inside neighboring Syria, but officials have warned Iran against trying to attack Israeli targets.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning that an overnight missile attack in the country's northern region has killed 26 pro-government fighters, mostly Iranians.

Th Observatory says the attack appears to have been carried out by Israel and targeted an arms depot for surface-to-surface missiles at a base in northern Syria known as Brigade 47.

Tehran has sent thousands of Iran-backed fighters to back President Bashar Assad's forces in the country's seven-year civil war.

Earlier on Monday, Syrian TV reported a 'new aggression,' with missiles targeting military outposts in northern Syria.

The state-run television reported that the missiles targeted military outposts in the Hama and Aleppo countryside.

Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that his country is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is 'not merely' the United States and European countries.

'I don't believe in cutting ties with the world but relying on the outside of the borders is a mistake within a mistake,' Khamenei was quoted as saying.

'We must certainly be wise, smart and resolute in our relations with the world, but we should also know that the world is not merely America and several European countries.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is 'not merely' the United States and European countries

'The world is big and (we) must have relations with different countries,' he added, according to extracts of a speech he gave in Tehran published on his website.

Khamenei is also quoted as blasting the US Treasury Department, denouncing it as an 'economic war chamber against the system of the Islamic republic.'

Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has adopted a tough stance against Iran and repeatedly denounced the landmark nuclear deal which Tehran reached with world powers to curb its nuclear program.

Trump has said the deal - which Iran signed with Britain, France, China, Russia, the United States and Germany - must be 'fixed' by May 12 or Washington will walk away.

Most world powers however say the nuclear deal is working as intended for now and is the best way to keep Iran from acquiring the bomb.

During Sunday's speech, Khamenei also accused the United States of waging an 'economic and cultural war' against Iran, according to his website."

“Democratic presidential candidates jockeying for position in 2020 had a lot to say when actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago by two white men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him,” recalls The Washington Examiner’s Dominick Mastrangelo. Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, for example, both characterized the incident as “a modern-day lynching.” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand likewise jumped to an unfounded conclusion, railing against this “sickening and outrageous attack,” and adding: “It’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color.” How did these same Democrats react to the weekend revelation that Smollett had likely staged the whole thing, per Chicago police sources? As Mastrangelo archly notes: “They were silent.”

Numbers cruncher: Democratic Socialist’s Good Idea

Believe it or not, Brooklyn state Sen. Julia Salazar, a newly elected democratic socialist, is pushing an idea that the Empire Center’s E.J. McMahon says “could appeal to limited-government conservatives across New York.” Her End of Corporate Welfare Act establishes “a multi-state compact that would bar member states from offering any ‘company-specific subsidy,’ ” including development grants and deferred tax liability. The bill would have knocked out “a large portion” of the just-aborted Amazon deal, which included a company-specific $500 million state capital grant. Insisting on a multi-state compact is a shortcoming, he says, though it is meant to address any complaints that New York couldn’t compete for corporate investments. But, asks McMahon, “why compete at all” in what Salazar rightly describes as “a subsidy-waving ‘race to the bottom’ ”?

Policy wonks: High-Speed Rail Won’t Leave the Station

Sponsors of the Green New Deal must now recognize what California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s cancellation of a massive high-speed rail project linking San Francisco and Los Angeles means, suggest Joel Kotkin and Wendell Cox at City Journal: “If high-speed rail is not feasible in the state with the three densest major metro areas in the nation, and the highest overall urban density, it is not feasible anywhere else in the United States.” Which certainly undercuts advocates’ vision of a massive network of high-speed trains to kill the internal-combustion engine. Yes, such systems exist in western Europe, but the distance between cities there is much shorter. Besides, only two such lines (Tokyo-Osaka and Paris-Lyon) are profitable. And in both cases, highway tolls for the same route exceed $80 each way, making rail much more attractive.

Scribe: Muslim Politicos Should Speak Carefully on Israel

Anti-Semitism “has spread through the Islamic world like a cancer,” contends Fareed Zakaria at The Washington Post — which is why Muslims like Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib “should be particularly thoughtful” when speaking about Israel and “its most ardent American supporters.” An Anti-Defamation League survey of 100 nations found anti-Semitism “twice as common among Muslims than among Christians” and “far more prevalent in the Middle East than the Americas.” It “should be possible” to criticize Israel and even to question the influence of AIPAC, its chief US lobby. But by phrasing the issue as Omar and Tlaib have done — with suggestions of Jewish money buying support — “they have squandered an opportunity to further that important debate.”

Religion watch: How Africa Is Converting China

Much has been made of the influx of Chinese money and workers into Africa over the past two decades, notes Christopher Rhodes at UnHerd. ­Indeed, China is now Africa’s primary economic partner. But it turns out China is importing something else besides natural resources: “religion, and particularly evangelical Christianity,” which Beijing has “been trying to eliminate at home.” Chinese workers in Africa feel alienated, he says, and many have found in faith “a source of comfort.” Evangelicalism “pervades much of sub-Saharan Africa,” and Chinese, “heavily discouraged from practicing religion at home, are attractive converts.” When they return home, they have been bringing their newfound religion with them. Meanwhile, African migrants, practitioners of that same faith, “are also moving to China in larger numbers.” All of which is “creating a headache for the Communist Party.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann & Sohrab Ahmari"
