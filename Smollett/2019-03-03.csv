Before Smollett’s tale of being of a victim of an attack by two men yelling pro-Trump slogans fell apart, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of many who vouched for his character, blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such an attack. Waters said: “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom, and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on.”

This “man of impeccable character and integrity” appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America two weeks ago, where an oh-so-sympathetic Robin Roberts interviewed him. Smollett, at times tearing up, described the pain of being attacked by racist Trump-supporting homophobes. But he also described his second painful experience, that of being doubted. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black,” Smollett told Roberts, “I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett’s alleged hoax raised many interesting questions, one of which is this: How often do people lie to or about the police?

In 2012 in the city of Rialto, Calif., with a population of approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, a follow-up analysis showed use-of-force incidents on the shifts with body cams were down 59% compared to those without cameras. But something else rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers — with or without body cams — were down 87.5% from the prior year.

Why? It was not because officers changed their behaviour. They applied the same training they used before body cams. It was the civilians who changed their behaviour. It turned out that when civilians knew they were being recorded, they behaved better and stopped making false accusations. Civilians — aware that they might be taped — became less confrontational, followed officers’ instructions more readily and did not engage in the kind of resistant behaviour as before random cops were required to use body cams. As a result, officers did not have to use the kind of force previously needed.

A 20-year veteran Rialto police officer told me: “Newspapers make you think that the cameras made us change what we did and how we went about our business ‘because the cops were being watched.’ That’s not true. The cameras made the civilians stop lying about us, reduced the mouthing off and the kind of resistance we used to see.”

The city of Rialto is not alone in experiencing an almost 90% drop in officer complaints as a result of body cams.

A 2016 Cambridge University study of five police stations in the U.K. (in England and Northern Ireland) and two in the U.S. (including Rialto) found the same result. Complaints against the police fell 93% when some officers were randomly assigned body cams. Jayne Sykes of the West Yorkshire Police Department said: “Anecdotally, in terms of bringing offenders to justice, our Crown Prosecution Service have said to us on numerous occasions that the video footage has tipped the ballot in favour of prosecution, whereas without it, they may not have been able to prosecute. And also, again anecdotally, we’re getting more early guilty plea from suspects which saves the victim the trauma of having to go to court and give evidence.”

Barack Ariel from Cambridge’s Institute of Criminology, one of the authors of Cambridge’s study, says that in the original Rialto study, the drop in complaints against police translated into a savings of US$4 in complaint litigation for every $1 spent on the installation of body cams.

In the last two years, there have been several hate crimes later exposed as hoaxes. Nikki Joly, a Michigan LGBT activist lost his house in a 2017 fire, which killed his two dogs and three cats inside the home. Two days later, the activist exhorted his followers “to be angry, be very angry.” The police quickly determined it was arson, while the FBI investigated it as a hate crime. As a result of his “plight,” the activist, called “citizen of the year” by a local newspaper, received $58,000 in donations. But a year later, the police charged the activist with setting the fire.

When Smollett’s hate crime claim imploded, Roberts called Smollett’s story “a setback for race relations.” About the assertion made by many blacks that cops engage in “systemic” or “structural” or “institutional” racism, one must ask this question: What impact do false accusations against cops play in pushing the “cops are out to get us” narrative?

Rank enough that “Saturday Night Live” is actually attempting comedy. And kind of succeeding!

Yeah, I know, “SNL” has mostly devolved into “Orange Man be bad” kind of stuff, but “Shark Tank Legal Edition” may be one of the best sociopolitical sketches I’ve seen on the show in years. And keep in mind, I’ve laughed at some of the better George W. Bush sketches, although everyone kind of knew where the show was headed from there.

The premise of the sketch involves the basic “Shark Tank” premise of a business pitch delivered to a panel who then either passes on the pitch or bids for the idea. The panel, however, is made up of lawyers and the “pitches” are legal propositions.

As for the panel members, there’s “the porn lawyer who might just run for president,” Michael Avenatti. (“Sorry if I’m nervous,” Pete Davidson-as-Avenatti says. “I hate being on TV.”) Then there’s “Fox News banshee” Jeanine Pirro. (Look, it’s still “SNL.”)

And then there was “Alan Dershowitz,” who delivered a line I’m not quite sure even the writers knew the import of: “After I started defending Trump, nobody invited me to parties anymore. I wish I could go back to defending good people, like O.J. (Simpson).” Rudy Giuliani and Cellino and Barnes also made appearances.

Smollett was the second contestant on “Shark Tank Legal Edition” (after Robert Kraft, on there for reasons you might already imagine).

“Hey everyone, you won’t believe this but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” Chris Redd-as-Smollett said.

“Jussie, is that true?” John Mulaney-as-Dershowitz asked Smollett.

“Are there cameras outside?” Smollett responded.

“Yes,” Dershowitz said.

“Then no, it is not.”

Well, hey. Maybe the cameras were facing north. Avenatti then asked Smollett why he was there.

“I broke humanity?” he responded. “But if you take my case, I’m offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire.’ I die.”

Of course, there was the usual “SNL” commentary on Fox News in the person of Pirro: “A gay black man lying about an attack,” Cecily Strong’s version of the pundit wrote. “I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this but I never thought it would come true.”

“Jussie, you’ve got everything I love in a client. You’re famous. You’re probably guilty. End of list,” Dershowitz said.

It’s worth noting that the real Dershowitz actually suggested a biblical punishment for Smollett if found guilty: “You know in the Bible, if you falsely accuse somebody you get the penalty that the person would have gotten had the accusation been true, so if in fact these people had attacked him in this racist way and put a noose around his neck, they would have gotten some years in jail,” he told Fox News.

The sketch was good enough that it even prompted Michael Avenatti to try on a Trump impression:

Pete Davidson, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me tonight on SNL, is a punk kid. Pete, it was agony for those who were forced to watch your ridiculous hairline. Bring back Steve Martin, funnier and a far greater talent! Sad!!!!!!!! — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 3, 2019

I’d say stick to the legal field but, well, he’s not doing so hot there these days either.

Either way, this is pretty much one of the better summations of everything wrong with the Smollett case. Salacious accusation that can’t be backed up by facts? Check. Story not really lining up with cameras? Check. Playing on the emotions and reputations of stars and politicians, thusly “breaking humanity?” Check.

If only they’d had him walk in with a totally undamaged Subway footlong — that would have been perfect.

“Saturday Night Live” dived into the Jussie Smollett mess with a tough “Shark Tank” spoof called “Shark Tank: Legal Edition.” Controversial lawyers — from Michael Avenatti ( Pete Davidson ) to Rudy Giuliani ( Kate McKinnon ) and Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro ( Cecily Strong ) listened to pitches from celebrities in hot water pleading with them to take their cases.

“Hey everybody, you won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” says Chris Redd’s Smollett as the audience groans. The actor has been accused by Chicago police of staging a hate attack on himself because he was unhappy with his salary on “Empire.” When Redd is told there are surveillance cameras outside, he drops his story.

“Jussie, why exactly are you here today,” Davidson’s Avenatti asks.

“I broke humanity?” Redd’s Smollet responds. “But if you take my case, I’m offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire.’ I die.”

Pirro recuses herself because she’s just “too turned on” that a gay black man is in trouble.

Beck Bennett played the first contestant, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft , who was recently charged with solicitation of prostitution .

“Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so-happy ending,” Bennett’s Kraft said. “I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.”

Avenatti later quipped in a tweet that he would play Davidson next week.

Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo and Olabinjo 'Ola Osundairo have spoken of their ""tremendous regret"" at being involved in the scandal and said sorry for the negative impact they may have had on other people, particularly those who were victims of hate crimes

4 March 2019

A statement issued by their attorney to CBS Chicago read: ""My clients have tremendous regret over their involvement in this situation, and they understand how it has impacted people across the nation, particularly minority communities and especially those who have been victims of hate crimes themselves.""



The 'Empire' actor told police in January he had been attacked by two masked men in Chicago, who had abused him with racist and homophobic language, doused him with a chemical substance and tied a rope around his neck.



The two brothers - who knew Jussie from working on 'Empire' and attending the same gym - were arrested last month but were released after telling police about the alleged hoax.



Authorities believe the 36-year-old actor paid the men to stage the attack to draw attention to himself in a bid to get a salary increase, but he has denied the claims.



Jussie was arrested last month on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct and ordered to pay a $10,000 bond and surrender his passport.



His character, Jamal Lyon, was subsequently dropped from the final two episodes of the current season of ''Empire' in order to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show.



The actor has been praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.



The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.



""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.



""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""



It is currently not clear if the Osundairo brothers will face any charges.

Barr, an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, was abruptly fired from her own show “Roseanne” — which had just been brought back to television and earned monster ratings — after she put out a tweet that some deemed to be racist.

The tweet targeted former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.

MORE NEWS: Guest: Pastor Darrell Scott

Barr said Jarrett was a cross between the “Muslim brotherhood and ‘Planet of the Apes.'” Considering Jarrett is black, there was immediate backlash against the tweet. Barr apologized multiple times for the tweet and insisted she did not know Jarrett’s race at the time.

She said her tweet was more of a criticism of Jarrett’s foreign policies.

Who do you think is going to win the upcoming Presidential election? President Donald Trump Joe Biden Email Address (required) By completing the poll, you agree to receive emails from LifeZette and that you've read and agree to our privacy policy and legal statement Results Vote

Yet ABC fired Barr from the successful, and politically unbiased, show despite her apology. Barr eventually even signed away all financial and creative rights to the very show she had created. Still, this was not enough. The media and fellow celebrities smeared her as a racist. Her apologies and reparations meant nothing to anybody.

Cut to Jussie Smollett. The “Empire” star and outspoken critic of Trump came out with a story weeks ago saying he was physically attacked by two white men wearing Make America Great Again hats in Chicago in the early morning.

He claimed the men yelled, “MAGA country!” while attacking him. He even said the men put a noose around his neck.

MORE NEWS: NOLA Protests

Despite Smollett’s story changing several times, he wasn’t questioned all that much. Liberal politicians and celebrities immediately threw their support behind the actor. He even landed a cushy, softball interview on “Good Morning America” about the alleged attack.

Smollett has now been charged by police with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. He continues to insist on his innocence through his lawyers, but Chicago police have said they believe Smollett faked the entire attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary on “Empire.”

Police allege the actor paid two Nigerian brothers who were extras on “Empire” to carry out the “attack.” They also allege Smollett gave himself injuries. There is also now video footage of the brothers buying masks and rope for a noose before the attack.

Smollett has not been fired from “Empire.” Many celebrities continue to defend his crumbling account of events.

Others simply refuse to acknowledge the possibility that this man likely faked a hate crime.

There is no world where a bad joke tweet measures up to faking an evil hate crime. The difference in the treatment of Smollett compared to the treatment of Barr by mainstream Hollywood is disgusting — and shows clear as daylight that this is an industry willing to forgive just about anything, as long as someone is on the “right side.”

Think about it: In this current environment, all it takes for someone to lose everything they’ve worked for over a long period of time is … a tweet.

Mulaney revealed on social media that he and writers Simon Rich (creator of TBS' Miracle Workers) and Marika Sawyer had been pitching last night's ""Toilet Death Ejector"" skit since 2009, which was shortly after he boarded the series as a writer, but it kept getting cut. This week, though, that long-simmering potty invention infomercial finally got its SNL debut, and Mulaney was delighted that it didn't get flushed this time.

Simon Rich and Marika Sawyer and I wrote together every week for four years. Here we are in 2009 when we wrote ""Toilet Death Ejector"" and swipe for us in 2019 (with a chimp puppet) when we finally got it on tonight after it was cut twice! We wrote Whats That Name and brought it back tonight. They're the greatest friends and writers in the world.

The trio were also responsible for putting together the original ""What's that Name?"" skit back in 2010, so Mulaney was also jazzed to revive that bit this week. Bill Hader was already on hand for the week's cold open and doubled down on his guest star status to reprise his role as Blight the game show host who challenges contestants to remember the names of their real-life friends as well as they do celebrities.

Other highlights from Mulaney's latest stint on the show include his ""Cha Cha Slide"" routine that highlights the awkwardness of the obligatory wedding line dance and the ""Legal Shark Tank"" segment which features him as Alan Dershowitz alongside some similarly divisive TV lawyers: Pete Davidson's Michael Avenatti, Cecily Strong's Jeanine Pirro, and Kate McKinnon's Rudy Giuliani. The quartet entertain a bevy of representation requests from the most embattled personalities of late, including Beck Bennett as Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Chris Redd as Empire's Jussie Smollett.

The trio were also responsible for putting together the original ""What's that Name?"" skit back in 2010, so Mulaney was also jazzed to revive that bit this week. Bill Hader was already on hand for the week's cold open and doubled down on his guest star status to reprise his role as Blight the game show host who challenges contestants to remember the names of their real-life friends as well as they do celebrities.

Other highlights from Mulaney's latest stint on the show include his ""Cha Cha Slide"" routine that highlights the awkwardness of the obligatory wedding line dance and the ""Legal Shark Tank"" segment which features him as Alan Dershowitz alongside some similarly divisive TV lawyers: Pete Davidson's Michael Avenatti, Cecily Strong's Jeanine Pirro, and Kate McKinnon's Rudy Giuliani. The quartet entertain a bevy of representation requests from the most embattled personalities of late, including Beck Bennett as Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Chris Redd as Empire's Jussie Smollett.

The skit depicted four celebrity lawyers (Pete Davidson as Michael Avenatti, John Mulaney as Alan Dershowitz, Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro and Kate McKinnon as Rudy Giuliani) competing for the chance to represent recent celebrities-in-crisis like Smollett and Kraft in court.

“If you pick me, I will happily go on TV, contradict everything you’ve ever said and then add some additional damaging information free of charge,” McKinnon’s Giuliani character said to Kraft.

Chris Redd later arrived in character as Jussie Smollett, where he claimed to be attacked by Donald Trump himself outside the studio. When asked if that was true, he responded with a question about the building’s security cameras before revealing he was lying.

“Wow a gay black man lying about an attack! I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this but I never thought it would come true,” Strong said in character as Jeannie Pirro. “I’m recusing myself because I’m just too turned on.”

Last month, Jussie Smollett was arrested on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. The Empire actor was investigated after claims that he was attacked by two men in an apparent hate crime were later believed to be false. Watch SNL’s take on the whole situation below."

Neither the suspect, Zachary Greenberg, nor the man he is accused of punching, Hayden Williams, a field representative of the Leadership Institute, an organization that provides training to conservative campus groups, was a student at the university.

The attack Feb. 19 took place at Sproul Plaza, the birthplace and symbol of the Free Speech movement, the protests by students in the 1960s demanding greater political expression. Williams was helping a campus group that was recruiting members.

Conservative groups said the assault on Williams served as a symbol of what they say is continued intolerance toward conservative views on college campuses. Williams appeared on Fox News programs with a black eye, and videos of his assault were widely shared on social media.

The episode was only a faint echo of the brawl at the Berkeley campus in February 2017 when a group clad in black clothing and carrying sticks smashed windows, threw rocks at police and stormed a building in response to a planned speech by right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, causing around $100,000 in damage.

In an interview, Williams said he and the students he was seeking to train had made signs supporting President Donald Trump and criticizing Jussie Smollett, an actor who has been charged in connection with his own assault in Chicago. One of the signs said, “This is MAGA country,” Williams said.

Two men are seen in multiple videos of the episode approaching Williams, who begins filming them. One man points to the signs and accuses Williams of “encouraging violence.”

A man is then seen pushing Williams, showering him with expletives and delivering a powerful right hook to his face.

A university spokeswoman said campus police would present the case to the Alameda County district attorney for the filing of criminal charges.

In a statement, Carol Christ, chancellor of the university, called the attack “reprehensible.”

“That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” the chancellor said. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

Bryan Bernys, head of the Campus Leadership Program at the Leadership Institute, accused the Berkeley campus of encouraging “a culture that fosters this type of horrible behavior toward anyone or anything that you disagree with.”

The Leadership Institute runs a website called Campus Reform, which says it “exposes the liberal bias and abuse against conservatives on America’s colleges and universities.”

Now Playing:

“What does it say about Berkeley that this gentleman felt that he could go up and basically sucker-punch or cold-cock Hayden in the middle of a public square for no other reason than he disagreed with some of his speech and the signs that were out there,” Bernys said.

Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, described Greenberg as a “lone actor.”

“Many people seem to think that somehow this university of all places should have the ability to prevent all crime even when it’s the responsibility of a lone, crazy individual,” Mogulof said.

As a measure of its commitment to ideological pluralism, Mogulof said the university spent $4 million last year for security and logistics to host conservative speakers, among them Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator and presidential candidate; Dennis Prager, a conservative talk show host; and Heather Mac Donald, a conservative writer and political commentator.

After his career as an SNL writer, it’s nice that the crew at Studio 8H have come to see John Mulaney as a performer. Could be his increasingly masterful stand-up sets, including the 2017 Netflix special Kid Gorgeous at Radio City. Could be his run of Oh, Hello on Broadway with Nick Kroll. Could be his successful turn as host last year, with sketches ambitious (“Lobster Diner”) and clever (“Sitcom Reboot”). Could be the just-released, loving parody of Company: Original Cast Album he wrote with Seth Meyers and (yes, yes, yes) musical director Eli Bolin for IFC’s Documentary Now! Ultimately, who cares why he’s back? It’s nice to have a sketch in the hands of someone who knows how to make it work.

Bodega Bathroom

In Big Nick’s Bodega, they’ve got water, snacks and, if you require it in an emergency, a terrible, terrible bathroom. A guy (Davidson) asks the bodega owner (Mulaney) for a key while the guy’s pal (Redd) looks on in horror. The bodega cat (Thompson) directs the guy to the toilet while singing a ditty called “Zero Sanitation” — sung to the tune of “Pure Imagination,” from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. From there, a pair of singing cockroaches (Strong, Villaseñor) and a Audrey II-like toilet (Beck Bennett) start belting, too. There’s a version of “The Candy Man” strictly for the bodega guy, a take on “Memory” sung by a lifesize Virgin Mary votive (McKinnon), and very Oompa Loompa-like Sour Patch Kids (Aidy Bryant, Mikey Day, Kyle Mooney) singing about the swine HPV one will get from the toilet seat. The whole thing climaxes with a “Seasons of Love” parody that lists all of the things one might find in the bodega. “What about Fla-a-a-an?” the ensemble wants to know. Since when does a megamusical sketch parody get a second beat? This could become Mulaney’s SNL signature: megamusical mashups based on observations of very specific New York phenomena. This one is fantastic, too.

Michael Cohen Hearing Cold Open

Michael Cohen (Ben Stiller) arrives in Congress to testify before representatives about Trump, whom he characterizes as a racist, a cheat and a con man. “Wow, I thought that would get a bigger reaction,” he says upon hearing a distinct lack of gasps. Chairman Elijah Cummings (Thompson) prepares everyone for Republicans to “get mad at everybody but the president.” Ohio’s Jim Jordan (Bill Hader) fumes and flubs all of his good material; Arizona’s Paul Gosar (Kyle Mooney) stumbles over words and renders himself nearly incomprehensible; North Carolina’s Mark Meadows (Moffat) drags out a Trump employee he calls Omarosa (Ego Nwodim) to prove the president isn’t racist. Meanwhile, Jackie Speier (Heidi Gardner) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Kate McKinnon) just prank Jordan. And everybody just waits for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villaseñor) to take the stage. While it’s overstuffed, it does feel a bit more focused than past weeks. Stiller is good, but Hader and Mooney both shine here.

John Mulaney’s Monologue

Mulaney brings some of his own really solid material to this monologue, which includes bits about cocaine, subway announcements, convincing your Jewish fiancée to convert to Catholicism, and what it means to run into Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in New York while pushing a bulldog in a stroller. It’s Mulaney, so the observations are playful and the jokes are crisp. The set reaches its crescendo when Mulaney talks about (and does impressions of) different sorts of police sirens. The new “funky” ones make the comic feel like there’s a DJ in the back of the car; the classic ones (as heard in classic films) sound like “an old gay cat was dying.” No, no, not in a bad way — the cat “lived a full life, surrounded by loved ones, holding hands with a rabbi.” The entire set is worthwhile, but this very silly bit kills.

What’s That Name?

In another beat of this sadistic game show, contestants Doug (Mulaney) and Courtney (Cecily Strong) are simply asked to identify people by name. First, host Vince Blake (Hader) shows them pictures of Chrissy Teigen and Lil Xan— easy enough, five bucks for each of them. Then they’re offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to ID their best friend’s girlfriend and the wife of their business partner, respectively. They can’t, and Blake mocks them for their failure. In particular, Blake picks on the visibly uncomfortable Doug, who can’t properly name just one of his wife’s bridesmaids — even when provided three of the four letters in her name. “Why do you do this? What do you want?” Doug cries out. Blake says, “In a word: Chaos.” The game show element is still incredibly fun, and digging into the life and psychology of Blake makes this sketch deliciously dark, too. And Hader is wickedly precise in delivering lines like the one about his “problematic bachelor” friends who call themselves “the Squad.”

Weekend Update

At the top of Update, Colin Jost compares Michael Cohen to images that appeared on the internet this week of the fat, German rat stuck in a manhole cover: “Usually gross but you kinda feels sorry for it. Michael Che wishes Cohen wouldn’t play the “damsel in distress” after “stealing the presidency.” “At least Donald Trump has the decency to slowly fall apart until he’s dragged off in handcuffs — like a boss,” Che says. “That’s how I want to leave SNL.”

After a couple of shots at Trump’s failed summit in North Korea, Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant come on as Vaneta and Wylene Starkie of Smokery Farms. Due to the spread of veganism and internet sensations such as Picasso the Pig, these ladies decided to kill and sell only stupid, bad livestock. They display a basket of meat, pointing out that a steak came from “a cow that bit a kid in the wiener” and chops from a lamb “who would not stop body-shaming the goats.” Everything about this segment wins: the writing, the hair, the costumes, Bryant and McKinnon giggling together and a meat basket that smells disgusting, apparently. Comparatively little happens in the shorter second half of Update, and none of the remaining jokes hit all that well. There’s an R. Kelly joke, a Jussie Smollett joke, and a joke about a new line of Target underwear: “Lingerie that’ll have your man saying, ‘Not tonight.’ ”

To Have and Have Not

As Cinema Classics host Reese De’What (Thompson) reminds viewers, the scene from the classic Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall flick To Have and Have Not is primarily remembered for its line, “You know how to whistle, don’t you? Just put your lips together and blow.” The first time Bacall (McKinnon) tries to demonstrate whistling technique for Bogey (Mulaney), it’s obvious she has no idea what she’s doing. The sound is something like a stampeding elephant. In subsequent attempts, she spits, stuffs fingers in her mouth and hollers, sings “Guantanamera,” and stops to wonder if she’s gay. The idea may be silly, but with McKinnon in charge, it’s a series of carefully crafted moments of mugging and physical business. She’s also having a ball.

Legal Shark Tank

Lawyers Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), Alan Dershowitz (Mulaney), and Rudy Giuliani (McKinnon) — as well as the ubiquitous personal injury attorneys Cellino and Barnes (Alex Moffat and Kyle Mooney) — consider pitches from would-be clients who need legal help. The first is Patriots owner Robert Kraft (Beck Bennett), who may be “the first person to take a private jet to get a $50 hand job.” The second is Jussie Smollett (Chris Redd), who swears he was attacked by Donald Trump outside the studio … until he’s told there are cameras there. “A gay, black man lying about an attack,” Pirro gushes, “I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this, but I never thought it would come true!” Essentially, the format is an excuse to take shots at these infamous figures in the news, as well as the collection of eccentrics committed to helping them. It’s fast-paced, quippy, and perfectly brutal at times, too.

Chad Horror Movie

This Scream parody finds the recurring character Chad (Davidson) ostensibly tortured by a masked villain (Mulaney) over the phone. Given the usual tenor of the monosyllabic cipher, terrorizing him is not easy. The villain can hardly even get Chad to put on pants, much less truly take in a dead body or face the fact that he’s about to be stabbed. “I’m going to kill you, Chad,” the villain (whose real name is Ferguson) says when he finally shows up. Chad’s response, “No, thanks.” And though Chad did some seemingly terrible things to poor Ferguson, the universe has already chosen its golden child. It’s not a timely parody, but the Chad character has had enough of a break to make this a worthy return.

Toilet Death Ejector

This new product aims to calm old folks who are afraid of dying on the toilet. If an elderly person is atop the seat and feels her or himself begin to fade, all they need do is press the big, red EJECT button on the side of the tank. The toilet will hurl them through the doorway where they can die on their beds — and, as a bonus, a tome that signifies intelligence will drop from the ceiling onto their dead body. (The choices here include the Bible or the latest Malcolm Gladwell title.) There’s a complication, in that one’s pants might remain around one’s ankles, but at least the grandkids will not talk about nana dying “while taking a dump.” As far as scat jokes go, this one’s got some fun visuals.

Cha Cha Slide

During this wedding reception, buttoned-up dude Daniel (Mulaney) gets nervous about making a good impression in front of his girlfriend (Ego Nwodim) and her family. Though he seems very, very white, Daniel proves he knows all the extra moves to Mr C the Slide Man’s “Cha-Cha Slide,” including “stir them grits,” and “shoot them dice.” He also seems to know just about everyone in the room intimately, including his former Howard frat brother (Chris Redd) and his girlfriend’s aunt (Leslie Jones). It’s a fun idea, but between the constant oddball dance moves and Daniel’s insider information, the sketch splits its focus and never clearly paints Daniel’s dilemma.

Top to bottom, this is one of the best SNL episodes in a long time. Mulaney’s writing fuels not only the monologue, but truly excellent sketches including both “Bodega Bathroom” and “What’s That Name?” Bill Hader’s presence delivers comic precision to the latter, as well as in his role as furious Republican Jim Jordan in the cold open. McKinnon and Strong both have incredibly good nights, and the character feature of Update is fantastic. And, of course, “Bodega Bathroom” lives up to the high standard set by last year’s “Lobster Diner.” This one will be hard to top, but Idris Elba will give it a shot next Saturday.

There was no sophomore slump for John Mulaney in his second shot at hosting Saturday Night Live in less than a year.

Mulaney, a former SNL writer, had a high bar to scale given that his last outing included the brilliant “Diner Lobster” sketch but, with help from friend Bill Hader and a very game cast, the episode included several slam dunk sketches and less filler than usual.

Cold Open

As expected the show kicked off with the C-Span coverage of the Congressional Oversight Committee Hearings of Michael Cohen, once again played by Ben Stiller. Kenan Thompson as Rep. Elijah Cummings brought the proceedings to order asking people not to “ooh and aah” since “this is not ‘Married… with Children.’” He teases a “performance” later by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villasenor still being underutilized for a personality that seems an obvious choice for more screen time). Stiller-as-Cohen notes at the top of his statement that he had some help from the guys who wrote the Oscar-winning Green Book. The sketch is fine with a coterie of the cast running through solid impressions of the major players with surprise guest Hader relishing his role as agitated Rep. Jim Jordan. The best bits here involve Stiller randomly reciting lyrics from Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn” as part of his statement and lines like “In conclusion, I know that I was wrong and I know it because I got caught.” (The true bummer of the whole show is the appearance of Hader prompting hopes that Stefon– whom he co-created with Mulaney— might show up on “Weekend Update.” He did not. Maybe he was busy at New York’s hottest club, Spicy?)

Monologue

Like most comics, Mulaney stayed in his wheelhouse with a lengthy stretch of straight stand-up. (The singing and dancing that is often seen here came later.) Topics included his parents inquiry into whether his now wife, who is Jewish, might consider converting to Catholicism. He joked about coming home with a brochure: “Hey honey, allow me to tell you about an exciting, not new, organization. Don’t Google us! You know that strange look of shame and unhappiness I have in my eyes at all times especially after sex and it was all forced on me at birth? What if you voluntarily signed up for it?”

“What’s That Name?”

Hader returns for this painfully hilarious game show in which, as vaguely sinister host Vince Blight (Hader) says, “We show you a person, you tell us their name.” The contestants Doug (Mulaney) and Courtney (Cecily Strong) have no trouble identifying famous pop culture figures like Chrissy Teigen but stumble when trying to ID their best friend’s girlfriend of four years or the wife of a partner at their advertising firm. “What kind of horrible game show is this?” asks Doug. The best kind.

“Bodega Bathroom”

While “Diner Lobster” had the benefit of surprise, “Bodega Bathroom” proves to be a sterling sequel. Charlie (Pete Davidson) and his friend (Chris Redd) are chatting with the man behind the cash register (Mulaney) when Charlie, appallingly, asks for the key to the bathroom. This sketch has everything: a visual joke of the key to the bathroom being attached to a cinder block, a talking toilet, Russian Oreos and Oompa Loompas that are actually Sour Patch Kids who have been in the bodega so long that they’ve come to life. It also has a huge swath of the cast who are clearly having a great time. The musical parodies include Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Little Shop of Horrors, Cats and Rent. (“525,000 unrelated things.”)

“Cha Cha Slide”

While we might not have time, or even want, to unpack the various elements at the root of why this sketch hit so well on so many different levels — an interracial couple Daniel and Lisa (Mulaney and Ego Nwodim) attend a wedding reception primarily attended by members of her black family that he thinks he has not met– it’s partly because being a stiff is so core to Mulaney’s shtick that watching him do the dance moves from Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” and pulling not one, but two, church fans from his back pocket, will never not be funny.

Weekend Update

In a very short version of the news, few jokes landed big laughs, more of a steady chuckle, as Colin Jost and Michael Che ran through topics including Bryce Harper signing to the Phillies, the Cohen hearings, Trump’s CPAC speech and talks with Kim Jong-un. Jost did note how many weird details came up during the Cohen proceedings like Trump allegedly inflating his net worth by $4 billion to buy the Buffalo Bills. Jost: “It’s like using a fake ID to get into a Nickelback concert.” Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant appeared as sisters Vaneta and Wylene, purveyors of meat from Smokery Farms who’s business is being ruined by vegans. The biggest laughs came when the pair and Jost began struggling to keep from breaking when they began discussing an, apparently very aromatic, basket featuring a variety of cuts of meat that came only “from animals that are individually stupid and bad” to make people more comfortable eating them.

The amiable pop country star rolled through two new tunes from his forthcoming album Center Point Road, the mid tempo ode to his wife “Look What God Gave Her” — co-written by his dad Rhett Akins– and the party jam “Don’t Threaten Me With a Good Time,” which shined a bit of light on his two female back-up vocalists.

Notable: “Shark Tank: Legal Edition”

While this sketch, actually one of the night’s shortest, wasn’t among the top three it had a few laughs and some interesting tension.

The set up, famous lawyers– Alan Dershowitz (Mulaney), Jeanine Pirro (Strong), Michael Avenatti (Davidson), Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon) and Cellino & Barnes (Alex Moffat and Kyle Mooney) — hear from celebrities in trouble to decide whether they will help them. Robert Kraft (Beck Bennett) drew the expected jokes. But when Redd entered as Empire star Jussie Smollett the audience audibly gasped. Asked why he was there, Redd-as-Smollet answered “I broke humanity.”

Avenatti was apparently watching and decided to respond to Davidson’s portrayal with a pair of jokey tweets written in the style of President Trump.

After the show Mulaney SNL posted a photo of Mulaney and Davidson wearing matching t-shirts emblazoned with Mulaney’s wife’s face.

Trump urged the man, Hayden Williams, to “sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state” over the assault, which was spurred on by signage at the Turning Point USA booth Williams was stationed at on the Berkeley Campus.

“He’s going to be a very wealthy young man,” said Trump. “Go get ’em, Hayden.”

Williams is not a student of the university, but was asked to be at the booth that day by members of the UC Berkeley chapter of Turning Point USA to attend. His suspected attacker, Zachary Greenberg, is also not a UC Berkeley student.

According to Williams, a pair of men had initially been angered by a sign referencing Jussie Smollett, and began cursing at the group. One of them, allegedly Greenberg, became physically aggressive.

Cell phone video of the assault shows Williams recording his attacker up close, before the assailant shoved Williams away, then punches Williams.

The school’s Chancellor, Carol Christ, spoke out about the attack in a message sent to the university.

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” read the message from Christ and the Vice Chancellor for student affairs Stephen C. Sutton. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

The president also announced that he will “very soon” sign an executive order requiring schools to “support free speech” as a requirement to receive research money from the government.

“If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden to speak,” said Trump.

It is unclear how such a statement would enhance already existing protections under the United States Constitution, nor if such an executive order would be limited to conservative speakers.

“Hey everybody, you won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” says Chris Redd’s Smollett as the audience groans. The actor has been accused by Chicago police of staging a hate attack on himself because he was unhappy with his salary on “Empire.” When Redd is told there are surveillance cameras outside, he drops his story.

“Jussie, why exactly are you here today,” asks Davidson’s Avenatti.

“I broke humanity?” Redd’s Smollet responds. “But if you take my case, I’m offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire.’ I die.”

Pirro recuses herself because she’s just “too turned on” that a gay black man is in trouble.

Beck Bennett played the first contestant, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was recently charged with solicitation of prostitution.

“Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,” explained Bennett’s Kraft. “I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.”

Avenatti later quipped in a tweet that he would play Davidson next week.

In the skit, titled, “Legal Shark Tank,” a panel of Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), Judge Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), Alan Dershowitz (John Mulaney), and Rudy Guiliani (Kate McKinnon) sit and wait for celebrities accused of crimes to present their case.

The two celebrities mocked by SNL are Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner arrested in a prostitution sting, and Jussie Smollett.

Smollett, portrayed by Chris Redd, says, “You won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself!”

“Jussie, is that true?” Dershowitz asked.

“Are there cameras outside?” Smollett said.

“Yes” Dershowitz responded.

“Then, no it is not,” Smollett said.

Smollett also said that he was there because he “broke humanity” and would give whoever took his case spoilers about him dying in Empire.

SNL also took the opportunity to mock Jeanine Pirro for being “turned on” by the idea of a gay black man faking a hate crime.

Indeed, Chicago police believe that Smollett paid two men to attack him in January. The 36-year-old originally claimed that he was violently attacked by two Trump supporters who wrapped a rope around his neck, poured a chemical on him, and yelled “This is MAGA country!”"

One of the sharpest episodes of the season, the cast laid into Michael Cohen, R. Kelly and Jussie Smollett, while also reminding us that we're all kind of horrible, too.

John Mulaney was an odd choice to host ""Saturday Night Live"" when he did so late last season, but he proved himself absolutely brilliant in this format.

It's no wonder they brought him back within the year, because he brings a level of energy and creativity and reckless abandon so strong that even this week's weakest sketch was very entertaining. And it's best is an instant classic.

Mulaney wasn't the only new face, either, as Ben Stiller made his inevitable return as Michael Cohen so ""SNL"" could poke fun at his recent hearing, while Bill Hader returned to the house that made him to appear in two brilliant sketches. And he was on fire!

As usual, we're ranking all the sketches from worst to first, including the Cold Open and the regular ""Weekend Update"" segments. We'll skip the musical guests, because they're not usually funny - unless Ashlee Simpson shows up. We wrap up with a look at the cast-member who had the strongest week.

Shark Tank: Legal Edition

Pete Davidson debuted his Michael Avenatti, joined by Cecily Strong's Jeanine Pirro, John Mulaney's Alan Dershowitz and Kate McKinnon's Rudy Giuliani in a sketch where troubled famous people sought their legal help. Potential clients included Robert Kraft (Beck Bennett) and Jussie Smollett (Chris Redd). Unfortunately, they only dabbled in the shallow end on both stories when they could have really taken a deep dive and really dug into the meat of these stories. Still, it was fun watching Kate, Pet and Cecily really ham it up in their respective roles.

Cha Cha Slide

There were two elements of humor here. One was that John Mulaney was at a reception with Ego Nwodim's family and yet he seemed to know more of them than she did. He was more immersed in the traditionally black community, including church and Howard University, than even his girlfriend realized. And then the other layer was the bizarre new-rules version of the ""Cha Cha Slide"" Kenan Thompson was emceeing, including two different Beyonce moves, stirring grits and the use of a church fun. Both were gently humorous, neither was hilarious.

MONOLOGUE - John Mulaney

Once again, as he did last April, John Mulaney gave a standup routine in lieu of a monologue, but it was to be expected. Plus, it was still funny as he played off of his look and talked about how he used to be cooler, like when he did cocaine. He dug into his own Catholic history, subways and the weirdness of life in NYC. While there were no laugh-out-loud moments, there was plenty of good content delivered with confidence and charm, setting the stage well for the show to come.

CUT FOR TIME - Dianne Feinstein

In this pre-recorded sketch that was cut for time, Cecily Strong's Sen. Dianne Feinstein proved just how horrible she is with kids, with having an open mind and with listening. She was combative and angry, lashing out at teachers and students and constantly demanding a D.O. (do-over). This was to help her public image, but even she couldn't escape the unpleasant reality of her closed-minded reactions.

Toilet Death Ejector

The aim issues with this self-explanatory invention were the funniest bit in a totally absurd and yet well-intentioned fake ad. Nobody wants to die on the toilet, elderly or not, but there are a lot of kinks and details to work out before this one is really ready for market. And yes, it's the most obvious questions you're thinking of, but it was still funny. We're still laughing at the dead bodies flying across the room and just missing the bed.

Weekend Update

Just like in the cold open, Michael Cohen's testimony was the top story, with Colin Jost kicking it off by comparing him to that fat sewer rat that got stuck in a grate. They moved through some of Cohen's weirder claims and on to Trump's weird CPAC appearance where he hugged a flag and is probably still talking.

In response to a pig that paints and thus was spared the slaughterhouse, Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant dropped by as two women from a farm that would never slaughter and serve a cute or talented animal; only the stupid and bad ones for them. But the funniest part of the whole bit wasn't the details about the animals on a meat tray they brought out, but how much the stench of the meat nearly derailed the bit over and over again.

""For R. Kelly, unpaid child support is also alimony,"" Michael Che said once they jumped back into the news, proving they were not going to hold back on this story. And then they slid backwards into an equally scathing -- okay, maybe not equally -- dig at Jussie Smollett. And that was it, a shorter and tighter ""Update"" than usual, but nevertheless continuing the hot streak of the segment.

The Unknown Caller

Pete Davidson brought back his most famous character, the clueless and could-care-less-about-anything Chad to drop him into a starring role in a movie. ""Okay."" This character is so stupid, and yet in this ""Scream""-inspired setting it worked perfectly. John Mulaney tried so hard to menace him, but Chad just wasn't capable of getting it, but hey, free pizza!

To Have and Have Not

In this pastiche of classic movies, Kate McKinnon tried to play the seductress, but as she couldn't whistle or sing or do any of the things her ""sexy"" monologue was demanding it just got increasingly awkward and embarrassing for both her and her would-be man, John Mulaney. Kate got a reaction when she suggested maybe she was gay and that's why she was so bad at this. John played it very lowkey, which worked perfectly as Kate went deeper into the bizarre.

COLD OPEN - Michael Cohen Hearing

Ben Stiller came back with his Michael Cohen impression, surprised at the lack of surprise when he claimed Trump was a racist, conman and cheat. ""For too many years I was loyal to a man when I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""Now I know how Khloe Kardashian feels."" Yes, this joke got the biggest audience response ... welcome to America. At least until Bill Hader's angry Jim Jordan took over. He was a tour de force of fake fury and it only made us miss him on this show even more!

What's That Name?

Bill Hader returned to host the fake game show where people are asked to identify regular people in their lives (which they can't do) and people like the Kardashians (which they can) ... welcome to America. As expected, John had no trouble with Chrissy Teigen, but the name of his good friend's girlfriend of four years? Well, who has the time? Who can pay attention to such things? We're all so busy these days. It was the deepest exploration of the shallowness and self-centeredness of modern Americans and it was brilliantly played by all involved.

Bodega Bathroom

An instant classic in gross-out humor. John Mulaney and Kenan Thompson presented a musical based on the mythical and disgusting bodega bathroom, complete with backup singing cockroaches (Melissa Villasenor and Cecily Strong) and an oversized singing toilet (Beck Bennett). It was a mashup of several musicals with the toilet acting appropriately as Audrey II from ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" and it was a masterpiece of parody. And if you're not from an area with bodegas, just change it to those creepy off-brand gas station (in)convenience stores) and you get the idea. They're gross, they're weird and now they have a beautiful tribute to their very awfulness.

PLAYER OF THE WEEK

It's interesting that two of the week's strongest sketches were carried on the back of former cast-member Bill Hader, who had an absolutely brilliant night. But he's not eligible, which leaves us looking at Cecily Strong and Kate McKinnon, with Pete Davidson a surprise dark horse.

But it was the two veteran ladies who had the most fun, and especially if we include Cecily's cut Feinstein performance. On top of that, she killed it again as Jeanine Pirro and provided able support as a dancing cockroach and a game show contestant.

But we have to give it to the brilliant Kate McKinnon, who delighted us again with her Rudy Giuliani, laughed it up in ""Update,"" brought the Virgin Mary candle to life in the bodega and then brought it home as a classic film star who has no idea how to be alluring.

It's moments like this that remind us just how much of a treasure she is to this show, emerging as the female cast leader (we have to give Kenan his props as overall leader) and one of the most versatile and fearless performers on the show. There will be a huge hole in the cast should she decide to leave after this season, or whenever she decides to go.

""Saturday Night Live"" airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m .ET on NBC.

SNL host John Mulaney was cast as Alan Dershowitz; Pete Davidson appeared as porn star Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti; Cecily Strong played Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro; and Kate McKinnon reprised her impression of Rudy Giuliani.

“I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” the faux Smollett told the four lawyers in a parody of the Empire actor’s claim he was the victim of a hate crime on the streets of Chicago.

When informed that there are cameras outside the studio that could prove his attack wasn’t real, he recants.

In the sketch, Dershowitz tells Smollett, “Jussie, you have everything I love in a client. You are famous and probably guilty. End of list.”

Taking on Kraft’s scandal of allegedly soliciting sex at a Florida day-spa, Bennett’s Kraft told the lawyers he was the only person to ever take a private jet to get $59 sex act.

“Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,” he tells the lawyers."

Sure is nice to have common sense prevail in Washington, isn’t it? Representative Sten Hoyer (MD) says the Democrats’ new gun control proposal is quite useless for reducing violence, but he supports it anyway, because it is better to do something (something dumb?) rather than nothing! The bill requires background checks even if a parent wills a shotgun to a son or daughter – always a big source of firearms for criminals, right?

The Daily Caller has a short video called, “The Conservative Bartender” at its site. In the skit, the customer asks for an “AOC Cocktail” (referring to numbskull Democrat-socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The bartender tells him to step in line and that he should be served in about three hours – illustrating the typical experiences of people in socialist countries who daily deal with rationing and long queues. See at: https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/21/conservative-bartender-aoc-cocktails/

Ah, the stupidity and ignorance of youthful Democrat zealots: a statue of William C. Lee , a World War II hero, was vandalized in Dunn, North Carolina. Though garbed in a WWII uniform, the idiots still could not tell the difference between him and the Virginia Civil War hero, Robert E. Lee, presumed by a local spokesman to have been the intended target. Not to be outdone, AOC was recently photographed in a restaurant with one of her staff employees, rumored to be a boyfriend. The latter was enjoying a huge burger in the presence of She Who Tells us to Eat Less Beef to Save the Planet.

Just harmless eccentrics, those LGBTQ activists, right? On top of the Jussie Smollett fraud in Chicago, police in Jackson, Michigan have charged “Nikki Joly,” a man who says he is a woman, with burning down his (her?) own house, five pets included, while attempting to stage another fake “hate crime.” Joly thinks that the LGBTQ movement isn’t getting enough attention and wants more uproar over the cause! Do you suppose the animal rights folks will take issue with the cruel deaths of Joly’s dogs and cats?

Another video available on pjmedia captures a moment of violence on the campus at UC Berkeley, an institution infamous for harboring left-wing extremism. A conservative student had set up a table to recruit for “Turning Point USA” and was physically attacked and beaten by a foul mouthed thug, leaving the victim with minor injuries. Another thug overturned the table. All that was missing from these attackers was the brown khaki, jack-booted uniforms. And they call the right the “fascists?” See here: https://pjmedia.com/trending/leftist-thug-caught-on-video-assaulting-conservative-berkeley-student-while-fellow-students-laugh/

And, to make you feel good about the integrity of our election systems: after Texas found substantial evidence that up to 100,000 aliens were voting illegally in the state, a Federal judge has stepped in and blocked their removal from the rolls by state officials. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court shot down an attempt by the notoriously radical Federal 9th Court of Appeals to use the vote of Justice Stephen Reinhardt, dead for 11 days before the decision was rendered, to claim a liberal 6-5 majority ruling on a pay equity case! Yes, sir, let no vote go uncounted, say the Democrats!

The sketch, modeled after the entrepreneurial reality series Shark Tank, pits Pete Davidson’s Michael Avenatti, John Mulaney’s Alan Dershowitz, Cecily Strong’s Jeanine Pirro and Kate McKinnon’s Rudy Giuliani (and “jingle-based attorneys” Cellino & Barnes) against one another in an effort to recruit the high-profile clients.

“If you pick me, I will happily go on TV, contradict everything you’ve ever said and then add some additional damaging information free of charge,” McKinnon’s Giuliani promised Kraft after the New England Patriots owner was busted on solicitation charges.

Next, Chris Redd’s Jussie Smollett burst into the studio yelling, “Hey everyone, you won’t believe this but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself.” He then admitted that he was lying.

Campus police arrested a man suspected of attacking conservative activist Hayden Williams on the University of California Berkeley campus last month, according to new reports.

On Friday, March 1, campus police booked Zachary Greenberg, 28, into jail after he was believed to be the man who was caught on camera punching the conservative activist at the university campus on Feb. 19.

Greenberg allegedly hit Williams multiple times, including directly in the face, according to the video.

“UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges,” the UC Berkeley Public Affairs team announced in a campus statement.

“Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision,” the statement concluded.

Greenberg is being held on a $30,000 bail, according to local media.

Following Greenberg’s arrest, Charlie Kirk, founder and president of TPUSA, issued a statement, calling the evidence in the case “incontrovertible.”

“Today, we have finally learned the identity of the attacker and that the violent man has been arrested,” his statement read. “While every America should be afforded their due process, we believe that the video evidence in this case is incontrovertible.”

“We hope 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg is prosecuted to the full extent of the law for assault with a deadly weapon, which should be considered an act of hate,” he continued. “Hopefully, this dark chapter will act as a wake up call to those concerned about actual politically motivated hate crimes in America. Berkeley and all college campuses across American should be safe havens for free thought and opinions—especially for a targeted conservative minority.”

The Violent Incident

The activist, Hayden Williams, was manning a table recruiting for Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative student organization operating on 1,400 campuses.

The display had signs reading, “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and “This is MAGA Country”—a reference to the case of Jussie Smollett, a TV actor charged with staging a racially motivated attack on himself. Smollett had tried to frame supporters of President Donald Trump by claiming the attackers referenced Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Williams was then approached by critics and began to record the encounter.

“I’m just going to video it for my own safety, because you seem really erratic,” he told one person who accused him of “encouraging violence.” His actions only angered the pair more and he was attacked moments later, reported the Washington Enquirer.

The video of the incident was posted on Twitter by Charlie Kirk, president of TPUSA, and had over 2 million views by March 1.

This is the violent left! RT! pic.twitter.com/7RjbCPUcDf — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 21, 2019

“Imagine if the attacker was wearing MAGA hat, would be national news!” Kirk wrote in the tweet. “This is the violent left!”

In response to the incident, the university expressed “unwavering” commitment to “freedom of expression and perspective.”

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Chancellor Carol Christ said in a message to the campus community. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here.”

Williams is a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, a training organization for conservative activists.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case,” campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof said. “He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view.”

“There’s a certain culture there that is especially hostile on Berkeley’s campus and across the country to conservative students,”Williams said in an interview with Fox Business Network. “They’re willing to use violence if they think you’re being too controversial.”"

John Mulaney hosted “Saturday Night Live” for the first time less than a year ago, immediately surpassing every other host’s contributions that season with weird but memorable sketches like “Sitcom Reboot” and “Diner Lobster.” This week, in his second time around as host, he does the same thing.

Host: John Mulaney

John Mulaney is an interesting “Saturday Night Live” host, because he comes in with all the goodwill of a long-time cast member, even though he was “only” a writer who had a few appearances on Weekend Update. (The reminder that Mulaney was never actually a cast member always just kind of sneaks up on you, doesn’t it?) So even though this is only his second time hosting, his performance in this role, of course, comes with the expectation that he’ll have more creative freedom than any other celebrity host. And he delivers on that expectation, far past the obvious stand-up monologue to open the show.

Mulaney’s role as host also allows for a surprise return from beloved “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Bill Hader, who makes a “WOO!”-worthy appearance in the Michael Cohen testimony cold open — a cold open which is honestly the funniest political cold open in a long time on this show, even though it’s still not hilarious and it’s still very long — and an absolutely brilliant appearance in the first sketch of the night.

Best Sketches of The Night: “What’s That Name” & “Bodega Bathroom”

Now, speaking of the first sketch of the night… The thing about John Mulaney sketches is how they’re simultaneously so bizarre and hyper-focused. That truly defines all but one sketch tonight, but “What’s That Name” is pretty much the definitive sketch in this case. What looks like a standard game show sketch on a show that could honestly stand to ease up on the game show sketches ends up being something so much more layered. It’s even clear to tell from the live audience reactions that there’s no real expectation as to where the sketch will go at the very beginning when it seems the biggest joke is just the fact that they’re answering the questions in this game for five whole dollars. Things seem like they all fall into place with the initial introduction of Mulaney’s friend and his friend’s girlfriend of four years, but the sketch still finds ways to go all over the place after that.

Hader’s character’s open contempt for Mulaney’s character — and the basic concept that Mulaney’s character is really terrible when it comes to even thinking about women as people, without being an outward villain about it — is truly what guides this sketch though, and the final reveal that this game show exists just because he wants “chaos” is so perfectly specific.

There’s no doubt about it: This sketch is 100 percent the sequel to “Diner Lobster,” because when you’re able to make something like “Diner Lobster” a hit, you’re going to want to try to capture lightning in a bottle the second time around. And despite how niche and specific these sketches are, it is easy (well, ”easy”) to repeat that sort of specialness, because the actual set-up for the sketches is actually a lot simpler than one would expect — it simply takes the premise of something any rational person wouldn’t do (order lobster at a diner, ask to use a bathroom at a bodega, or really a convenience store in general unless it was an emergency) and turns it into a musical theater epic.

This time around, instead of just going with the “Les Miserable” thread, “Bodega Bathroom” expands its reach with song parody choices and references from a range of productions like “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” (the main source), “Cats,” “Little Shop of Horrors,” and even “Rent.”

Worst Sketch of The Night: “Legal Shark Tank”

This is the only sketch of the night resembling anything close to a “dud.” This sketch clearly only exists to get to the Jussie Smollett punchline, with the majority of the sketch being dedicated solely to the introduction of the legal Sharks than the actual bit.

Worst Impression: Chris Redd as Jussie Smollett (“Legal Shark Tank”)

This isn’t exactly an impression heavy episode, with the “Legal Shark Tank” sketch really being the only one outside of the cold open to choose from here. Neither of those has great impressions, unfortunately.

In fact, Cecily Strong honestly seems to be the only one during this particular sketch to get the memo on doing much of anything. While “Saturday Night Live” was able to fill the “Cha Cha Slide” sketch with black extras, this sketch serves as a reminder that it can’t do that all the time. Chris Redd is Jussie Smollett not because of anything resembling a good Jussie Smollett impression or take on the real person but because he’s the only cast member it could be; it wouldn’t be Kenan Thompson or Michael Che, and Che also doesn’t even feature in sketches enough to be considered an option.

Best Male Performer: Bill Hader

Not to throw the current contracted “Saturday Night Live” players under the bus, but Bill Hader’s work in just one sketch — the “What’s That Name” sketch — is so much on a higher level than literally anything else in this episode or even season that it makes one want to reevaluate every glowing review of anyone’s performance and ask, “Yes, but was it Hader-level good?” Sorry, everyone.

Best Female Performer: Kate McKinnon

Cecily Strong definitely puts in a lot of work in this episode, but Kate McKinnon just squeezes ahead of her in the “Best Female Performer” of the night role with her role as the very awkward Lauren Bacall in the Cinema Classic sketch at the end of the night. (Speaking of that sketch, it’s been a while since an iteration of that sketch has been on “Saturday Night Live,” and it’s always great to see Kenan’s Reece De’What.)

She also gets to introduce a new character alongside Aidy Bryant during Weekend Update — which is always a treat, to break the monotony — and break over the smell of a lot of raw meat. It honestly plays much better than it sounds.

Final Thoughts

Talk about an episode that makes narrowing something down the best sketch (or even sketches) a true job of work. This is an episode of “Saturday Night Live” with a very high sketch hit rate, with only one truly less than “good” sketch to even think of when it comes to the “Worst Sketch of the Night.” And the key to all of those successful sketches is that they don’t just go with the easy joke: Mulaney’s character in “Cha Cha Slide” isn’t worried about not fitting in because of race reasons, the “Toilet Death Projector” turns the obvious ridiculousness of the idea into unexpected body horror, and the “Chad Horror Movie” (aka “The Unknown Caller,” a “Scream” riff in 2019 which still works because “Scream” is always relevant) takes the pretty simple Chad bit and gives it new life by stretching the dimwitted character’s existence past just being a sex idiot for female hosts to strangely seduce. One could only imagine what would happen if John Mulaney got his hands on Cecily’s Gemma character.

At this point, Mulaney’s strength as a host is not so much an indictment of the hosting caliber of other celebrities as it is proof of a major criticism of these most recent seasons: When the series actually allows its hosts to show and highlight their comedic voices, instead of just playing it safe so everyone gets through the episode alive, it’s hard to touch “Saturday Night Live.”

Then again, Mulaney is the rare celebrity host that wrote for the series in the first place and has more than enough proof of his comedic sensibilities to allow him that room to just do whatever the heck he wants. And this episode thrives because of that.

But several people did over the last week, in some eye-opening ways.

The most uncomfortable instance involved a U-T editorial cartoon, depicting Jussie Smollett alongside James Baldwin and Toni Morrison – an offensive comparison that the paper pulled, and apologized for. The paper itself hosted a conversation about the decision-making behind the cartoon and the conversations it provoked, and the cartoonist, Steve Breen, even talked with other newsrooms about the episode.

To be clear, it sucks that this happened. But so often in San Diego politics, I’ve watched leaders clam up and refuse to admit any wrongdoing, even long after it’s become clear that something bad happened. Breen and the U-T’s willingness to say plainly that the cartoon shouldn’t have run was satisfying in that sense.

The U-T editorial board, meanwhile, was on the other end of some fiery truth-telling from someone we’ve come to expect it from: Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, when asked about the San Diego Unified’s insanely high 2016 graduation rate – an achievement we spent more than a year unraveling – was pure fire, and she made several references to our reporting in criticizing the number:

This is not true. Now, if you decide you’re not going to count over half of them you might end with 97 percent or you took a group of them and put them into a computer class and had them finish… you know. You… and then you’re going to tell me this is a great program. Why? You… these kids can do all of their work that they have failed for two years or three years… you can do it all in one big swoop of a semester and they’re going to master this material every month, a different subject matter? Come on now, you know. You’d have to… I mean I… I don’t know. I guess you believe in unicorns.

That brings us to another member of the Assembly known for speaking her truth: Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, as Scott and Andy reported this week, told visiting members of the local Chamber of Commerce she’s not interested in having meetings in which they all smile and pretend to get along, only to have the Chamber torch her legislation or worse: “Let’s be honest and not play a game where we all get together and break bread and smile and then talk shit in our silos,” she said. “Have the ovaries to stand up and have a tough conversation, because when we create a conflict that can be resolved, it can be resolved in a good way.”

When I read this, I pictured Gonzalez dropping the mic as Ariana Grande’s “Fake Smile” blared throughout the room, as if from nowhere.

Finally, SANDAG’s new director continues to say plainly what we’ve been reporting for more than two years.

Most recently, he admitted that SANDAG can’t make good on everything it promised to voters with TransNet – a fraud you should really sit with for a moment.

And while it’s a relief to have the agency helmed by someone willing to speak hard truths, it would have been nice to hear those truths from Gary Gallegos and Ron Roberts at any point in 2016, 2017 or 2018 – when they were just as clear as they are now. It’d be similarly nice if anyone from San Diego Unified were willing to be as frank about what it took to achieve that graduation rate as Weber is.

What VOSD Learned This Week

A bill written by Sen. Ben Hueso and sponsored by City Attorney Mara Elliott would make it harder for members of the public to sue over violations of the California Public Records Act. A fact sheet released by Hueso’s office says it’s trying to help overburdened public agencies, but transparency advocates say the bill would let government officials cover up wrongdoing.

♦ ♦ ♦

The city did a big thing this week! It, along with the county and a couple other local cities, voted to move forward in creating a government-run energy company. But there are still some fights to come – namely, whether the agency will require labor-friendly contracts.

These government-run power companies are called community choice aggregators. But what, exactly, does the “choice” part mean?

We talked about CCAs, and how they factor into the so-called San Diego Green New Deal, on the podcast.

♦ ♦ ♦

We hear a lot about immigration enforcement when it comes to people trying to cross the border, or people arrested at their homes, at their children’s schools or just walking down the street. We hear far less often about the enforcement the government does of workplaces – but that enforcement is ramping up in a massive way.

And speaking of workplace issues, the confrontation between Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez and exotic dancers who oppose a worker classification bill she’s pursuing was far from the first time strippers have stolen the spotlight in local political affairs.

Have you ever noticed how differently Republicans are treated in the media than Democrats?

Every newsroom in the country used to have what was called the “AP Stylebook” to use in writing news stories.

Now you need two AP stylebooks, one for Democrats, about whom seldom is heard a discouraging word, and a second for the GOP, with a hundred different pejoratives.

Two parties, two vocabularies. One positive, one negative — very bad, evil in fact.

Consider the testimony by Michael Cohen last week in front of various Congressional committees.

For example, since he worked for Donald Trump, Cohen was described about a million times as a “fixer.” Democrats, on the other hand, have lawyers.

To prevent the release of embarrassing information, Democrats’ lawyers negotiate NDA’s — nondisclosure agreements. Republican fixers’ NDAs are “hush money,” or “bribes.”

Hillary Clinton paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrat operatives who then bought or made up false Russian dirt on Trump — that was opposition research. Republicans, on the other hand, “collude!”

Republicans lie, Democrats misspeak.

Democrats plan, Republicans scheme.

Republicans hire lobbyists, Democrats use advocates. Republicans employ operatives or hired guns, Democrats prefer community activists.

If a Democrat changes his or her position on an issue, they have evolved … grown. Republicans “flip-flop.”

Whenever an unfamiliar politician is ensnared in some scandal, you naturally wonder which party he or she is a member of. If the “embattled” pol is a Republican, affiliation is usually noted in the headline, or at the very latest in the first paragraph.

If, however, you reach the third paragraph of the story without his party being identified, you can be absolutely certain you are reading about a Democrat miscreant.

Likewise, accusers are handled differently depending on who exactly they’re accusing. Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was almost derailed by the not particularly credible “Dr.” Christine Blasey Ford. One of the women who’s accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Virginia of sexual assault likewise has a Ph.D., but how often does the alt-left media refer to “Dr. Vanessa Tyson.” Fairfax, you see, is a Democrat.

Was Jussie Smollett’s fake hate crime ever referred to as “alleged?” Of course not. But all the real, documented, videotaped attacks on conservatives — invariably they are alleged, or “according to police reports.”"

The sketch put a twist on “Shark Tank” by swapping out the famous investors for infamous defence attorneys while celebrities with legal troubles came out to make a case for why they need high-powered legal representation.

The panel consisted of high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), Fox news commentator Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), former O.J. Simpson defence attorney Alan Dershowitz (host John Mulaney) and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon).

They first heard from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft (Beck Bennett) — who was recently charged with misdemeanour solicitation of prostitution — before Smollett (Chris Redd) walked onto the stage, looking for help.

“I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” Smollett declared.”

“Is that true?” Dershowitz asked.

“Are there cameras outside?” Smollett asked. “Then no.”

To sweeten the deal, Smollett also offered the lawyers an incentive to represent him.

“If you take my case, I’m offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire’: I die,” Smollett explained.

“You have everything I love in a client,” Dershowitz said. “You’re famous, you’re probably guilty, end of list.”

The sketch comes just over a week after Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.

Smollett has staunchly maintained his innocence in regards to the charges and denies involvement in orchestrating the alleged attack. For more on the legal drama, check out the video below.

Smollett has maintained that he is a victim and has denied all the allegations that he staged the incident via his attorney last week. However, Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ET. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

The actor was then released after he posted $10,000 of his $100,000 bond. Since then, executive producers of Empire have released a statement explaining that they would be removing Smollett's role from the last two episodes of this season of the Fox drama.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" the statement reads. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement adds.

Smollett's next hearing is set for March 14. For more on the scandal, watch below.

Ben Stiller reprised his role as Michael Cohen for the Mar. 2 episode of ” Saturday Night Live ,” in which the late-night NBC sketch comedy series addressed the Congressional hearings of Donald Trump’s former lawyer. Former “SNL” player Bill Hader also dropped by to play Ohio’s representative, Jim Jordan.

“For any other president, this hearing would be the most damning and humiliating moment of their lives. But for Trump it’s just Wednesday,” said Elijah Cummings, as played by Kenan Thompson , leading into the hearings.

Stiller as Cohen said that “if it pleases the court” he would like to read a prepared statement he wrote, to which Thompson as Cummings reminded him this was not a court.

“I had some help from the guys who wrote ‘Green Book,'” Stiller as Cohen said to begin. “Thank you for inviting me here today to correct the record under oath. Of course, the first time I testified was also under oath, but this time I, like, really mean it.”

He went on to say that “Mr. Trump is a racist…but he’s also a con man and a cheat.” To prove his statements, Stiller as Cohen brought with him a copy of a check at Trump allegedly wrote to him for repayment of “hush money” to Stormy Daniels, as well as a “threatening letter” he sent to Trump’s high school “warning them not to release his SAT scores.” The latter was just a hand turkey drawn on legal stationary with a speech bubble that said “I’ll f—ing kill you.”

Stiller as Cohen admitted “for too many years I was loyal to a man when I should not have been,” saying “now I know how Khloe Kardashian feels.”

When Thompson as Cummings opened the floor for questions, Hader as Jordan was first up, calling Cohen a “lying piece of trash” and saying he was “so angry I couldn’t even wear a jacket today.”

Threatening to “pop off,” Hader as Jordan pointed out that Cohen has been working in “some of the sleazier circles for years” and asked “what other criminals and low lifes” he worked for. “I was the deputy finance chairman for the republican party,” Stiller as Cohen responded.

This was news to Hader as Jordan, who yielded the floor, only to have it returned to him so he “could continue digging his own grave,” as Heidi Gardner as Representative Jackie Speier put it.

“Mr. Cohen, why are we suddenly supposed to believe you now? You lied about Trump being a good guy; you lied about Trump not doing any crimes; you lied about — damn it, I’m doing it again!” Hader as Jordan said.

Also, Thompson as Cummings noted that he was “told I should tease this because it’s all anyone cares about anymore: Coming up a performance by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” Ocasio-Cortez, this season, is played by Melissa Villasenor.

When asked if he had any final words, Stiller as Cohen admitted that “maybe I am not a good person — maybe I’m a liar, maybe I’m a fool, maybe I ruined hundreds of people’s lives.” There was no “but” coming, that was all he had to say.

Kraft, busted this week for soliciting a prostitute at a day spa, was offered this advice.

""Jussie, is that true?"" said Dershowitz, who was played by John Mulaney.

""Are there cameras outside?"" Smollett replied. ""Then no, it is not.""

Smollett told the attorneys he was in search of lawyers because he ""broke humanity,"" and he'd offer a spoiler that his character dies on the next season of ""Empire"" if they took his case.

Smollett surrendered to authorities earlier this month after he was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Smollett, who is black and gay, had told Chicago police last month that two men beat him, tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. He said one of his attackers shouted ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

Police said in a press conference that the ""Empire"" actor staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary."""

The star of Empire was charged with filing a false police report in the bizarre case, which originally brought Smollett sympathy from fans and supporters. But his story ultimately fell apart under scrutiny. After combing through dozens of hours of surveillance footage from the area where Smollett claimed the incident took place, police could find no evidence of any such attack.

SNL regular Chris Redd took on the role of Smollett in the sketch, which was designed as a parody of Shark Tank, called Shark Tank: Legal Edition. The four “sharks” waiting for Redd’s Smollett included Kate McKinnon’s unhinged portrayal of Rudy Giuliani and show host John Mulaney as Alan Dershowitz.

“You won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,” Redd says as Smollett.

When the panelists question him on the veracity of the claim, “Smollett” asks if there are cameras outside, and he immediately retracts his story. The panelists then go on to ask him why is there.

“Because I broke humanity?” he replies. “But if you take my case I’m offering spoilers for the next season of Empire. I die.”

The show also took a swipe at Dershowitz, who, as a celebrity lawyer, has defended the likes of Patty Hearst, Mike Tyson, and Jim Bakker, and who won on appeal in the Claus von Bülow trial, who was accused in the murder of his wife, Sunny von Bülow. Dershowitz also was a member of O.J. Simpson’s legal “dream team,” and recently, has gone to the mats defending President Donald Trump on more than one occasion.

In character as Dershowitz, Mulraney tells Redd’s Smollett that he is all that he could hope for in a client.

“Jussie, you have everything I love in a client,” Mulaney says as Dershowitz. “You are famous and probably guilty. End of list.”

Another of the show’s “sharks,” Fox News‘ Jeanine Pirro — as played by Cecily Strong — can barely contain her excitement over Smollett’s downfall.

“Oh wow!” she exclaims. “A gay black man lied about an attack! I’ve written Fox News fan-fiction about this. But I never thought it would come true!”

Even after the sketch was over, the show wasn’t finished ragging on Smollett. During the “Weekend Update” news segment, Colin Jost did a piece on a man who had been arrested for faking his own abduction in order to get out of paying a $50,000 Superbowl bet.

“Worse, he lost his job on Empire,” Jost said.

Chicago police have alleged that Smollett’s fake attack was staged because the actor was dissatisfied with his Empire salary."

Fox News ""banshee"" Jeanine Pirro doesn't come off great in the skit, either.

Saturday Night Live skewered Jussie Smollett, the out Empire actor accused by the Chicago Police Department of faking his own hate crime.

The most recent episode, hosted by comedian John Mulvaney, featured the skit ""Shark Tank: Legal Edition,"" ""where celebrities in legal trouble make their case to see if any of our sharks will represent them."" The mostly disgraced panel of attorneys included Trump sycophants like Alan Dershowitz, Jeanine Pirro, and Rudolph Giuliani; Trump antagonist and Stormy Daniels counsel Michael Avenatti rounded out the group.

After featuring New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft -- accused of soliciting prostitution -- Jussie Smollett (played by Chris Redd) came out to gasps from the audience.

""Hey everyone, you won't believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,"" Smollett says, who admits that's not true when told there are cameras outside.

When Avenatti asks why Smollett was seeking representation he says, ""I broke humanity. But if you take my case I'm offering spoilers for the next season of Empire; I die.""

Pirro's reaction to Smollett is inspired, with the character (played by star player Cecily Strong) saying she had already written ""Fox News fan fiction"" about a gay, black man lying about an attack and was sexually aroused to see it come true (allegedly!).

Beck Bennett played the businessman who was accused of soliciting prostitutes earlier this week, receiving laughs when he walked out, while Chris Redd played the actor and musician, which elicited audible surprise and concern from the audience when they realized the show would be taking on the headline-grabbing story about Smollett being attacked in Chicago in what appeared to be a hate crime but is now being investigated as a set up.

Both men appeared in front of the panel of sharks for help. This panel consisted of Pete Davidson as Michael Avenatti, Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, Kate McKinnon as ""the man, the myth, the leper"" Rudy Giuliani, and episode host John Mulaney as the ""scourge of Martha's Vineyard,"" Alan Dershowitz.

""After I started defending Trump, no one invited me to parties anymore,"" Mulaney as Dershowitz said. ""I wish I could go back to defending good people, like O.J.""

Alex Moffatt and Kyle Mooney also appeared as ""jingle based attorneys"" Cellino and Barnes.

""Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,"" Bennett as Kraft said. I'm also the only person to ever take a private jet straight to a $59 hand job. I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.""

While Davidson as Avenatti made ""beat it"" jokes, Strong as Pirro commented on the ""real criminal"" being the ""immigrant woman that stole that job from a soft, white, American hand."" Meanwhile, McKinnon as Giuliani made a plea to be selected as the counsel, saying he would ""happily go on TV, contradict everything you've ever said and then add some additional damaging information free of charge.""

When it came time for Redd as Smollett to address the panel, he said, ""Hey everyone you won't believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself.""

When he was asked if it was true, he asked if there were cameras outside, and upon hearing that there were, he rescinded his statement. When asked why he was here, he said, ""I broke humanity? But if you take my case, I am offering spoilers for the next season of 'Empire.' I die.""

Strong as Pirro said she ""wrote Fox News fan fiction"" about ""a gay, black man lying about being attacked"" -- but she admitted she never thought it would come true. She recused herself because she was ""just too turned on.""

Mulaney as Dershowitz told Redd as Smollett that he had everything he wanted in a client; he was ""famous and probably guilty."" On the other hand, though, the Cellino and Barnes jingle was reworded to say even they ""won't touch this."""

Of all the guest stars the show has tapped to play Trump’s cohorts and/or enemies, Stiller is the most consistently funny. Playing up the disgraced lawyer’s flop-sweat squirliness, he’s actually managed to craft a real character, which is more than can be said of Robert DeNiro’s dull Robert Mueller or even Alec Balwdin’s hammy Trump. Stiller is able to present Cohen as a hapless, almost sympathetic sap, while never letting you forget he’s also a fool and a liar who’s “ruined hundreds of people’s lives”.

Great as Stiller is, though, the sketch is stolen by Bill Hader, who lampoons angry Trump cheerleader Jim Jordan.

Former SNL writer turned standup megastar John Mulaney hosts for the second time. For his monologue, he delivers a mini-routine. Topics include being raised in the Catholic Church (“don’t Google us”), old-fashioned police sirens that sound “like an old, gay cat was dying”, and an awkward run-in with Woody Allen while taking his dog Petunia out for a stroll … in a literal stroller.

Hader shows up again as host of What’s That Name, a gameshow in which contestants simply have to guess other people’s names. Contestants Doug (Mulaney) and Courtney (Cecily Strong) nail the first questions, correctly identifying celebrities Chrissie Teigen and Lil Xan, but fall short when they’re asked to name people –specifically women – from their actual lives. Hader’s sadistic needling of the contestants’ misogyny adds a deeper layer to the proceedings, as does the revelation of his true motive: “In a word … chaos.” It’s a heavy contender not only for sketch of the night, but sketch of the season.

Legal Shark Tank is a version of the reality show in which guests vie for legal representation from “porn lawyer” Michael Avenatti, “former prosecutor and current Fox News banshee” Jeanine Pirro, “scourge of Martha’s Vineyard” Alan Dershowitz and “the man, the myth, the leper”, Rudi Giuliani, as well as jingle-famous injury attorneys Celino & Barnes. Contestants include New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, fresh off his arrest on charges of of soliciting prostitution, and Empire star Jussie Smollett, who has recently “broken humanity”. It’s a funny sketch but it goes by too quickly. The Kraft and Smollet stories deserve far greater savaging.

Next up is a parody of voyeuristic horror movies like Scream and Saw. A masked killer attempts to intimidate an aloof slacker (Pete Davidson) who has zero conception of the danger he’s in. Davidson is at his best leaning into his stoner persona and Mulaney is wonderful as the unhinged slasher.

Cha Cha Slide stars Mulaney and Ego Nwodim as an interracial couple. He joins her on the dance floor at her cousin’s wedding and expresses his nervousness about meeting her family, only to reveal that he has surprisingly deep roots in the black community. It’s an impressive turn by Mulaney and Nwodim, who effortlessly deliver their lines while keeping in step with the minutes-long dance routine.

Thomas Rhett takes the stage and performs the song Look What God Gave her, then Weekend Update kicks off with Colin Jost comparing Cohen to the German rat that got stuck in a sewer grate and went viral. Michael Che is sick of Cohen’s “damsel in distress routine”. He gives the president far more credit, saying “at least Donald Trump has the decency to slowly fall apart until he’s dragged off in handcuffs, like a BOSS. I mean, that’s how I want to leave SNL”.

They make fun of Trump’s unhinged two-hour CPAC speech from earlier in the day, especially the “patriotic #MeToo moment” in which he hugged the American flag like “Lenny from Of Mice and Men”.

They welcome “meat farming sisters” Valetta and Wylene Starkley. Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant play the feisty Texan siblings and find themselves continuously cracking up. They can hardly be blamed, given that a plate of meat used as a prop has clearly gone bad (even Jost comments on the stench). It’s a doubly unhinged performance that is actually made funnier by the fourth-wall breaking.

Bodega Man is an enjoyably silly and gross parody of a number of musicals, centered around a bodega bathroom and featuring full-on renditions of tunes from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Little Shop of Horrors, Cats and Rent. Along with What’s That Name, this is the standout sketch. The entire cast (including Mulaney) shines, and the choreography, set-design and use of costumes and special effects is top notch.

A new entry in the always-enjoyable Cinema Classics (hosted by film historian and world’s worst husband Reese De’What [Keenan Thompson]) features a lost scene from To Have and Have Not. McKinnon plays Lauren Bacall, who attempts to seduce Humphrey Bogart only to find, much to her chagrin and his horror, that she can’t play sexy to save her life. Rhett then closes with Don’t Threaten Me with a Good Time.

Thanks to Mulaney’s ace hosting abilities, and Hader’s welcome return, this is the best episode of the season."

In “The Oxbow Incident,” Walter van Tilburg Clark’s classic western novel, a lynch mob sets out to find three men who rustled cattle and murdered a man. Having been plagued by a rash of rustling in the area, the mob finds three strangers asleep and are convinced they’ve found the culprits.

Unwilling to wait for a trial, the mob hang the three. Later, mob members discover that the men were innocent.

A modern-day lynch mob equally sure it knew the culprit rushed to judgment. And like those at Ox Bow, it hanged the wrong man.

Jussie Smollett, a star on the soap opera “Empire,” told Chicago police that he was attacked at 2 a.m. as he walked back to his apartment. He told police that his assailants tied a noose around his neck and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, yelling “This is MAGA country.”

Given Smollett’s celebrity status, the story hit media headlines immediately. And in wholly predictable fashion, a liberal lynch mob formed to call out the obvious suspect: President Trump.

Two Democratic presidential hopefuls, Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, independently called the attack a “modern-day lynching.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders said that “the racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”

NAACP President Derrick Johnson tweeted, “The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric.”

All these folks and dozens of others should be embarrassed. Smollett staged a phony attack with two friends and has been arrested and charged with lying to police.

The liberal media that leaped to judgment ignored the basics of crime reporting. A number of obvious discrepancies in Smollett’s story should have prompted caution and a little more digging.

Downtown Chicago is hardly MAGA country. Smollett waited over an hour before contacting police. He walked into the station with the noose still around his neck and still holding the sandwich he was bringing back to his apartment.

He refused to give police his mobile phone to corroborate his story timeline.

Those expressing outrage at the alleged attack were exhibiting what psychologists call confirmation bias. As described in Psychology Today, we “stop gathering information when evidence gathered so far confirms the views (prejudices) we would like to be true.”

That human frailty exists in all of us to some extent. But when those in positions of influence fall victim, it often impacts large numbers of people in an organization or society at large.

Politicians on both the left and right, always searching for advantage, are perennially susceptible. However Democrats are particularly vulnerable by virtue of two aspects of their ideology.

First, Democratic identity politics segregates all of us into cubbyholes based on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual identities. Democrats then appeal to various groups by calling them victims of one form of prejudice or another. Straight white male Republicans are the oppressors of choice.

Hence when an instance of white male oppression comes along — and they do — confirmation bias kicks in with liberal hand-wringing and “I told you so” statements.

For example, the Washington Post’s Eugene Scott stated, “To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a ‘great America’ does not appear to include them.”

Second, Democrats’ unflinching embrace of the #MeToo movement requires them to believe any victim without qualification and usually without bothering to fact check. Case in point: Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Those who called for restraint in the Smollett case, wanting to get all the facts, were called bigots. Tre’Vell Anderson said, “I believe Jussie Smollett. You should, too.” He denounced “malicious and unfounded rumors, criticisms, and allegations of deception lodged at … black LGBTQ+ people.”

Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of Glaad, said the actor had been “doubly victimized” by the police investigation: “Jussie’s experience is sadly not unique in today’s America and we all must lock arms to change that.”

But basic fact checking should be fundamental to reporters’ work, especially for inflammatory cases like this. Why? Because Smollett’s hoax was only one of many in recent years.

The College Fix has documented 50 similar hoaxes perpetrated by college students since 2012. Hot Air lists dozens more.

For some in one of Democrats’ identity politics cubbyholes, faking an assault seems to be the way to attract attention or make a political statement. In doing so, they feed the image of a bigoted America led by a racist president.

Our mainstream media demonstrate confirmation bias daily not only with their words but by the very stories they choose to cover. Have they learned a lesson? It’s probably too much to hope for.

The Canadian entrepreneur and community organizer spoke with Fox News host Martha MacCallum on Friday about Obama’s address to young men gathered at the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance Summit in Oakland, Calif., last week.

“What President Obama is doing is reminding young men that we believe in them and have high expectations of them. Just because they encounter unfairness in the world doesn’t mean they have to lower expectations of themselves and their own behavior,” he said on “The Story,” Friday, reacting to Obama’s remarks.

“A lot of hip-hop and rap music is built around me showing how I got more money than you, I can disrespect you and you can’t do nothing about it, I’m going to talk about you and punk you,” Obama told the hundreds of young men gathered at the event. “If you are really confident about your financial situation, you probably are not going to be wearing an 8-pound chain around your neck. If you are very confident about your sexuality, you don’t have to have 8 women around you twerking.”

“The Democratic Party, their leaders today are not creating space for that kind of conversation. It’s all about what is being done to people,” Jivani said. “And it’s about clinging on to narratives where young men of color are not the moral agents that we’re focused on. We are focused on when they are victims like in the hoax case of Jussie Smollett but not focused on situations where they are both victims and perpetrators.”

He added that Obama’s message of high expectations and that “we don’t expect to you lower yourself because of what other people think of you or do to you,” is a message that the author believes “doesn’t seem to have a home in the Democratic Party today.”

The author of “Why Young Men” also addressed Obama’s advice in an opinion piece published by Fox News last week.

My latest is up at @FoxNews where I argue Barack Obama’s very good advice to young men concerning culture, family and personal responsibility is out of place in today’s Democratic Party, and wonder if such politics make him a conservative in 2019.https://t.co/BMaSh0mdTi — Jamil Jivani (@jamiljivani) February 25, 2019

But in a New York Times op-ed following the event, attorney Derecka Purnell criticized Obama for his “scolding of black boys,” and panned his advice as “part of problematic practices” that “reflect his administration’s failure… to tackle the systemic inequality that shapes black people’s lives in America.”

Liberal Fox News contributor, Richard Fowler disagreed with Jivani’s assessment on “The Story” Friday, countering that “we do expect greatness,” while citing lack of opportunities, the failure of the education system and other problems in which “Democrats and Republicans could work together on that, then maybe, just maybe, we could have a conversation to ensure that black men can achieve at the same rate white men do.”

In his op-ed, Jivani argued that the Democratic Party “is narrowly focused on articulating an urgent need for the U.S. government to save the American people with big, sweeping actions like the Green New Deal.”

“Inconsistent with Obama’s call to action in Oakland, today’s Democratic leaders appear to define young men of color by what others – rich people, white people, privileged classes – do to us and for us,” he wrote, hoping Obama would stay on message since, in his presidential past he “rarely criticized hip-hop’s cultural influence.”

“Instead, he invited rappers to the White House and publicly befriended Jay-Z and Beyonce,” he noted

After more discussion on the topic on Fox News, Jivani concluded the segment with MacCallum by saying “we still have to be the best person we can be and we don’t need to wait for all those big picture things to change in order for that to be the way.”"

Beck Bennett played the businessman who was accused of soliciting prostitutes earlier this week, receiving laughs when he walked out, while Chris Redd played the actor and musician, which elicited audible surprise and concern from the audience when they realized the show would be taking on the headline-grabbing story about Smollett being attacked in Chicago in what appeared to be a hate crime but is now being investigated as a set up.

Both men appeared in front of the panel of sharks for help. This panel consisted of Pete Davidson as Michael Avenatti, Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, Kate McKinnon as “the man, the myth, the leper” Rudy Giuliani, and episode host John Mulaney as the “scourge of Martha’s Vineyard,” Alan Dershowitz.

“After I started defending Trump, no one invited me to parties anymore,” Mulaney as Dershowitz said. “I wish I could go back to defending good people, like O.J.”

Alex Moffatt and Kyle Mooney also appeared as “jingle based attorneys” Cellino and Barnes.

“Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,” Bennett as Kraft said. I’m also the only person to ever take a private jet straight to a $59 hand job. I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.”

While Davidson as Avenatti made “beat it” jokes, Strong as Pirro commented on the “real criminal” being the “immigrant woman that stole that job from a soft, white, American hand.” Meanwhile, McKinnon as Giuliani made a plea to be selected as the counsel, saying he would “happily go on TV, contradict everything you’ve ever said and then add some additional damaging information free of charge.”

When it came time for Redd as Smollett to address the panel, he said, “Hey everyone you won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself.”

When he was asked if it was true, he asked if there were cameras outside, and upon hearing that there were, he rescinded his statement. When asked why he was here, he said, “I broke humanity? But if you take my case, I am offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire.’ I die.”

Strong as Pirro said she “wrote Fox News fan fiction” about “a gay, black man lying about being attacked” — but she admitted she never thought it would come true. She recused herself because she was “just too turned on.”

Mulaney as Dershowitz told Redd as Smollett that he had everything he wanted in a client; he was “famous and probably guilty.” On the other hand, though, the Cellino and Barnes jingle was reworded to say even they “won’t touch this.”

“I’m not an actor, I’m a [long-delayed SNL] star!”

Mired in the middle of a disappointing season of SNL, you learn not to get your hopes up. Or at least you try to. That’s the enduring fun and frustration of being a lifelong Saturday Night Live fan—experience pulls in two ways. The promise of a can’t-miss or eccentrically promising host can buoy even the most pessimistic of us with the tantalizing promise of that bottled lightning phenomenon that, even in a down year, SNL can unexpectedly pull off at any time. And, yes, last week, I got snookered by the prospect of Don Cheadle hosting what turned out to be a largely uninspired slog of an episode. (Will I make the same mistake next week with Idris Elba hosting? Yeah. Probably.)

And then there’s Mulaney.

It’s tempting to accuse critics of overrating John Mulaney’s pair of appearances on SNL, but hear me out. Unlike other stellar stand-up comics who host the show, Mulaney’s got the added cred of being intimately familiar with not just sketch comedy, but Saturday Night Live’s own system of sketch comedy from his years writing on the show. And whatever jitters he (and we) might have had about the professionally unassuming Mulaney hosting were demolished by his first appearance, a start-to-finish showcase not just of Mulaney’s sketch chops, but also of how his presence brought out the best in everyone. There’s the added cheeky frisson of that episode’s standout sketch being “Diner Lobster,” a tour de force rescued from the dustbin of rejected sketch infamy by the returning former writer’s newfound clout. If “Diner Lobster” was deemed too weird, ambitious, and, again, weird to fit into whatever Lorne Michaels and company’s conception of Saturday Night Live was when Mulaney wrote the thing (alongside Colin Jost), its triumphant resurrection was carried aloft by the ascendant Mulaney’s gleefully accomplished trajectory.

So let the debate begin as to whether tonight’s spiritual sequel, “Bodega Bathroom,” surpassed “Diner Lobster.” (It’s also unclear if this latest loopy musical extravaganza was also rescued from the dress rehearsal scrap pile.) Is it better? Hell if I know. But it is the best-case scenario for a presumably de rigueur sequel, an equally lavish, ludicrously surreal swing for the fences, complete this time with a Willy Wonka/Rent/Little Shop Of Horrors/Cats mashup, elaborately silly costuming, and a complete and utter lack of concern that anyone will find this tale of unwise New York tradition-busting too weird. Everyone shone, from Kenan Thompson’s Wonka/Cat In The Hat guide, to Cecily Strong and Melissa Villaseñor’s angelically singing cockroaches, to Kate McKinnon’s gloriously beneficent bodega Virgin Mary votive candle, to Mulaney, crooning with malign glee as the bodega owner whose horrific bathroom Pete Davidson’s patron unwisely chooses to use.

Mulaney’s monologue was unabashedly New York, complete with unerringly specific physical impressions of the new police car sirens, and his bulldog-stroller-pushing wife’s unblinking standoff with a pair of indelible New York figures. “Bodega Bathroom” partakes of the same lived-in, hometown vibe, with the songs’ lyrics dropping details like tampons always being stored on the highest shelf, either frozen or boiling bottled water, and “a guy who doesn’t work here watching soccer.” It also draws on the Broadway musical tradition that Mulaney’s recent episode of Documentary Now shows the comic knows as intimately as he does the halls of Studio 8H. It’s dippy, it’s delightful, and it’s a worthy companion to “Diner Lobster,” so, pretty much all we could have hoped for.

Best/Worst sketch of the night

Pretty much the worst thing I can think to say about any sketch tonight is that the Cinema Classics bit cut off a little abruptly, seemingly due to the timing issues that robbed us of Reese De’What’s customary closing and the show’s goodnights. Yeah, the episode was that good.

The weakest of a uniformly uproarious bunch is probably the toilet catapult ad, although Mulaney’s supremely confident commercial huckster sold the idea of a supposed dignity-saving device (to fling old people off of the can right before they die there) with aplomb. SNL commercial parodies often deal in scataology, and here the joke is the lengths to which we as a species will go to deny our bodily needs, even to the extremes of having our heart-attacking frail old bodies hurled across our homes. That even the ceiling-dropped respectable literature can’t obscure the fact of our loved ones finding us crumpled, beshitted, and disheveled—but not on the crapper—makes the bit bite. That and Mulaney’s straight-faced assurance that the device is “mostly accurate,” accompanied by a demonstration of elderly corpses being flung into walls works nicely.

You’ll have to read on to see my pick for best sketch of the night, but the wedding sketch worked exceptionally well. In addition to being a rare lead for Ego Nwodim, and a seamlessly executed piece of choreographed physical comedy (for the second week in a row), the piece is also refreshingly smart in its construction. The joke hinges on the old switcheroo, with Mulaney’s seemingly out-of-place white guy nervously accompanying his black girlfriend onto the dance floor of an all-black wedding. That Mulaney turns out to not only know every complicated group dance step Kenan’s DJ calls out, but apparently everyone else in attendance is the twist, but the joke works in how nimbly it avoids every hacky pitfall. Mulaney’s unexpected competence doesn’t make anyone a fool. Nwodim is suitably impressed, but, like the rest of attendees, doesn’t make a stereotypical spectacle of surprise at the premise. (Something SNL relies on again and again—you’re presenting the joke about someone doing something weird, so having spectators comment on how weird it is isn’t furthering the cause.)

Weekend Update update

Look, we all wanted Stefon. With Mulaney’s partner in cue-card-based shenanigans in the house, it seemed all but assured that we’d get an always welcome return from New York’s hottest nightlife expert. But we got plenty of Bill Hader elsewhere, and it’d be hypocritical to criticize Saturday Night Live for not doing the easy thing in bringing back a slam-dunk recurring bit, right? Let’s just move on.

Jost and Che were fine. It remains irritating that so much of Update’s political content gets shunted off on Alec Baldwin’s watery Trump as a rule, but they hit with intermittent power. Jost wisely let Trump’s rambling, 2-plus-hour speech at annual convention of the worst people in the country CPAC speak for itself in a distressingly lunatic series of clips. Meanwhile, he was content to jab at Cohen’s revelation that Trump had deployed Cohen to threaten Trump’s various schools should they reveal his academic records. (The joke that such sweaty obfuscation means that Trump’s true address is closer to 920 Pennsylvania Avenue than 1600 is a solid burn.) And Che continues to flip over comic premises to play wiseass devil’s advocate, here mocking Cohen’s sudden “damsel in distress” change of heart by saying that at least Trump appears to have the stubbornness to “slowly fall apart until he’s dragged off in handcuffs like a boss.” (“I mean that’s how I want to leave SNL,” he ad-libbed.)

There was only one correspondent piece tonight, but it was more than enough with Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon teaming up as a pair of meat-producing businesswomen. There was a bit of a tortured setup, with Jost introducing the idea that the internet keeps preventing people from tucking into delicious-but-adorable animals, and the spangled meat mavens claiming that their gift baskets are made only from real animal assholes. (Not real animal assholes, mind you, but animals that were real jerks before they were slaughtered.) But the bit was one of those happy trainwrecks, with Jost, Aidy, and McKinnon, apparently legitimately appalled at the odor emanating from the very real prop meat, getting the giggles and trying to keep things somehow on those tracks. Breaking on SNL is a dish best reserved for those special occasions where the performers, in spite of all best efforts at professionalism, find the live TV experience careening out of their control. (As opposed to finding themselves adorable. Yes, I’m still harboring Jimmy Fallon resentments.)

“What do you call that act?” “The Californians!”—Recurring sketch report

“What’s That Name?” had a few strikes against it going in. It brought in a high-profile SNL alum to steal focus from the current cast. Plus, it’s another goddamned game show, and a repeater as well. But the hell with all that, as the alum is Bill Hader, and the sketch—in which contestants can name the most D-list celebrities but not their friends’ girlfriends or their wives’ bridesmaids—remains a potently funny exercise in squirmy character comeuppance. No offense to capable current go-to gameshow host Beck Bennett, but no one in SNL history has brought more to the seemingly thankless role of the rules-and-questions straight man than Hader, and this is simply one of the best he’s ever done. With Mulaney and Strong’s players suitably chagrined at their embarrassing memory lapses, it’s Hader’s mastery of lines, pauses, and attitude that destroys throughout. Everyone’s made out their SNL all-time all-stars cast at one time or another (I re-jigger mine pretty much weekly), which is a fun game and all. But if Bill Hader’s not on your list, you’re incorrect. From the start of the sketch, Hader’s grinning host is clearly up to something, milking every reveal and every to-camera pregnant pause for maximum (but perfectly judged) effect.

Hader’s played innumerable such roles on SNL, but the way his Vince Blake hits the amount of Mulaney’s first prize (“That’s five dollars for you.”) signals, in Hader’s hint of controlled mania, just how much he’s going to enjoy springing the trap the game has set for his contestants/victims. There’s a terrifyingly hilarious glint in Hader’s eyes at each successive humiliation he hands out, a clockwork villainy that, yet, preys upon his charges’ real, if disproportionately punished, transgressions. That Mulaney’s lapses stem from an underlying sexism with regard to just who he thinks worthy of remembering, Hader takes delight in letting Mulaney twist. (“Finish that thought, Doug!”) And the capper is definitive, with Mulaney’s anguished question “What do you want?!” answered, chillingly, by Hader’s demonic, “In a word—chaos.”

Pete Davidson’s peerlessly noncommittal Chad is a reliable showcase for Davidson’s millennial stoner slacker persona. It’s always funny to watch those inexplicably obsessed with the blank Chad work themselves into a solipsistic tizzy around the amiable nonentity that is Chad, and “The Unknown Caller” scores by switching the usual romantic plot with the Scream-esque scheme of masked killer Mulaney to exact revenge for the childhood taunting his blasé nemesis has literally no memory of. Chad stays viable because there’s always been an undercurrent of privileged assholery to his amenable sort-of victimhood, and the fact that Mulaney’s murderous mastermind winds up hoisted on his own petard despite his target’s utter disregard for anything outside of himself just deepens the vapid mystery that is Chad.

“It was my understanding there would be no math”—Political comedy report

There were a pair of Jussie Smollett jokes tonight, one on Update and one on an all-lawyer edition of celebrity Shark Tank, where the Empire star attempts to secure the services of camera-hogging legal minds like Michael Avenatti, Alan Dershowitz, Kate McKinnon’s Nosferatu-like Rudy Giuliani, and Cecily Strong’s “Fox News banshee” Jeanine Pirro. With it looking at this point like Smollett inexplicably made up his harrowing account of a racist, homophobic attack, and the subsequent squeals of glee from right-wingers looking to cast a shadow over the very real rise in hate crimes since the election of Donald Trump, the subject is a fucking minefield for comedians not simply looking for the easiest and/or most distasteful laughs. With Chris Redd’s Smollett starting out by trying to claim that Donald Trump himself attacked him outside the soundstage, the sketch came out hacky, although the joke that Pirro has to recuse herself because of the fact that a gay black man making up a hate crime is both stolen from her Fox News fan fiction and bringing her to climax pulls it back a bit. The overwhelmed Smollett explaining that his reason for being there was that he “broke humanity” also struck a fine balance in the show’s approach to the clusterfuck that this whole event has made of America’s already debased public discourse.

Everyone in the sketch was dug in, which helped things along. Mulaney’s Dershowitz jumping in to offer his services brashly rattles off why: Smollett’s famous, probably guilty, “end of list.” Giuliani warns everyone not to feed him after midnight. (“Or it’s Gremlins city!”) Pete Davidson’s leering Avenatti twinkles with avaricious menace. Pirro deflects from the actions of Trump pal and Patriots owner Robert Kraft by steering the story into a rant about immigrant (and possibly trafficked) prostitutes stealing American jobs. And jingle-based TV lawyers Cellino and Barnes sing the praises of lucrative class-action add-ons to each case. Casting a wider net in the tiresome media types impersonation arena, it’s at least a more effortful way to approach some current events comedy.

The cold open ditched the out-of-the-country Trump in favor of the irresistible spectacle that was the congressional testimony of longtime Trump attorney and “fixer” (and former deputy finance chair of the Republican National Committee), Michael Cohen. As with “What’s That Name?,” the usual caveats apply: not one but two high-profile guests stealing focus; the cold opens’ recent history of plucking the low-hanging fruit. But, yeah, screw those. Ben Stiller’s Cohen strikes just the right note between verisimilitude to Cohen’s tough guy shiftiness and comic exaggeration. (That his testimony was written “with some help from the guys that wrote Green Book” is surprisingly apt.) But it’s Bill Hader’s sketch, as his belligerent, constantly thwarted Freedom Caucus showboater Jim Jordan (R-OH) sings with Hader’s inimitable blend of minute observation and fully inhabited performance.

The sketch has some funny bits from the cast proper. (I liked Kyle Mooney’s malaprop-spouting approximation of the incoherent questioning from Arizona GOP Congressman Paul Gosar.) But overall, the sketch leaned into the inescapable fact that this was the Bill Hader show. Ceding their time throughout back to Hader’s apoplectic Jordan in order to let the himself scandal-dogged congressman further hang himself (“I’d like to yield the rest of my time to Jim Jordan as a prank on him.”), the cast provided solid backup. Kenan Thompson’s Elijah Cummings rode herd over the proceedings with a humorously weary competence. But Hader (and, sure, Stiller) was the main attraction here, channeling the show’s political opener into his characterization of the Republicans’ hopelessly inept attempts to paint Cohen as a lying, dishonorable scumbag without acknowledging that he was a major player in the party and Donald Trump’s right-hand stooge for a decade. (And without addressing the many, many crimes and acts of general assholery Cohen claims Trump is guilty of.) Alex Moffat got in some blows portraying Congressman Mark Meadows’ (R-SC) widely derided “Trump can’t be racist, because he hired a black person” deployment of HUD figure Lynne Patton to rebut Cohen’s claims that Donald Trump is, in fact, a racist. The joke that Meadows thinks Patton is the similarly unqualified but no longer employed Omarosa is a canny way to underline Meadows’ flimsy tokenism, with Ego Nwodim’s fictional version of Patton at least getting to speak about how distastefully racist Meadows using her as a prop is. And, sure, someone had to throw a goddamned Kardashian joke into the mix, but there was a self-awareness to the conclusion where Kenan’s Cummings assumes that spotlight-stealer Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was just there for ratings-grabbing publicity purposes. “No, I was gonna ask, like, carefully researched questions,” said Villaseñor’s AOC, to which Cummings replied disdainfully, “Yeah, clearly that is not what today is about.”

I am hip to the musics of today

Thomas Rhett took to the Saturday Night Live stage like he’d been preparing for it his whole career. Which isn’t a compliment. Rhett’s overproduced, throwback light-country pop songs sounded a little like Kenny Loggins, which is sort of a compliment. Sometimes a dull act makes me try to spot how heavily the performer’s relying on a guide track, but for the grinning, performatively naughty Rhett, I honestly don’t imagine there’s much difference either way.

“What the hell is that thing?”—The Ten-To-Oneland Report

Because of show-timing issues (see below), technically the last segment of the night was Rhett’s second song, but Cinema Classics was the true ten-to-one entry this week. Mulaney is better as himself (or an exaggerated version thereof) than he is a character man, but the To Have And Have Not bit allowed his indifferent Humphrey Bogart to wisely play straight man to Kate McKinnon’s unexpectedly flustered Lauren Bacall. Seeing Kate McKinnon cut loose with some all-out physical comedy is one of the most potent weapons SNL has these days, and, here, her Bacall’s inability to maintain her seductive cool sees her going either hyper-verbal (“I should go to school.”) in discomfiture, or contorting her face with abandon as she attempts to pull of the whistle part of Bacall’s once-scandalous pickup line. It’s a funny little idea that gives Kate McKinnon the chance to do her thing. What else do you want?

Stray observations

SNL’s been a technical mess all season, but the ending tonight seemingly broke the network, with Rhett’s shoehorned second number starting at 12:54, leaving the show to end with two Mulaney photo bumpers, some noodling by the unseen band, and then (at least on my broadcast) a pair of blank screens marking the time with a three-toned peacock graphic.



“I roll with a group of problematic bachelors and we call ourselves . . . The Squad.” God, I love Bill Hader.



“No, you’re not seeing double—there’s three women there!”



Dramatically pausing after calling Donald Trump a racist, Stiller’s Cohen: “Thought that would get a bigger reaction.”



Yes, a United States congressman (that’s Paul Gosar, R-AZ) trotted out the “liar, liar, pants on fire” taunt during questioning, because we’re all so completely screwed. And, yes, he did make up a little poster.



“I would smell it up into my nose and I would get a high from it.”—Mulaney’s monologue assurance that he was once “a cool guy” who did cocaine.



Redd’s Smollett: “Spoiler for the next season of Empire: I die.”



For the second show in a row, we got a title card for a recently deceased SNL crew member. This time it was for Margaret Karolyi, who, for some three-plus decades, did the unceasing work of costuming a live 90-minute TV show—written and rewritten on the fly until the last second. RIP and thank you."

It fails to account for the real world. That’s why so many Never-Trumpers ended up being so wrong about the 2016 election. And that’s why they continue to stumble about in the dark and continue to make absolute fools of themselves, egged on by liberal pundits who revel that they can say, “I must be open-minded; I have conservative friends.”

Never-Trumpism is easy. Read a few conservative philosophers. Hold to a few core principles, no matter what. And express outrage at most of what Trump says. Adoration from the media and liberal friends will follow.

The failure of the Weekly Standard and the decline of the National Review have exposed the not-conservative Trump haters as unpragmatic, unrealistic snobs. They are now shaking the begging cup to keep from having to earn an honest living. In the face of the president’s rising popularity among voters and the economic and diplomatic successes of this administration, they continue to believe that on the right there are readers and donors who will keep them at it.

It is a mystery to me why so many politicians and pundits are suddenly committing career and party suicide. I suppose it’s because there has been a failure to recognize that they’ve been living in and promoting a fantasy world. In the meantime, the president has called their bluff, exposed the cant, and forced them into chaos and ruinous policies.

Never-Trumpers, with their unchanging views, can’t understand why the world does not agree with them and thus conclude that the world has gone mad. And this leads them to indulge in the feel-good drug of believing that they are the last intelligent and sane people in the country. Although they aren’t exactly clear on who died and left them in charge of the conservative intellectual tradition, they are adamant that they are the rightful heir.

The Weekly Standard eventually failed due to irrelevance. The Bulwark, established immediately to replace the aforementioned, will likely continue this tradition of irrelevance, only occasionally rising into the spotlight when some liberal television show needs a token conservative who has been beaten into submission.

It’s sad to see these minds, which have so much potential, wasting away in a fantasy land. Stuck on the drug of arrogant, uncritical pseudo-intellectualism.

Fat chance. The man they detest is carrying out policies they so often claimed to support, and the voters -- most of whom they look down on -- approve.

About 3-in-4 American voters favor a populist-nationalist “America First” legal immigration, trade, and foreign policy platform from candidates running for office that prioritizes protecting the way of life and economic security of United States citizens above all else. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll finds near unanimous support for populist-nationalist candidates among Republicans, conservatives, and President Trump supporters, as well as a majority of support from all voters. The findings are the latest evidence that the open borders, globalization, and endless wars ideology of former administrations -- such as President George W. Bush’s -- has very little support with the American electorate.

The voters hold these views, despite the media’s nonstop lying. Voters are just not as stupid as the media thinks we are.

And after the last few weeks’ Jussie Smollett and Covington Catholic fiascos, more is about to come. The Mueller report -- I know we keep thinking it’s just around the corner -- will prove to be another face plant for them. You don’t actually need to see the report to know this. To quote Glenn Greenwald’s tweet: ""[A]fter almost two years of the Mueller investigation, the number of Americans thus far indicted for criminally conspiring with Russia to influence the 2016 election is zero. We spend remarkably little time asking why this is.""

Don Surber has the answer to Greenwald’s question:

Counterintelligence Investigation is a cover-up to hide Obama's illegal spying on the Trump campaign using -- abusing -- our national security apparatus.



Bungling Bob Mueller and the media have spent two years trying to overturn the 2016 election. They cannot.



But an honest investigation would focus on Obama, Clapper, Brennan and Susan the Unmasker Rice.

Doubtless aware that the two-year political fiasco was coming to a disappointing end, Elijah Cummings and Adam Schiff, called convicted perjurer Michael Cohen to testify before the House Oversight Committee represented by Clinton spinner Lanny Davis.

Among the highlights are these, as Sharyl Attkisson reports:

Final nails in the coffins Nail 1 -- The Steele dossier: Cohen said, unequivocally, that he’s never visited Prague. That’s contrary to the now-discredited opposition research “dossier” the FBI presented to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain secret wiretaps. Nail 2 -- BuzzFeed’s “bombshell”: Cohen said Trump never directed him to lie to investigators about the timing of a Trump Tower Moscow project during the 2016 campaign. That discredited the BuzzFeed “bombshell” and multiple anonymous sources that claimed Cohen had told special counsel Robert Mueller that Trump ordered Cohen to lie. Mueller also previously disputed the same report. (Note: While Cohen denied the BuzzFeed allegations that Trump had directed him to lie, Cohen stated that he did lie on Trump’s behalf, because he assumed Trump meant for him to do so.) [snip] Worst luck Cohen estimated that he secretly recorded people 100 times — but couldn’t cite any recordings proving claims against Trump.

While this farcical Congressional investigation led by the very man who lied when he denied directing the IRS to target tea party groups was going on, his party was splitting with contentious recriminations as the few remaining “moderates” fought back against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ threat to mount primary challenges against them.

Triggering the blowup was Wednesday’s votes on a bill to expand federal background checks for gun purchases. Twenty-six moderate Democrats joined Republicans in amending the legislation, adding a provision requiring that ICE be notified if an illegal immigrant seeks to purchase a gun. That infuriated liberals who have railed against ICE’s role in conducting mass deportations and embarrassed Democratic leaders who couldn’t keep their members in line on a high-profile bill. The Democratic infighting reflects a fractured caucus and diverse freshman class, with dozens of moderates elected in districts that President Trump won in 2016 at odds with hard-charging liberals. The split has exposed divisions among Pelosi and her top lieutenants, Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), over the party strategy to keep its newfound majority.

When the Democrats held the White House, the Senate, and the House they did not vote to restrict gun ownership. Why? Because too many of them knew it would end their time in office. Only nincompoops could imagine such measures would pass muster with a party now less powerful.

In any event, kudos to the press and the Cortez wing for leading the party down a suicidal path, a path so clear even some in the media are alarmed about the far-left tilt of the ever-expanding kick line of Democratic would-be presidential nominees.

Others, stalwart supporters of the party, are happy in their suicidal fantasy of the prospects for an even more leftist party.

Beyond the media, there is an entire theory from the academy and coffee houses of Cambridge, Berkeley, and Madison to the effect that Democrats have been too far to the right for a long long time. Maybe my favorite example of leftists determined to brew up the Kool Aid for the 2020 campaign comes from The New Republic, a former magazine, where Alex Sheppard writes of “The Overdue Death of Democratic ‘Pragmatism.'” [snip] …This paragraph strikes me as especially wacko: The party’s rightward drift began in the mid-1970s, when the so-called “Watergate Babies” began to replace New Deal Democrats, but proceeded in earnest in the 1980s due to Ronald Reagan’s two landslide victories. The Democratic Leadership Council, formed in the wake of Walter Mondale’s defeat in 1984, pushed Democrats to embrace balanced budgets, welfare reform, and other centrist policies. The argument was that the Democratic Party must meet American voters where they were. [snip] First of all, losing 44 states in 1980 and then 49 states in 1984 does have a way of concentrating the mind about how to win an election, and high-octane leftism didn’t seem like the way. …this sentence that really jumps out: “The party’s rightward drift began in the mid-1970s, when the so-called “Watergate Babies” began to replace New Deal Democrats...” Sheppard has it exactly backwards. The so-called “Watergate babies” of 1974 marked the beginning of a major step change to the left for the Democratic Party… I hope (and expect) that liberals will continue to indulge their revisionist history and slouch toward a suicidal campaign, even as I stock up on popcorn.

Me too. Pass the popcorn."

""If they want our dollars and we give them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people to speak,"" said Trump in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

He did not describe how the executive order would work, or who would judge whether a college or university was not protecting free speech.

During his speech, President Trump brought on stage and praised Hayden Williams, who was punched last week when he was at the University of California, Berkeley, seeking support for the president and conservative causes and criticizing Jussie Smollett, the actor who is facing charges of false reporting to the police in a hate crime he claimed to have experienced.

Of Williams, President Trump said that he should sue Berkeley ""and maybe sue the state."" To loud applause, Trump said, ""He took a hard punch in the face for all of us. We can never allow that to happen."" And he added that after Williams sues Berkeley, ""he's going to be a very wealthy man."" The crowd at the meeting chanted ""USA"" as Trump made these statements.

Video has widely circulated showing Williams being punched.

Trump did not note that Berkeley arrested a man, Zachary Greenberg, for assaulting Williams. Neither Williams nor Greenberg are students at Berkeley. The university had permitted Williams to be on campus expressing his views.

Late Saturday, Berkeley released a new summary of what had happened, reiterating that the university had in this incident not wavered in its commitment to free speech or its willingness to take action in response to the attack on Williams. The statement said that events at the university have been ""willfully distorted and inaccurately reported.""

This is not the first time President Trump has used an incident at Berkeley to suggest that federal research dollars should be cut off over alleged denial of free speech rights.

In 2017, violent protesters (believed by university officials to be from off campus) set fires and damaged property at the university just before a scheduled appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos. President Trump tweeted:

If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

What he didn't note at that time was that Berkeley officials had allowed Yiannopoulos to speak, calling off the event only amid the violence. Berkeley had defended his right to appear on campus (and he has appeared since), citing principles of free speech even as some on campus said he should be kept away because of views many find offensive.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, in an interview shortly after President Trump's Saturday speech, called the proposed executive order ""a solution in search of a problem."" He said that is because ""free speech and academic freedom are core values of research universities.""

While ""controversies do arise,"" Hartle said that the norm is for universities to err on the side of promoting free speech. He asked how some federal agency in the future would try to enforce the executive order by determining whether a college had done enough to promote free speech. He predicted that an executive order would lead people to try to create free speech incidents just to stir up controversy.

And Hartle said that federal law gives religious institutions broad discretion about campus activities. ""Would religious institutions be required to have speakers whose views were antithetical to the college?"" Hartle asked. ""Would Yeshiva University be required to host a Holocaust denier?""

Hartle also noted the lack of consistency of the Trump administration about free speech.

""As always in the current environment, irony does come into play. This is an administration that stifles the views of its own research scientists if they are counter to the political views of the administration, such as on climate change. And the president vigorously attacks people like Colin Kaepernick who exercise their free speech rights.""

Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said via email, “Public research universities have a First Amendment constitutional obligation to protect free speech. It is an obligation they take very seriously and work hard to protect. Our campuses serve as important forums for the debate of diverse ideas. An executive order is unnecessary, as public research universities are already bound by the First Amendment, which they deeply respect and honor. It is core to their academic mission.”

The Trump Administration Record

Before he was president, Trump called for the National Endowment for the Arts to stop supporting, and for museums to stop displaying art he considers to be ""gross, degenerate stuff."" And while he has been president, his staff has taken actions -- such as blocking critics from the Trump Twitter feed -- that have led to the administration being sued over First Amendment concerns.

Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave several speeches denouncing the squelching of speech on college campuses. But Sessions was silent about (and declined to answer questions on) squelching that was done at the behest of Republican politicians, such as when the University of Kansas took down an artwork featuring the American flag after GOP leaders in the state demanded that it come down.

The Trump administration's officials talk regularly about Berkeley. The administration has been silent as Republican legislators in Tennessee have for years tried to kill a student-organized ""Sex Week"" at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville -- an event that does not use state funds.

Views of Groups That Focus on Free Expression

Among organizations that promote free expression on campus, the response to President Trump's Saturday speech was tepid.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released a statement that said in part, ""While we are glad that this important national issue has the president’s attention, we do not currently have any more information on the details of the executive order. We are looking forward to learning more about this initiative in the coming days.""

Jonathan Friedman, project director for campus free speech at PEN America, said via email, ""We need to see the text. On the surface the government reaffirming the importance of free speech on campus is appropriate and essential, particularly at a time of serious threats to open discourse. In practice, new and proposed measures ostensibly intended to protect speech can yield unintended negative consequences for speech, which we've documented in our work. While we at PEN America reserve judgment until a draft of the order is released, we believe that any government action on this issue should be approached in a thoughtful, nonpartisan manner, upholding the universal principles of free speech and academic freedom.""

Debra Mashek, executive director of Heterodox Academy, said via email that ""we need diversity and dialogue, not decrees.""

Added Mashek, “Heterodox Academy encourages individual colleges and universities to advance common-sense policies and practices that promote teaching, learning and discovery. Higher ed would not benefit from a blunt, top-down, partisan decree that politicizes the academy’s core values of open inquiry and academic freedom. Governments cannot legislate campus cultures. In order to create classrooms and campuses that welcome diverse people with diverse viewpoints and that equip learners with the habits of heart and mind to engage that diversity in open inquiry and constructive disagreement, colleges and universities must harness their own values, histories and capacities.”

Could Solomon Amendment Be a Model?

Many in higher education questioned how the executive order might work. Two proponents of the measure, however, say that the Solomon Amendment provides a model.

In an article in National Affairs last year, Frederick M. Hess and Grant Addison, both of the American Enterprise Institute, called for federal funds to be cut off to American colleges that do not support free expression on campus. They said that the precedent for this could be the Solomon Amendment, the 1996 law that barred federal funds from going to colleges and universities that did not permit military recruiting or Reserve Officer Training Corps programs on campus. The law came at a time when some colleges were barring the military from campus, citing its policies (since lifted) of discriminating against gay people. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 upheld the constitutionality of the amendment, which was challenged by law schools.

While there was no dispute that some colleges barred the military, in the case of free expression, some institutions (such as Berkeley) denounced by President Trump can point to evidence that they in fact support free expression.

""New federal guidance in this area has a chance to make free inquiry and free speech relevant to the broader scientific research community in a fashion that it has not been previously,"" says the article. ""The slumbering, silent middle on campus may awaken when accomplished researchers bringing in millions in 'indirect' costs suddenly recognize that the ideological crusades of their colleagues may imperil their laboratories and research projects. Campus leaders who have found it easy to virtue signal by indulging students and faculty demanding constraints on speech will now have a fairer fight on their hands, and they will need to be worried about their biochemistry and engineering faculty departing for institutions eligible for federal funds."""

To the Editor,

Climate change is happening here and now — and as a young person building a life for myself, it is overwhelming to see too many of our leaders failing to act to keep our communities safe from climate disaster in the future.

The latest climate report from the United Nations says we have only 12 years to transform our economy to preserve the stable climate human civilization has depended on for millennia. We need a massive mobilization of every sector of society on par with what science and justice demand.

A Green New Deal will keep Americans safe from climate change and create millions of green jobs. It is common sense policy that is overwhelmingly popular with American people, regardless of political party or where they live.

There is a Green New Deal on the table at every level of government in New York — at the city level, at the state level, and at the federal level. It’s time that our leaders take it up and act to save lives and the future now.Dana Affleck

Thank you for reading this! This letter is me saying, let’s get behind the Green New Deal. I am 37-years-old and have been frightened and paralyzed about climate change for so long. Ever since Sunrise Movement and the Green New Deal resolution, I’ve been so inspired and ready to participate in our democratic process.

A Green New Deal will keep Americans safe from climate change and create millions of good jobs, too. I’ve been calling my representatives every week to thank them for co-sponsoring this amazing resolution or encourage them to do so.

What a hopeful approach we have found in this resolution. We can squelch our climate change fears by getting behind this bold movement and getting the Green New Deal into law.Brooke LaGrand

To the Editor,

The UN’s latest climate report states that in order to limit global average temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, we, as a planet, need to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. Currently, global average temperature is 1 degree Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and we have already seen firsthand the negative effects it has had on our lives through increased weather intensity and global sea-level rise.

Humanity has 11 more years to limit global-average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and begin to reverse the horrible effects of climate change. The Green New Deal is the first step to making positive climate action in the U.S. Any political candidate, regardless of party affiliation, will not earn youth support unless they have the courage and common sense to back the Green New Deal. This is not the time to sit idly by, this is the time for action.Padriac Nugent

Since I was 8-years-old, I was told that the world was ending around me. I was told that my grandchildren would live to see the actual apocolypse if we didn’t do anything to stop it.

Now I’m 22-years-old and I have seen no progress. I have seen no responsibility from politicians. I have seen no accountability from corporations. And now I am told that I may live to see the end of the world. This global crisis demands drastic action immediately, which is why I see the Green New Deal as a glimmer of hope in a world growing darker by the day. It is our duty to our planet to make up for our wrongs, define where we stand, and create the legislature to save not only our species but all the inhabitants on Earth. Emma Witmer

To the Editor,

The truth is there whether we acknowledge it or not. That’s comforting in the days of Trumpism, but also deeply concerning at a time of increasing calamity from human-caused climate change. Many (including even leaders in the Democratic Party and strong environmental advocates such as Michael Bloomberg) have taken initial steps to paint the Green New Deal as “pie-in-the-sky” and unreasonable.

Besides using metaphors, which were already cliche when my grandparents were kids, they fail to acknowledge the exciting truth directly before us: there has never been a proposal to halt climate change that has been more reasonable than the Green New Deal. Why? Because the Green New Deal is the only major proposal we’ve seen to date that actually meets this colossal challenge with a plan bold enough to overcome it.

The plans that have been proposed so far, while well-intentioned and a good start, have been unreasonable in that they will not actually solve the tremendous problems we face. The latest climate report from the UN says we have only 12 years to transform our economy to preserve the stable climate human civilization has depended on for millennia. It is unreasonable to think that any plan short of a massive mobilization of every sector of society will solve this crisis. The good news? The Green New Deal will unleash prosperity and justice the likes of which the country, and this world, have ever seen.

We have been given an unimaginable gift to be conscious human beings on this earth and right now we’re blowing it. We owe it to ourselves to acknowledge this truth and act boldly to our potential before it’s too late. Will Blomker

We need truth

The protection of executive privilege is a path that allows professional politicians to legally lie. Withholding information is not in the public interest; the truth is what is needed to protect our democracy.

Release the complete Mueller report and everything else we have every right to know, because we are the people; and you work for us, are paid by us, and report to us!

The current POTUS is a shame; has been accused of divulging state secrets in the past, and lies 24-seven. This is not how our system of governance has been before, nor should be again in the future; assuming there is a future.

Media apology

To the Editor,

The media is now reporting that actor Jussie Smollett, who is black and gay, was arrested after finally coming clean about his staged homophobic, anti-Trump, and anti-black noose attack.

After weeks of media hype, the actor and media have a tremendous amount of damage control to perform. In addition, they should approach the black community, in fact all of America, and make public apologies for what was almost done.

Sadly, today, we live in a racially charged society, much of it brought to fruition by the media. All it takes to set off this tinderbox in certain cities is false reporting, and the bloodshed begins.

May the Chicago police throw the book at Jussie, though, watch and see the liberal slap on the hands he gets. Robert W. Lobenstein

Drug addition

To the Editor,

I strongly agree with Nicole Malliotakis that any facilities where drug addicts can legally inject themselves with heroin or other addictive drugs should be illegal (“She’s sticking it to him” by Colin Mixson, Bay News, Feb. 22–28). I think the mayor should use the money he would allocate to these clinics to provide addicts with rehabilitation programs and to get drug dealers off the streets.

I wonder if the mayor is aware that providing clinics where addicts can legally and supposedly safely take illegal and addictive drugs would encourage more teenagers and others to try these drugs. It seems like the city is sanctioning the use of illegal drugs while, at the same time, trying to prevent or save users from overdosing. Does this make sense?

Is the mayor aware that these clinics would create two new serious problems? One would be the drug dealers waiting outside the clinics to sell addicts more drugs before or after they shoot up. The second would be the addicts who drive to the clinics, take their drugs, and then attempt to drive home.

Mr. DeBlasio, please use this money to rehabilitate drug addicts instead, and to prevent those not yet addicted from ever starting on drugs.

SNL took on the scandal in a Shark Tank parody sketch starring Chris Redd as Smollett.

In the Shark Tank: Legal Edition sketch, several controversial legal names listened as scandal-plagued guests gave pitches as to why they deserved representation.

Redd's Smollett was one of the guests to come before the panel that included Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), Alan Dershowitz (John Mulaney) and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon).

'I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,' Redd's Smollett immediately declared as he appeared in front of the Sharks.

The panel responded, saying: 'Jussie, is that true?'

The actor then questioned if there were cameras outside.

When informed there were cameras outside that would have recorded the attack, Redd's Smollett backtracked saying 'then no, it is not'.

The panel then asked Smollett why he asking for representation.

'I broke humanity but if you take my case, I'm offering spoilers for next season of Empire. I died.. I died.'

Strong's Pirro responded: 'Wow, a gay, black man lying about an attack, I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this but I never thought it would come true. I'm recusing myself, cause I'm just too turned on.'

Meanwhile, Mulaney's Dershowitz said: 'Jussie, you have everything I love in a client. You're famous, you're probably guilty. End of list.'

Smollett (left and right played by Redd on SNL) was arrested last month after claiming two men randomly beat him up, racially abused him, tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him in Chicago

Smollett has been charged with a single felony count of filing a false police report.

Police have said the actor paid two Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, to attack him on January 29 in what was billed as a hate crime.

Smollett told Chicago police officers that his attackers, who were masked and whose faces he could not see, called him a 'f****t', a 'n****r' and shouted: 'This is MAGA country!'

Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two counts of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution.

He was among hundreds of men charged in a crackdown on massage parlor prostitution and an investigation into human trafficking at Florida spas.

'Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,' Bennett's Kraft said.

'I'm also the only person to ever take a private jet straight to a $59 hand job. I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.'

Davidson's Avenatti followed up with a 'beat it' joke.

Meanwhile, Strong's Pirro said the 'real criminal' was the 'immigrant woman that stole that job from a soft, white American hand'."

""Saturday Night Live"" had a field day with Michael Cohen's testimony before Congress, enlisting the talents of Ben Stiller to reprise his role as President Donald Trump's former personal attorney.

The comedy showcase opened with a scene from Wednesday's Capitol Hill spectacle, with Kenan Thompson playing U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, who presided over the Cohen hearing and laid down the rules.

""Please do not ooh and ah,"" he said. ""This is not 'Married... with Children.'""

Cohen opened his testimony, in which he accused Trump of being a racist, by saying, ""I had some help from the guys who wrote Green Book.""

He acknowledged lying before Congress during previous testimony, but Cohen promised this time would be different. ""I know that I was wrong,"" he said, ""and I know it because I got caught.""

March 2, 2019

By Peter Lemiska The Jussie Smollett case has quickly become nothing but a bad dream. But not that long ago, it took Democrats and Trump-haters across the country on an emotional roller-coaster ride. When his story first surfaced, liberal politicians, celebrities, and news commentators gushed with boundless compassion for Smollett and sneered with contempt for his presumed white attackers. ""This is America in 2019,"" one commentator lamented, her voice dripping disgust. Yet all the while, they suppressed an almost palpable glee – the exuberance that comes with vindication. They believed Smollett had given them irrefutable proof that America had become a racist country under Donald Trump's presidency.Then, in an instant, it was gone. They were left stunned and dumbfounded, duped by a charlatan from their own ranks. After learning the whole thing was a hoax, a few did some perfunctory soul-searching. Some announced they would wait – belatedly – for all the facts. A few even continued supporting Smollett. Evoking memories of O.J. Simpson, they theorized that ""racist"" police were trying to railroad an innocent black man.But Democrats don't need Smollett to denounce President Trump as racist and the cause of today's racial divide.Yes, the divide is real. One Gallup Poll indicates that 42 percent of Americans were worried about race relations in 2017 vs. just 17 percent in 2014.But the problem began long before Trump was elected.A chart prepared by the same polling company depicts the perception of race relations in America between 2001 and 2016. It shows that between 2001 and 2012, most Americans, black and white, consistently saw race relations as ""very good"" or ""somewhat good."" It was in 2013, mid-way through Barack Obama's presidency, that attitudes on race relations took a dramatic turn south.With the election of America's first black president, Democrats discovered just how versatile a weapon the race card could be. They used it mercilessly, relentlessly to attack Obama's critics. Anyone who raised questions about his birth certificate or his unexplained social security number was labeled racist. Those who were suspicious of his Muslim background or his long-time association with America-hating Jeramiah Wright, they, too, were called racist. Those who dared challenge his unilateral DACA decree and liberal border policies were attacked as racist. Even the political opponents who challenged his socialist doctrine of wealth redistribution were branded as racist.Obama's election launched a national obsession with racism, and he did nothing to quell it.As a presidential candidate, Obama pontificated about racial unity with inspirational words like these: ""There is not a Black America and a White America...there's the United States of America."" As president, his rhetoric changed. In 2016, at a memorial service for slain police officers in Dallas, he was somehow compelled to talk about the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, adding, ""If we're honest perhaps we've heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts...No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments.""During his presidency, the fanatical anti-police organization, ""Black Lives Matter,"" was born, and Obama wasted no time embracing it. During lighter times, he related personal anecdotes, like the time, as a young professional, he was allegedly mistaken for a valet while waiting for his car.Perhaps, in his mind, Obama was only highlighting the remnants of Jim Crow, but who can doubt that those subtle references and innuendoes contributed to the widening racial divide? In fact, Obama started with a country that was reasonably content with race relations and left a country that felt angry, shamed, and deeply divided.Donald Trump was elected with his promise to reverse the policies implemented by Obama, especially those related to border security. For that, Democrats wasted no time branding him and his supporters as racist.Today, they are more obsessed than ever with racism. They try to eradicate America's past by tearing down historic monuments. In schools, venues are established where no white students are welcome, and they're learning concepts once inconceivable to Americans – white guilt and white privilege. And while teachers and professors are convincing students to accept responsibility for something they never did, Democrat presidential candidates are talking about reparations for something that happened 150 years ago.Dr. Martin Luther King understood the evils of racism, but he focused on the future. He had a dream. He saw a future, where skin color played no role in one's destiny, where his children would not be ""... judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" That dream of a color-blind nation will never be realized as long as Democrats continue to obsess about our racist past. And it certainly won't ever happen as long as they perpetuate racial division with baseless allegations of bigotry.They didn't find what they wanted in the Smollett case, but they'll keep looking. They'll root around through prison statistics. They'll scrutinize police methods. They'll scrounge through decades-old high-school photos, and they'll remain ever vigilant for those inappropriate jokes or careless words they can use to show America's bigotry.But these champions of racial justice somehow overlook the impact their false and inflammatory accusations have made over the years. Gullibility isn't a crime, but after tiptoeing away from Jussie Smollett and the damage he's done to race relations, they never once reflected on their own contributions to the racial divide.© Peter Lemiska"

Every newsroom in the country used to have what was called the “AP Stylebook” to use in writing news stories.

Now you need two AP stylebooks, one for Democrats, about whom seldom is heard a discouraging word, and a second for the GOP, with a hundred different pejoratives.

Two parties, two vocabularies. One positive, one negative — very bad, evil in fact.

Consider the testimony by Michael Cohen last week in front of various Congressional committees.

For example, since he worked for Donald Trump, Cohen was described about a million times as a “fixer.” Democrats, on the other hand, have lawyers.

To prevent the release of embarrassing information, Democrats’ lawyers negotiate NDA’s — nondisclosure agreements. Republican fixers’ NDAs are “hush money,” or “bribes.”

Hillary Clinton paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrat operatives who then bought or made up false Russian dirt on Trump — that was opposition research. Republicans, on the other hand, “collude!”

Republicans lie, Democrats misspeak.

Democrats plan, Republicans scheme.

Republicans hire lobbyists, Democrats use advocates. Republicans employ operatives or hired guns, Democrats prefer community activists.

If a Democrat changes his or her position on an issue, they have evolved … grown. Republicans “flip-flop.”

Whenever an unfamiliar politician is ensnared in some scandal, you naturally wonder which party he or she is a member of. If the “embattled” pol is a Republican, affiliation is usually noted in the headline, or at the very latest in the first paragraph.

If, however, you reach the third paragraph of the story without his party being identified, you can be absolutely certain you are reading about a Democrat miscreant.

Likewise, accusers are handled differently depending on who exactly they’re accusing. Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was almost derailed by the not particularly credible “Dr.” Christine Blasey Ford. One of the women who’s accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Virginia of sexual assault likewise has a Ph.D., but how often does the alt-left media refer to “Dr. Vanessa Tyson.” Fairfax, you see, is a Democrat.

Was Jussie Smollett’s fake hate crime ever referred to as “alleged?” Of course not. But all the real, documented, videotaped attacks on conservatives — invariably they are alleged, or “according to police reports.”

A Republican tax cut is a “corporate giveaway” for the rich, a boon to “one percenters” that the government “can’t afford.”

A Democrat-proposed tax increase, though, is an “investment in the future.” It’s for the children.

When there’s bad news about Republicans, Democrats “react.” But Republicans “pounce” or “seize.” Often, in fact, the only way any Democrat woes get mentioned at all in the media is when Republicans seize and pounce, not to mention “weaponize” Democrat scandals.

Let’s talk about legislation. When a Democrat solon finds a way to stop some GOP initiative, it’s because the brilliant parliamentarian (Nancy Pelosi?) has come up with a master stroke.

But when a Republican, say Mitch McConnell, does exactly the same thing, he is invariably called an obstructionist, relying on “arcane” tricks to produce “gridlock” and overturn centuries of “Congressional tradition.”

When Democrats in Congress hold oversight hearings, they are never less than “historic” “explosive,” full of “bombshells.” The Cohen hearings were so explosive, in fact, that I was expecting to see footage Wednesday night of the Capitol in smoking ruins.

Republican-run Congressional hearings are always described as grandstanding, sideshows, overreach and a total waste of taxpayer money.

Finally, the word of the day is “smirk.” Remember January’s first big fake-news hoax — the Covington Catholic high school students at the Lincoln Memorial. The kid in the Make America Great Again hat that day was Nicholas Sandmann, and he’s now suing the Washington Post for $250 million.

Every Social Justice Warrior on Twitter said the 16-year-old had it coming because of the “smirk” on his face. That was the smart word of the day — smirk.

So last week the illegal immigrant from Brazil who assaulted — allegedly — the 23-year-old MAGA-hat- wearing American in the bar in Falmouth was grabbed by ICE for being in the country illegally for 25 years. She got a big-time lawyer and he said, basically, that after getting boozed up, the illegal immigrant went all Third World on the American taxpayer because of his “smirk.”

So now apparently it’s OK to assault anyone wearing a MAGA hat … if they’re “smirking.”

No wonder half of America is beyond smirking at the alt-left media’s agitprop on behalf of the Democrats. The deplorables aren’t smirking anymore, they’re sneering.

Beck Bennett played the businessman who was accused of soliciting prostitutes earlier this week, receiving laughs when he walked out, while Chris Redd played the actor and musician, which elicited audible surprise and concern from the audience when they realized the show would be taking on the headline-grabbing story about Smollett being attacked in Chicago in what appeared to be a hate crime but is now being investigated as a set up.

Both men appeared in front of the panel of sharks for help. This panel consisted of Pete Davidson as Michael Avenatti, Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, Kate McKinnon as “the man, the myth, the leper” Rudy Giuliani, and episode host John Mulaney as the “scourge of Martha’s Vineyard,” Alan Dershowitz.

“After I started defending Trump, no one invited me to parties anymore,” Mulaney as Dershowitz said. “I wish I could go back to defending good people, like O.J.”

Alex Moffatt and Kyle Mooney also appeared as “jingle based attorneys” Cellino and Barnes.

“Sharks, I am currently in some hot water over an accusation I went to a day spa in Florida and got what turned out to be a not-so happy ending,” Bennett as Kraft said. I’m also the only person to ever take a private jet straight to a $59 hand job. I am seeking an attorney who will make sure no one sees the video of my 77-year-old pigskin getting tossed around.”

While Davidson as Avenatti made “beat it” jokes, Strong as Pirro commented on the “real criminal” being the “immigrant woman that stole that job from a soft, white, American hand.” Meanwhile, McKinnon as Giuliani made a plea to be selected as the counsel, saying he would “happily go on TV, contradict everything you’ve ever said and then add some additional damaging information free of charge.”

When it came time for Redd as Smollett to address the panel, he said, “Hey everyone you won’t believe this, but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself.”

When he was asked if it was true, he asked if there were cameras outside, and upon hearing that there were, he rescinded his statement. When asked why he was here, he said, “I broke humanity? But if you take my case, I am offering spoilers for the next season of ‘Empire.’ I die.”

Strong as Pirro said she “wrote Fox News fan fiction” about “a gay, black man lying about being attacked” — but she admitted she never thought it would come true. She recused herself because she was “just too turned on.”

Mulaney as Dershowitz told Redd as Smollett that he had everything he wanted in a client; he was “famous and probably guilty.” On the other hand, though, the Cellino and Barnes jingle was reworded to say even they “won’t touch this.”

“Then no, it is not,” he says.

Next, when asked why he is here, SNL Smollett replies, “I broke humanity.”

Redd’s Smollett then says if the shark tank lawyers take his case, he will give out spoilers for the next season of Empire where he dies.

“Oh wow! A gay black man lying about an attack,” SNL’s Jeanine Pirro — one of the legal sharks as played by Cecily Strong — then chimes in. “I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this. But I never thought it would come true. I’m recusing myself. Because I am just too turned on.”

In a Shark Tank-esque sketch, several popular legal names, including Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), Alan Dershowitz (John Mulaney) and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), attempted to give legal guidance to celebrities caught in controversy.

Smollett (Chris Redd) was the show's second guest and appeared to make new explosive against the President.

""Hey everyone, you won't believe this but I was just attacked outside the studio by Donald Trump himself,"" he said.

Dershowitz responded: ""Jussie, is that true?""

""Are there cameras outside?"" He asked, after Dershowitz said yes he clarified it was not true.

Avenatti asks, ""Why exactly are you here today?""

""I broke humanity?"" he said. ""But if you take my case I'm offering spoilers for the next season of Empire, I die.""

Pirro added, ""Wow, a gay, black man lying about an attack, I wrote Fox News fan fiction about this but I never thought it would come true. I'm recusing myself, cause I'm just too turned on.""

""Jussie, you have everything I love in a client. You're famous, you're probably guilty. End of list,"" Dershowitz said.

Smollett was caught in controversy after new evidence on his alleged ""hate crime"" in Jan. 26 surfaced, leading Chicago Police to believe he might have staged the attack himself.

The actor was charged with a felony charge for falsifying a police report last Thursday and was arrested. After his release the actor returned to work, though a day later Empire producers announced the series would cut his character, Jamal Lyon, from the series to prevent further disruption to the production of the final two episodes of the season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" the said in a joint statement. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.""

Smollett continues to maintain his innocence.

In January the US Supreme Court allowed Trump's transgender military ban to go into effect.

Sputnik has discussed the issue with James Fetzer, a former Mraine Corps officer and Professor Emeritus at University of Minnesota.

Sputnik: In your view how would President Trump's ban on transgender people in the army affect the US military?

James Fetzer: As a former Marine Corps commissioned officer, I believe that the consequences would be relatively modest, that this is a political issue.

Virtually all military officers would agree that women or transgenders in combat is a bad idea but that women or transgenders in supporting roles such as logistics or administrative can work, but it turns out to be basically a political issue as to whether or not transgenders or women ought to be serving in the American military forces.

James Fetzer: Well the Obama administration was very deeply involved in the transgender and gay movement and community. It’s a complex issues about which the American people themselves do not have a clear understanding, but they themselves were deeply involved.

Joan Rivers, for example, the American comedian, observed that Obama was the first gay president and that Michelle was herself a transgender, which was in fact, I think, the reason why they moved aggressively to promote the idea of transgenders or gays serving in the military and opposed the policy heretofore, 'don’t talk about it, don’t say,' which worked well enough, but where they wanted to go further.

The Democratic Party has now become very much the party of transgender and gay rights along with identity politics where they emphasise issues of gender, issues of race, and to a lesser degree issues of religion, but where that has become central to democratic politics today.

James Fetzer: The American Armed Forces have received only relatively minimal benefit from having transgenders or gays openly serving in the military, and that’s because they have plenty of conscripts, there are plenty of members that serve; this was adding therefore only modestly to their numbers. It is because of political issues that the Democrats have move forward with it.

In fact, given the collapse of the Russian hacking allegations, where it turns out that there was in fact no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia, the benefits have been purely political and now the Democrats are out to make Trump out to be some kind of mobster and a racist which I think is going to be very difficult to sell to the American people.

He's had a long history of good race relations in New York City and, in fact, it turns out that he had even received a humanitarian award, he got the Ellis Island Medal of Honour in 1986 for his patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity along with Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks. So it’s going to be a tough case to make but that's the case the Democrats want to make.

Sputnik: So is it likely to make the army service less attractive for many in the US?

James Fetzer: Well obviously if there is a ban on transgenders that will lessen the opportunity for transgenders to serve in the military, that’s the obvious consequence. It gives an issue to the Democrats to campaign against the present President as though he was anti-transgender and somehow homophobic, which I do not believe to be the case.

And indeed the Democrats have gone so far as to actually fabricate incidents that are going to give them or they thought were going to give them political ammunition against Trump. For example, the Jussie Smollett case in Chicago recently, where this actor for the television show 'Empire' claimed to have been attacked by two men that about 2 am in the morning in freezing weather turns out it to have been completely contrived.

The two men who attacked him were not white, they were black, one was an extra on the set and the other was a former personal trainer for Jussie Smollett. He had orchestrated the whole event with a script, where they were carrying a bottle of bleach they allegedly threw on him, but it would have been frozen solid in that temperature, besides who is going to be out at 2am in the morning carrying a bottle of bleach looking for a gay black actor to attack. The whole story was absurd, but the Democrats thought they had something that was going to give emphasis to their campaign that portrays Trump as a racist and now, of course, with Michael Cohen's testimony, a mobster.

Sputnik: Why in your opinion did the Supreme Court rule to uphold the modified ban on gender dysphoria policy?

James Fetzer: Well the Supreme Court, I think, would recognize the role of the commander-in-chief of the military to determine what would be best for the military. Frankly, my own experience as a Marine Corps officer would reinforce the idea that, for example, having women who are transgenders in combat is a very bad idea. The military is not a group of very sophisticated individuals.

Transgender issues are not something they easily understand, that’s much more appropriate for sophisticates in New York and ultra-liberal groups than it is for members of the American military, particularly in combat situations it’s a bad idea to have the genders mixed because in the military, the soldier's mind is likely to be on sex instead of on combat.

So I believe myself that women in combat roles or transgenders for that matter is a bad idea, that it would be acceptable for them to be involved in logistics or administrative support but, with the Supreme Court I believe its deferred here, and appropriately so, to the views of the military in this matter and the President's role as commander-in-chief.

James Fetzer: Well of course it’s expensive to have transgender operations. I've noticed calculations recently that it would run between $1 and $2 million for having the service personnel undergo sex-change operations, and that’s a drop in the bucket in relation to the American military budget.

On the other hand, I think it’s a perfectly reasonable question whether the military ought to be performing the surgeries of this kind on behalf of soldiers. I think that’s a very difficult issue to sort out, and I believe the American taxpayers would be very divided on this issue. Once again, the decisions in this particular case are really basically political rather than military.

I don’t believe it is a significant issue overall in relation to the military budget, but I respect the court's recognition that the military has the right to decide these issues and particularly the crucial role of the commander-in-chief.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

No doubt this was because, like nearly everyone, you found this actor’s harrowing tale of racist and homophobic victimization so convincing.

Indeed, it speaks volumes that no less a person than President Trump was leading that chorus, which included a who’s who of politics, entertainment, sports, and social media. Now comes this, according to CNN on Feb. 1:

Arrested and charged

More than three weeks after he alleged that he was the victim of a hate crime, actor Jussie Smollett has been arrested on suspicion of filing a false report about it, Chicago police said Thursday morning.

Smollett faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report claiming he was attacked by two men, including one who was masked, in the early morning of January 29 in Chicago. He alleged they yelled racist and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him.

Truth be told, I smelled a rat from the outset. Close friends will attest as much. But there can be no greater evidence of my disbelief than my refusal to join that Smollett chorus.

Nobody can accuse me of being hesitant to express my opinion on politically charged events of the day. That’s what I do here. But I pride myself on being assiduously informed and scrupulously fair-minded. This means that, despite my inclination to believe even #MeToo victims, I always reserve judgment until credible and corroborating facts allow me to chime in.

Don’t need approval

It probably helps that I never felt the need to join the maddening crowd of twits on social media, where spewing baseless opinions and snarky comments (on everything) is the best way to win “likes” and influence “followers.” I have decried this dumbing down of public discourse in many commentaries, including “Why I Hate Twitter,” posted on February 1, 2013.

What’s more, I am old enough to remember the infamous Tawana Brawley case (which is why the Rev. Al Sharpton would’ve been well-advised to keep his mouth shut in this case).

And we all know that White folks like Charles Stuart and Susan Smith have a shameful history of falsely blaming Blacks for their crimes, real and imagined. I refer you to the litany of racial hoaxes that Katheryn RussellBrown documents in her 1998 book, “The Color of Crime: Racial Hoaxes, White Fear, Black Protectionism, Police Harassment, and Other Macroaggressions.”

Mind you, this does not mean that I have always been right. But on those rare occasions when I was not, I never hesitated to ‘fess up – as a search on my blog of “I was wrong” will show.

This is why I have little regard for those who rush to judgment based on little more than tribal passions. And that regard roils into contempt when they compound that rush by deleting posts and tweets in a vain attempt to avoid fessing up to their mistakes.

A sick man

That said, I have seen and read enough to believe that Smollett is a sick, misguided man. But this does not avail him of any diminished-capacity defense. Because, like my title indicates, he is just a feature creature of this age, in which there are no bounds to the things people do or say for attention.

Meanwhile, Smollett has probably never been happier. And he can be forgiven for assuming that his high-priced lawyer, Mark Geragos, will do for him what he has repeatedly done for Chris Brown: namely, get him off without doing any time. Justice would have Smollett serve “time-out” for at least half of the many years he faces for this and related crimes.

Sadly, he probably couldn’t care less about the repercussions his sensational lies will have on real hate crimes against Black, Jewish, and LGBTQ people, which are in fact on the rise. Case in point: the media are providing wall-to-wall coverage of this hoax while practically ignoring the February arrest of a White nationalist who was plotting to massacre thousands, most notably Black and Jewish politicians and reporters.

Even closer to home, Smollett probably couldn’t care less that he has now made a mockery of the positive and life-affirming role he plays as a beloved, openly gay man on the hit TV show, “Empire.”"

On Friday, March 1, campus police booked Zachary Greenberg, 28, into jail after he was believed to be the man who was caught on camera punching the conservative activist at the university campus on Feb. 19.

Greenberg allegedly hit Williams multiple times, including directly in the face, according to the video.

“UCPD will formally present the case to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office for consideration of the filing of criminal charges,” the UC Berkeley Public Affairs team announced in a campus statement.

“Once the matter is presented and reviewed by the District Attorney’s Office, additional information will be made available regarding a charging decision,” the statement concluded.

Greenberg is being held on a $30,000 bail, according to local media.

Following Greenberg’s arrest, Charlie Kirk, founder and president of TPUSA, issued a statement, calling the evidence in the case “incontrovertible.”

“Today, we have finally learned the identity of the attacker and that the violent man has been arrested,” his statement read. “While every America should be afforded their due process, we believe that the video evidence in this case is incontrovertible.”

“We hope 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg is prosecuted to the full extent of the law for assault with a deadly weapon, which should be considered an act of hate,” he continued. “Hopefully, this dark chapter will act as a wake up call to those concerned about actual politically motivated hate crimes in America. Berkeley and all college campuses across American should be safe havens for free thought and opinions—especially for a targeted conservative minority.”

I’m with brave students at @UCBerkeley, where an ACTUAL hate crime took place last week Yet it received virtually ZERO coverage I guess a conservative being attacked by leftists is less pressing than Jussie Smollett attacking himself Hate crime hoaxes hurt REAL victims! RT pic.twitter.com/8wbparUU1O — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 26, 2019

The Violent Incident

The activist, Hayden Williams, was manning a table recruiting for Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a conservative student organization operating on 1,400 campuses.

The display had signs reading, “Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims” and “This is MAGA Country”—a reference to the case of Jussie Smollett, a TV actor charged with staging a racially motivated attack on himself. Smollett had tried to frame supporters of President Donald Trump by claiming the attackers referenced Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Williams was then approached by critics and began to record the encounter.

“I’m just going to video it for my own safety, because you seem really erratic,” he told one person who accused him of “encouraging violence.” His actions only angered the pair more and he was attacked moments later, reported the Washington Enquirer.

The video of the incident was posted on Twitter by Charlie Kirk, president of TPUSA, and had over 2 million views by March 1.

“Imagine if the attacker was wearing MAGA hat, would be national news!” Kirk wrote in the tweet. “This is the violent left!”

In response to the incident, the university expressed “unwavering” commitment to “freedom of expression and perspective.”

“Let there be no mistake, we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason,” Chancellor Carol Christ said in a message to the campus community. “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here.”

Williams is a field representative for the conservative Leadership Institute, a training organization for conservative activists.

“The fact that the victim was not a campus affiliate has no bearing on this case,” campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof said. “He had every right to be on campus, and every right to express his point of view.”

“There’s a certain culture there that is especially hostile on Berkeley’s campus and across the country to conservative students,”Williams said in an interview with Fox Business Network. “They’re willing to use violence if they think you’re being too controversial.”"

Noah tackled the topic this week in one of his usual headline round-ups on the Comedy Central news-style series, detailing how India and Pakistan are in serious danger of going to war after a devastating terrorist attack on Valentine's Day killed 40 Indian troops. Amid the ongoing hostilities, Noah tried to imagine what a war between the two countries would look like.

""Obviously, I hope India and Pakistan don't go to war,"" he said. ""But if they did go to war, it would probably be the most entertaining war of all time, yeah?""

I’ve really always liked ur humour @Trevornoah. Really have. And we In India have a good sense of humour. This still crosses a line. We’ve lost our forces to terror attacks. Somehow it doesn’t sound as funny. #JustSaying #TheDailyShow pic.twitter.com/qknBmi6qfd — Sonal Kalra (@sonalkalra) February 28, 2019



Noah went on to do a prolonged impression of sing-song gunfire with an Indian accent. He added that it would be ""the longest war of all time"" with ""dance number"" breaks, referencing India's booming Bollywood industry.

Many are outraged at Noah, feeling that the whole bit was insensitive. The outraged fans flooded to Twitter, admonishing Noah and even swearing off of his show in some cases.

""I’ve really always liked [your] humour [Trevor Noah]. Really have,"" wrote Indian journalist Sonal Kalra. ""And we In India have a good sense of humour. This still crosses a line. We’ve lost our forces to terror attacks. Somehow it doesn’t sound as funny. #JustSaying.""

""Racist. Stereotypical. And downright offensive,"" added photographer Ritesh Uttamchandani. ""It is true indeed, these days the moment you think someone is cool and wise, they do a [Trevor Noah] on you and flush down the entire goodwill!""

Noah finally responded to the outrage on Saturday, including the many fans who felt that his own history with violence should have led him to know better.

""Actually if you watch my stand up you'll see that I did make jokes after my mother was shot in the head,"" he wrote. ""As a comedian I use comedy to process pain and discomfort in my world but I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that's not what I was trying to do.""

""It's amazing to me that my joke about the conflict in India and Pakistan trended more than the story of the actual conflict itself,"" he added later. ""Sometimes it seems like people are more offended by the jokes comedians make about an issue than the issue itself.""

The Daily Show has been on a hot streak lately, with a couple of other viral moments addressing the Jussie Smollett scandal. The show airs on weeknights at 11 p.m. ET on Comedy Central."
