LOS ANGELES - The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the ""Empire"" star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it's all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump's election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett's own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had ""shifted"" — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police ""are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released.""

Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to co-operate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

""And Libs wonder why we don't believe their BS stories,"" Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push ""the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.""

The response from Smollett's celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn't know what to say, but that the situation is a ""mess"" and a ""travesty.""

""I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,"" Gay wrote. ""The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.""

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a ""modern-day lynching."" On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she ""can't blindly believe"" the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it's that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: ""Whatever the outcome, this won't stop me from believing others. It can't.""

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

""I'm not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,"" Gay wrote. ""Because more often than not they are telling the truth.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, maintains that he was the victim of a brutal hate crime in late January. But after weeks of twists and turns, he became a suspect, and was charged with felony counts for allegedly lying about the incident. Less than a month later, all of his charges with dropped, leaving even more confusion about the case.

How did all of this happen?

Here's what went down:

Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox

Jan. 22: One week before the reported attack, a letter threatening Smollett arrives at the Fox studio where ""Empire"" is filmed. The letter, later published by TMZ, contained a homophobic death threat against Smollett spelled out in cut-up letters. The envelope reads ""MAGA,"" an apparent reference to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Jan. 29: Chicago police open a hate crime investigation after Smollett, 36, says he was attacked near his Chicago apartment. According to police, Smollett says two men approached him around 2 a.m., shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs,"" poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.

Police confirm to CBS News that in second interview with police, Smollett told detectives his attackers yelled ""This is MAGA country.""

Jan. 30: Chicago police release a photo of two ""persons of interest"" captured on surveillance footage, while noting that the attack itself was not captured.

While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed pic.twitter.com/xJDDygtocr — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) January 31, 2019

Feb. 1: Apparently noting the skepticism that some have raised about the attack, Smollett releases a statement saying he has been ""100% factual and consistent on every level."" ""Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" he writes.

Feb. 2: Smollett makes his first public appearance since reporting the incident, with a sold-out concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. He tears up before the set and tells the crowd, ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love."" A meet-and-greet that was scheduled for the show is canceled, with security concerns cited.

Feb. 4: Chicago police release the initial incident report. It says a friend of Smollett, who reported the incident to police, says Smollett ""did not want to report offense"" but ""believed it to be in the best interest to."" The report also notes that Smollett still had a rope around his neck when police arrived to interview him. In the report, Smollett says the attackers were wearing black and the ""primary aggressor."" He says they were wearing a black mask, but he recalls no other ""distinguishing features.""

Feb. 12: Chicago police say the phone records Smollett gave them were ""heavily redacted"" and ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.""

Feb. 14: Smollett appears on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" for his first television interview since the incident. He tears up in the interview and pushes back on those who have questioned his story. He says ""pride"" made him reluctant to initially report the incident, and that he was hesitant to give his phone to police because of private information on it.

In a statement, Smollett's lawyer say the redactions were ""intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.""

Chicago police say media reports about the attack being a hoax ""are unconfirmed by case detectives. Smollett denies the reports through a spokesperson. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says there is no evidence to support that this was a hoax.

Feb. 15: Chicago police announce they are questioning two ""persons of interest"" who were seen on surveillance video. But later that day, the two men are released without charges. Police say ""new evidence"" has given detectives ""additional investigative work to complete.""

Feb. 16: A source close to the investigation tells CBS News that two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the attack. They say the rope that was found around Smollett's neck was purchased at a nearby hardware store. A raid of their home turned up ropes, masks and bleach.

Chicago police say their questioning of the brothers had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" and they requested another interview with Smollett. The actor's attorneys say he is ""angered and devastated"" by reports that he knew the alleged attackers, and that one of the men was Smollett's personal trainer. Ola Osundairo had played a prisoner in a season of ""Empire.""

Feb. 17: Chicago police release a vague statement on Twitter: ""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""

Feb. 18: Ola and Abel Osundairo, the two brothers previously questioned by police, speak out publicly for the first time. In a statement to CBS Chicago, the brothers say: ""We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.""

Feb. 19: The two brothers were talking to prosecutors, sources told CBS News. The brothers spent the afternoon at the Cook County courthouse. It is not clear if they testified, but they are expected to, according to sources. That could lead to an indictment of Smollett.

Feb. 20: The Cook County, Illinois, state attorney files a felony disorderly conduct charge against Smollett for allegedly filing a false report. This is announced soon after Chicago police confirm Smollett is a suspect in a criminal investigation.

Surveillance footage obtained by CBS Chicago shows the Osundairo brothers buying a red hat and ski masks one day before the reported assault.

Feb. 21: Chicago police say Smollett turned himself in to face charge. A judge sets bond at $100,000 and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson blasts Smollett at a press conference, saying he is ""offended"" and ""angry"" by the apparent hoax.

""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" Johnson says. ""Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?""

March 8: A Chicago grand jury charges Smollett with 16 felony counts for every alleged lie he told police.

March 14: Smollett pleads not guilty.

March 26: The Cook County State's Attorney Office announces that all charges against Smollett are dropped and his record will be wiped. The office says Smollett forfeited his $10,000 bond payment and did two days of community service. In a brief statement to the press, Smollett says he has ""been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.""

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson express fury over the decision and say they stand by the accusations against Smollett. Emanuel calls the move a ""whitewash of justice"" and implies Smollett's fame helped him get off.

March 27: State prosecutor Joe Magats, who made the decision to drop the charges, tells CBS News he still believes Smollett is guilty. He says his office needs to focus on violent crimes, and that he feels Smollett had done enough to ""wipe this clean.""

Chicago police release a batch of documents from the investigation. The files cast doubt on Smollett's claim that he gave the Osundairo brothers a $3,500 check for fitness training, rather than as payment for the faked assault.

Prosecutor says he believes Jussie Smollett is guilty, despite dropping all charges

March 28: A lawyer for the city of Chicago says the city is seeking $130,000 from actor Jussie Smollett as restitution for the cost of the investigation he initiated. Hours earlier, President Trump tweeted the FBI and the Department of Justice would review the ""outrageous"" case, calling it an ""embarrassment"" to the country. Also, Smollett has been nominated for an NAACP Image Award, which will be handed out Saturday in Hollywood. It is unclear if he will be in attendance."

“Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago police said in a statement at the time.

Eight days before the attack, a letter was allegedly posted to Fox Studios in Chicago with cut out letters spelling, “you will die black fag.”

As police continued their investigations, Smollett’s Empire colleagues were given armed security.

Smollett’s family were heartbroken.

“Our beloved son and brother Smollett was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack, we want it to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime,” they told the media.

President Trump even weighed in, calling the assault “horrible” when asked about it in a press interview.

Smollett himself also addressed the attack, releasing a statement.

“These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” he said.

Just a day after the attack, police released surveillance images of two persons of interest captured on camera around the time of the alleged attack.

Days later, at Chicago’s O’Hare International airport two men – Nigerian brothers Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo – were arrested.

But over the weekend they were released without charge."

Multiple news publications reported late on Saturday that law enforcement officials said they believed that Smollett had paid two Nigerian brothers to conduct the attack.

In response to the recent developments, Trump Jr. rattled off a series of tweets going after Smollett and the media for promoting the story.

“Shocked, I really thought MAGA folks (who are all over downtown Chicago) were waiting with a rope/bottle of bleach to ambush a righ guy at 2am in minus 4 degrees because those are conditions where all people go out for Subway rather than order Seamless,” Trump Jr. tweeted. “Seemed so real.”

TMZ reported on Sunday that, according to law enforcement sources connected to the investigation, “a grand jury will hear the Jussie Smollett case early next week.”

TMZ added that “the 2 brothers who were arrested and then released are staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them. We’re told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony said on Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Lawyers representing Smollett responded to the new allegations against their client in a statement the released late on Saturday night.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement from Smollett’s lawyers said. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorney’s anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” the statement concluded. “At present time, Jussie and his attorney’s have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”"

As the New York Post’s Page Six noted, a Chicago grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the controversial attack that has since been labeled an alleged hoax concocted by the actor and his friends. The panel is expected to hear the case starting in the coming week, though it was not clear when any indictments may be issued.

The Empire actor claimed in January that he was attacked late at night while walking on a Chicago street by two masked men who beat him and placed a noose around his neck. Smollett claimed that the men yelled, “This is MAGA country,” in reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, then poured a chemical on him.

But doubts soon began to rise around the report, with police tracking down two men seen on surveillance video near Smollett and later identifying them as friends of the actor. As Deadline reported, Chicago police announced this weekend that the investigation had shifted and are now looking at Smollett as a suspect.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told the news outlet.

TMZ also reported that Smollett paid a pair of Nigerian brothers $3,500 to attack him, and reports indicated that they rehearsed the attack beforehand. Smollett himself could now be facing charges. In a separate story, law enforcement sources told TMZ that the case was going before a grand jury, though the source was not able to say who was the target of the investigation.

Police are reportedly investigating whether a threatening letter sent to the actor was also part of the hoax. As police were searching the homes of the two brothers who allegedly helped plan the attack, they found magazine pages that had letters cut out, which could have been used to create the threatening letter that used racial and homophobic slurs toward the actor.

TMZ reported that police suspicions grew around the attack, with officers noting that it seemed odd that a Trump supporter would be in that part of Chicago — and would refer to it as “MAGA country.”

Smollett has continued to deny any allegations that the attack was a hoax or that he participated in its planning."

Last month, the “Empire” actor recounted a hard-to-believe hate crime alleging he was attacked by two white men on a city street in Chicago at 2 a.m. The black actor claimed the white men assaulted him, put a rope around his neck and threw bleach on him while hurling racist and homophobic epithets — and saying “This is MAGA country.”

Instead of waiting for the police to investigate the wild tale, many in the media, top Democratic lawmakers and 2020 presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, wasted no time rushing to his defense. Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both compared the alleged attack to a “modern-day lynching,” while Bernie Sanders called it “a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.” House Majority Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ex-Vice President Joe Biden and other Dems jumped in the fray, fanning racial divisions while others fueled the false narrative that Trump supporters are anti-LGBTQ. Not surprisingly, Hollywood liberals rushed to defend the actor while trying to blame the purported hate crime on “Trump’s rhetoric.”

Now evidence strongly suggests the whole thing was a hoax.

Video surveillance obtained by police show the attackers were black — not white, as we were initially told. Two Nigerians brothers who had been questioned by police as possible “assailants” are friends with Smollett and authorities are now investigating if the actor orchestrated the hate crime — a stage 4 felony. Reports have also surfaced suggesting Smollett may have rehearsed the “attack” and paid his anti-Trump buddies thousands of dollars to commit the assault upon himself.

This isn’t the first time reckless Democrats and knee-jerk media swallowed allegations wholesale that make Republicans look bad without first vetting the information.

They did it to poor Brett Kavanaugh, believing his female accusers’ outlandish stories of alleged sexual assault from decades ago without corroborating evidence. Those allegations were later rebuked or debunked.

And who can forget the left’s recent ambush against the Covington High School boys? Liberals and fake news media were quick to paint the students as “racists” simply because they’re white, straight and male who committed the ultimate sin — smiling while wearing MAGA hats — on a school trip to DC.

The teenagers were bullied and defamed en masse before evidence emerged proving they did nothing wrong. The pattern of these false accusations show Democrats cannot be trusted to hold positions of power, as they have a history of tossing due process out the window along with the presumption of innocence anytime there’s an opportunity to fuel a political narrative.

I dare anyone to find a fair-minded voter who’s impressed.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs.

Numerous celebrities immediately spoke out in support of the ""Empire"" actor. After published reports emerged saying that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack, they said they would reserve judgment until they had more information.

Conservative pundits including Dinesh D'Souza and Tomi Lahren have seized on the doubts that have been raised. They criticized people for using social media after the attack to push a narrative that President Donald Trump's supporters are racist and homophobic.

Not only did the Rangers earn the top seed in Class A South with an 18-0 record – extending their winning streak to 34 – but also defeated South Portland (No. 1 in Class AA South), Oxford Hills (No. 1 in Class AA North) and Gray-New Gloucester (No. 1 in Class B South) twice.

And now Greely, the defending Class A state champion, might even be better. With the Class A South quarterfinals starting Monday, the Rangers are finally healthy. Junior guard Brooke Obar, who missed 10 games with an ankle injury, returned late in the regular season, joining senior guard Anna DeWolfe and sophomore guard Camille Clement to form a potent offensive trio.

“They’re back to being a three-headed monster,” said Sam Farrell, coach of second-ranked Brunswick (17-1), which lost to Greely without Obar, 67-46 on Dec. 28.

Obar, said Greely Coach Todd Flaherty, “makes us a lot harder to guard … I think our offense struggled at times without her decision-making on the floor. Then on defense she can guard anyone. She gives us a lot of flexibility.”

The South girls’ basketball tournaments get into full swing this week, with Class A quarterfinals Monday at the Portland Expo, Class B quarterfinals Tuesday at the Portland Expo, Class C quarterfinals Tuesday at the Augusta Civic Center and Class AA semifinals Tuesday (South) and Wednesday (North) at the Cross Insurance Arena.

Greely’s quarterfinal is at 7:30 p.m. Monday against No. 8 Fryeburg.

Brunswick is led by senior guard Charlotte MacMillan, who averaged a team-high 14 points. But she has plenty of help in seniors Marley Groat, Emily Larochelle and Rosalie White, and freshman Logan Brown.

Third-ranked Marshwood’s quarterfinal is against neighboring York and pits York Coach Steve Freeman against his son, Marshwood Coach Steve Freeman. The Hawks beat York twice in the regular season.

“I’ve got to make sure we have the right mindset going in,” said Marshwood’s Steve Freeman. “They need to understand that York can beat us. Because they can.”

In Class B, Gray-New Gloucester (16-2) certainly looms as the favorite – its only losses were to Greely – but Coach Mike Andreasen is having none of that. “Those wins mean nothing to us,” he said. “Other then what color uniforms you wear and where you sit on the court.”

The Patriots, with everyone back from last year’s team that lost in a regional semifinal, play pretty good defense, giving up an average of 27.4 points a game.

While Bri Jordan and Jordan Grant are their top two players, Mikaela Ryan and Eliza Hotham each have provided solid contributions. “Teams now have to contend with all our parts,” said Andreasen.

Yarmouth (12-6) had a seven-win improvement over last year to secure the fourth seed in Class B. “Give the credit to the girls,” said first-year coach David Cousins. “They worked very hard and deserve to get where they are.”

In Class C, North Yarmouth Academy (14-4) is the third seed, its only losses to Yarmouth, Gray-New Gloucester and Greely (twice). The Panthers, who play Monmouth Academy at 10 a.m. Tuesday in Augusta, have a balanced offense, led by guard Catherine Reid, making them difficult to defend. “We’re blessed with a lot of options,” said first-year coach Tom Robinson.

The Class AA South semifinals feature the same four team as last year – South Portland, Scarborough, Gorham and Bonny Eagle.

Gorham beat South Portland and Scarborough to advance to the state final for a third consecutive year last season. The Rams (13-6) are finally healthy for their game against the Red Storm, with guards Brittany Desjardins and Olivia Michaud back after injuries. “We’re healthy, moving the ball better than we have and the kids are playing with more confidence,” said Coach Laughn Berthiaume. “All things are positive.”

Gorham also has senior center Mackenzie Holmes, who has 1,721 career points, 1,010 career rebounds and 361 career blocked shots.

South Portland (18-1) will take on a Bonny Eagle team that has won 11 of its last 13. Coach Lynne Hasson said the playoff disappointments of the last couple of years have strengthened this club. “We’ve got a little unfinished business,” she said. “The kids have worked their butts off this year.”

Seventh-seeded Deering made it to the Class AA North semifinals and will face No. 3 Bangor (12-7) at 2 p.m. Wednesday. The Rams (5-14) have been a different team since the return of standout guard Delaney Haines, winning four of the six games she played. Fourth-ranked Portland (10-9) ended Edward Little’s AA state title reign in the quarterfinals and will take on No. 1 Oxford Hills (17-2) at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The national outrage that simmered after actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked by people shouting racial and anti-gay slurs was fueled in part by celebrities who spoke out loud and strong on social media.

But the outrage has now been replaced by surprise, doubt and bafflement as the singers, actors and politicians who came out in support of the “Empire” star struggle to digest the strange twists the case has taken. Some conservative pundits, meanwhile, have gleefully seized on the moment.

The narrative that just a week ago seemed cut-and-dry has become messy and divisive — and it’s all playing out again on social media.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!”— a reference to the Make America Great Again slogan used in President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Smollett said the attackers looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Zendaya, Kerry Washington, Shonda Rhimes and Andy Cohen rallied behind Smollett immediately. They focused on the alleged hate crime as a microcosm for the ills of America in 2019 and how intolerance can lead to violent acts. Smollett’s own celebrity and activism for the rights of the LGBTQ community helped raise the profile of the case even more.

But then published reports emerged that police believe Smollett may have staged the attack — something the actor has vehemently denied through his lawyers — or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unidentified police sources.

On Saturday, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the trajectory of the case had “shifted” — that two brothers who had been questioned had been released without charges and investigators wanted to speak to Smollett again . Guglielmi did not elaborate. On Sunday, he issued a statement saying that police “are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Saturday that he would continue to cooperate with police but that he felt victimized by the suggestion he played a role in his attack.

Skeptics, including conservative pundits Dinesh D’Souza and Tomi Lahren, seized on the doubts that have arisen.

“And Libs wonder why we don’t believe their BS stories,” Lahren tweeted Saturday. On Sunday, she criticized those who used social media after the attack to push “the narrative (that) Trump supporters are racist homophobes.”

The response from Smollett’s celebrity supporters has ranged from silence to confusion and disbelief.

Author Roxane Gay tweeted Saturday that she doesn’t know what to say, but that the situation is a “mess” and a “travesty.”

“I genuinely thought no one, and especially no one that famous, could make something like that up,” Gay wrote. “The lie is so damaging. The time the CPD has spent/wasted on this. The people who supported him.”

GLAAD, a nongovernmental media-monitoring organization founded by LGBT members of the media, on Thursday reiterated its support for Smollett. The group said in a statement that the actor had been doubly victimized: first by the attack and then by the doubts cast around it.

When Smollett first reported that he was assaulted, Democratic New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” On Sunday, he said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay said she is waiting for more information too. She tweeted on Sunday that she “can’t blindly believe” the Chicago Police Department.

But if there is a consensus among those who very vocally supported Smollett from the outset, it’s that no matter what happens in this case, they will still believe victims.

DuVernay said: “Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

Gay echoed her sentiments, tweeting that she does not regret believing Smollett.

“I’m not going to stop believing people who say they have suffered,” Gay wrote. “Because more often than not they are telling the truth.”

But just because Simon Roussel cannot be jumping for the Gorham High track team hardly means he’s idle.

Roussel, 17, a senior, is busy with his music and studies. He performs in both the Portland Youth Wind Ensemble (PYWE) and Portland Youth Symphony Orchestra (PYSO), as well as district and all-state bands. Academically, Roussel is a National Merit Finalist with a challenging load of classes.

Related Headlines Varsity Maine Honor Roll for Feb. 17

Adding to his schedule, Roussel made a last-minute decision to audition for the school musical, Cinderella, and was cast in the male lead. His sixth and final performance was last week.

Roussel is waiting for a strained calf muscle to recover so he can resume jumping again for the Rams’ track and field team. He qualified for the Class A outdoor track and field state meet last season and hopes to do the same this year.

Q: How did the indoor track season go?

A: I was only able to compete in two meets. I jumped 18-2 in long jump and 37 feet in the triple jump, which wasn’t that great. I think I qualified for states (in the triple jump) … But then (on Jan. 24) I strained my calf. I thought I felt something pop, so (a strain) is good news. I don’t know how long I’m out.

Q: Before you got hurt, your schedule seemed impossible. How is your time management?

A: It’s passable. I just kind have so many things to keep track of, I don’t bother keeping track … I just kind of like ‘do this now, then the next, and next.’ Just take it one step at a time. That’s the way it stresses me out the least. Kind of weird but it works. It’s been kind of crazy this year with indoor (track) and the musical. I’m the jumping captain so I was going to as many practices as possible. Sometimes I’d be late for rehearsal.

Q: When do you play your trumpet?

A: I only have rehearsal with PYWE and PYSO on Wednesday nights, although it’s 5:45 to 9 p.m. We have a concert in April … The district honor band festival was Jan. 19. The state band performance is in May. We rehearse for that on our own.

Q: And your studies?

A: I really only have lots of homework for Latin (IV) and AP Literature. (Roussel also takes Advanced Chemistry II, Advanced Financial Algebra, TV production, AP Music theory, and Band). That’s not as bad as last year.

Q: What was last year?

A: It was a nightmare. I started off my day with AP Language and composition, and then calculus at (the University of Southern Maine). Then Advanced Chemistry I, AP Physics, World History II, Latin 3, concert band, jazz band and chamber singing.

Q: When did you get involved in sports?

A: I played (youth) baseball. In sixth grade I ran cross country, indoor and outdoor track … I did running events and did pretty well. In eighth grade, in outdoor, I started high jumping. I got hooked on it. I watched videos of Olympic high jumping and videos on form every night. Practiced it every chance I could. That year I did summer track and was able to do high jump, long jump and triple jump. I cleared 5-5 in a meet. I was real excited for indoor my freshman year. First two meets were pretty good. I cleared 5-4. I thought ‘yes, this is going to be a good season,’ and then I hurt my back.”

Q: What happened?

A: My legs were tired all the time and I had stabbing pains in my back. I pushed through the issues the rest of my freshman year, but my jumping performance decreased … It wasn’t until a year later we actually found out what was wrong. A bone scan showed I had a slight disc herniation in my lower back, as well as a congenital disorder. My options were cortisone injections, super-invasive surgery or a back brace that I had to wear for 12 weeks. I chose the brace. It was my sophomore year and indoor (track) had started. I couldn’t do anything for the first six weeks. Six weeks of nothing.”

Q: How do you handle nothing?

A: I kind of went a little crazy. I definitely channeled some of that into playing my trumpet more and singing more (with the chamber singers).

Q: When did you start playing the trumpet?

A: In fifth grade they had people come in and demonstrate all the instruments. It was boring. Then this guy started playing the trumpet. He was playing the Indiana Jones theme and it was this glorious, exciting trumpet sound. I’m like ‘I want that.’ Kind of a love-at-first-sight deal.

Q: Back to track. When did you return from the back injury?

A: The outdoor season my sophomore year, I could only do running; no jumps. They said I shouldn’t high jump again, which made me sad. I really, really loved high jump. Junior year, indoor, I did mostly running and began incorporating jumps into practice. In outdoor, my long jump was OK. In the triple jump I jumped 38-9.5 my first meet and qualified for states. But then I got shin splints after that. I competed in states but I didn’t do my best.

Q: Speaking of doing your best, how was Cinderella? This was your first musical, right?

A: It’s something I always wanted to do but I was scared to do it … I have singing experience. I’m pretty comfortable with that. It’s the acting that makes me nervous.

Q: The calf strain might be better soon. Think you will be OK for outdoor track?

A: That’s the goal (Roussel is laughing). I just want one, full healthy season.

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the “Empire” actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement the lawyers say: “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.

Chicago police Saturday said their investigation of the attack had “shifted” following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released from police custody Friday without being charged.

Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men was the actor’s personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys also said in their statement that Smollett felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Is it too much to ask CNN to bring an ounce of critical evidence to claims - especially on highly socially divisive topics such as a heinous hate crime - instead of closing their eyes and parroting whatever is the story line du jour merely because of politically convenient narratives?

How many embarrassing retractions, walk-backs, corrections, and deleted articles will it take?

Instead we once again see CNN and virtually all other left-leaning mainstream outlets spreading legitimately fake news like wild-fire merely because a given narrative is politically and ideologically convenient to their corporate owners, because you know... MAGA.

The mere mention of ""White men in MAGA hats"" immediately crushes the mainstream's ability for critical analysis, as many recent instances of embarrassing media mea culpas prove. And they are becoming too many to count of late. As it now turns out, Donald Trump Jr. is correct in pointing out that:

It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.

As Fox News' Brian Flood also remarks, ""CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news... but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters.""

I wonder why CNN keeps forgetting the Trump Supporters part? They REALLY LOVED that part when the story first broke!!! 🤔 https://t.co/ITTO4dhjs8 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2019

Indeed see for yourself CNN's initial wall-to-wall reporting of the now confirmed fake “this is MAGA country” supposedly racial and homophobic attack.

As the story unraveled and as police began to prove it was obviously all a hoax, CNN went full-bore in the other direction, finally turning against the Empire star, with a panel of guests denouncing what what many suspected all along — that Smollett staged a hate crime hoax.

And yet, CNN and other networks while attempting a collective mea culpa have still manage to blame Trump and his supporters. The Daily Caller's Chuck Ross notes that even amidst the embarrassing fallout, ""Every single NYT, WaPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, etc. reporter who has commented on this topic has defended the dear journalists"" — as in the ones who got the facts wildly wrong in the first place.

Predictable take from a Vox writer. @feministabulous says not one negative word about Smollett, but instead launches straight into diatribe about Trump-induced hate crimes and a defense of media coverage of Smollett case. pic.twitter.com/urTi9jDyAL — Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) February 17, 2019

Vox's Liz Plank's hot take on the ""This is MAGA country"" quote repeatedly featured and spread by the mainstream is that it was driven by ""good intentions"". Plank had the gall to say while appearing on a CNN Sunday:

The people who were repeating that quote were not news outlets...It was repeated by, sure, people who maybe had good intentions of wanting to spread the story...We can't confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.

But CNN and the rest of the mainstream falling in line lockstep behind fake reporting is nothing new. So perhaps a trip down recent history memory lane is in order...

Remember this from last year? A video circulated of all the broadcasters saying the exact same thing based on Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation's largest owner of local television stations, scripting the news for all its affiliates.

Also crucial to recall is the same drumbeat of the past two years:

""The beginning of the end of the Trump presidency...""

""The tipping point...""

""The walls are closing in...""

""Trump's going down...""

""He will not serve out his term...""

And guess what? There's often real life consequences of fake news for those not sheltered within the cozy offices of mainstream media corporate high rises.

Maybe it's time for the major networks to collectively take a long (many might prefer permanent) pause, maybe a lengthy vacation for some much needed reflection and introspection?

Yes CNN, the walls are closing in... on the mainstream media.

Meanwhile perhaps it's time for CNN's ""media janitor"", Brian Stelter, who is oh so quick to point out the bias in every other network except his own, tackle the most difficult and embarrassing question: why were the mainstream - and fringe - journalists who were skeptical of Smollett's claims, attacked and forced to self-censor when the case was unfolding, and will continue to self-censor knowing that if they criticize Smollett directly they would be accused of homophobia and racism?"

The man has no doubt ruined his reputation and very possibly his career. While he told Robin Roberts in a widely publicized Good Morning America interview that he “come[s] really, really hard against 45” (meaning Trump), his motive for potentially stirring up a battle over race and sexual identity (just check out the threads on Twitter of those supporting his lie without the benefit of fact) makes very little sense. Particularly because, by some early accounts, he staged the attack because he believed he was going to be written off his hit show. (The network denied that almost immediately.)

Are we to believe Smollett took the risk of ruination, paying by some accounts several thousand to the fake attackers, simply because he dislikes the Trump administration that intensely, but then was unwilling to admit to that hatred? He’s been pretty open about his feelings on the Trump admin, so why not just use that as the reason? It was just so important to bring light to the awfulness of the administration that desperate measures had to be taken, or something like that. It’s absurd, but at least it’s consistent.

He’s of course still denying he played a part in orchestrating the attack, so perhaps we just aren’t there yet. But the motive for the trickery remains elusive, and will likely end up being the most critical part of the whole story (if we ever get the benefit of hearing it).

Until that story is finally told, one man thinks he might understand at least how the social condition of the country was ripe for this kind of hoax — and why Smollett may not have thought he was taking much of a risk.

Freelance journalist Andy Ngo, a gay man himself who did tremendous work covering the Resist rallies that took place last year in the Pacific Northwest, spoke with Ben Shapiro about what he thinks may have motivated Smollett, and it’s an indictment of a culture prone to panic, fed by a media seeking sensational ledes.

Now that it is finally known that @JussieSmollett is being investigated for paying the Nigerian men to orchestrate the hate attack blamed on Trump supporters, expect lots of people to ask “what would drive someone to do this?” Here’s why (click to listen): pic.twitter.com/82Kn2pk5vi — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 17, 2019

“It really illustrates how sick our society is…we’ve come to a place where we really worship victimhood and place more value in it than being heroic, or charitable, or kind,” Ngo said. “And as somebody who happens to be gay, I particularly resent that minorities are being encouraged to be fragile and bitter. I think this country is in the middle of a race panic.”

That panic is exacerbated by legislators and talking news heads who were quick to smear all Trump supporters as racists. Ngo has a handy list of them starting here:

Leaks out of the Chicago PD say that investigators believe @JussieSmollett staged the hoax hate attack with two African men connected to “Empire.” Whatever the end results show, I’d like to chronicle some of the responses at the time the news broke of the alleged brutal attack. — Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) February 15, 2019

Oh, and of course celebrities, too.

What’s worse? Even after the story began falling apart, some went so far as to suggest that Smollett’s lie didn’t matter because Trump supporters are racists anyway. Or something. And there’s been very little in the way of apologies from people who blamed an entire group of people for one man’s twisted victim tale.

But the worse yet, of course, is that actual victims are the ones who will suffer for Smollett’s attack on the social fabric of the country. Trump supporters will be fine. But the next person who is maligned or attacked because they’re a minority — women, LGBTQ, race and religious minorities — may find that people will take longer to believe them even if they’re telling the truth. And that’s the real tragedy of this.

So Jussie, why’d ya do it? Because those people deserve an explanation."

Commentator Kmele Foster, host of The Fifth Column podcast, was the first to weigh in after Stelter introduced the segment. Foster, who is black, addressed the topic of the segment, which was whether the media was irresponsible or rushed to judgment in their response to the alleged racially-motivated and homophobic attack on black gay actor Smollett.

“I think there were a lot of reasons for skepticism from early on,” he said. “If this had happened in the way that it was described, it would have been extraordinary, and what we’re seeing now, however, as the story starts to degrade a bit is I do think a lot of frustration on many sides, and even some cheering on other because there was a lot of rush to judgment. I mean, I think a lot — ”

Stelter asked him who was rushing to judgment, and Foster referred to the media, stating a lack of skepticism and urging reporters exhibit “patience”.

That’s when Stelter turned to Vox podcaster Liz Plank, who had a different take, disputing the idea that the media jumped the gun. She said it wasn’t the media who jumped in early, but celebrities and activists. This is demonstrably false (see below), but led to her point about hate crimes overall.

“We don’t know what happened to Jussie, but what we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country, homophobia is alive and well in this country, 2017 set a record for the number of hate crimes,” said Plank. “The president and his rhetoric has been cited by people who — there is real evidence of people who have done these crimes that cite that the president has inspired them.”

Foster began to say that what people believe might be part of the problem, and Plank turned toward him and snapped “Yeah, that’s because it’s a trend.”

“Well I think this is part of the problem, we’re establishing the trend, whether or not it’s there,” said Foster, referring to Plank’s linkage of Trump’s rise to a rise in hate crimes.

The back and forth continued, with Foster continuing to state his position as Plank became increasingly agitated, fake laughing as she aggressively contradicted him.

“A hate crime is not the sort of thing we simply look at and it is absolutely, positively a hate crime. There’s some supposition about that,” said Foster at one point, to which Plank replied with more mocking laughter.

“So you don’t believe the FBI? The FBI isn’t an expert? You’re an expert?” Plank derisively spat.

Here’s a trimmed version of the clip.



Plank was citing real statistics, although as Foster noted, correlation is not necessarily causation. And derision is not argumentation, although it is argumentative. But her assertion about increase in hate crimes was correct.

On the subject of the media jumping the gun, however, Plank was dead wrong. It wasn’t just activists and celebrities, there were countless members of the press, on the day of the TMZ story, who did indeed run with the story to draw conclusions, and who took and repeated the MAGA angle.

“The MAGA quote, I remember reading about this story, and looking for a real reputable media outlet reporting on it, and I couldn’t find one,” she said. “We can’t confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.”

There is no way to know what exactly the Vox podcaster means by “reputable” but Vibe Magazine reported it on that day.

There was also Slate, Sirius XM, Orlando Sun-Sentinel. Many outlets, particularly local network affiliates, included the MAGA angle, often with the “reports TMZ” caveat. Plank said she couldn’t find a single one. There were dozens more from individual reporters, journalists, and members of the press. Even from among CNN’s ranks. There were many, many more. It’s simply not correct to say the MAGA angle of the story was not shared by mainstream press following TMZ’s initial report.

The arguing continued in the segment until Brian Stelter stepped in and said, “if he lied, he’s hurt real victims of hate crimes,” to which all the panelists agreed, but disagreement continued right after and until the end of the segment.

Democratic presidential candidates spent Sunday courting voters in states with influential early roles in the 2020 primary, their busy pace of holiday weekend campaigning demonstrating that the contest to challenge President Donald Trump is fully underway.

The weeklong congressional recess for Presidents Day gives senators already running for president some extra time to promote their agendas, and all were taking advantage by visiting at least one of four pivotal early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey set the briskest pace Sunday, meeting supporters in Rochester and Manchester, New Hampshire. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also was campaigning in the Granite State, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California was due there on Monday.

In the Midwest, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar visited Iowa. Farther west, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren campaigned in Nevada, the first Western state to vote in the 2020 presidential primary.

Highlights from the trail:

CORY BOOKER

The New Jersey Democrat told reporters he is reserving judgment after new reports about the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. When Smollett initially reported that he was attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs, Booker called the incident a ""modern-day lynching.""

In Chicago over the weekend, police said their investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault and would continue to co-operate with police.

In remarks in Rochester, New Hampshire, Booker urged a broader fight against hate crimes and called for a unified pushback against ""attacks on people because they're different.""

Later, amid music from old and new video games, the ringing of pinball machines and the sound of cans of domestic and craft beers cracking open, Booker talked policy at a ""barcade"" in Manchester.

""I have done events in basements, I have done house parties, I have done union halls,"" Booker said as he surveyed the colorful arcade cabinets lined up behind him, including Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat. ""I have never done a barcade.""

That didn't stop Booker from trying his hand at a number of games, including a newer, four-player Pac-Man game, and a vintage game — Q(asterisk)bert— after taking questions for a half-hour.

Reflecting on the nostalgia, Booker said he saw his childhood ""beckoning him back"" and that he would challenge ""anybody in the Senate to any of these games.""

ELIZABETH WARREN

In her visit to Nevada as a presidential candidate, the Massachusetts senator described a squeeze on working families and a political system that she says fails to protect homeowners, including the residents of Las Vegas who were pummeled by the mortgage crisis a decade ago.

Warren spoke about her work as a consumer activist and her role overseeing the bailout of banks and insurers a decade ago, a job that brought her to Las Vegas to hear from residents struggling to keep their homes.

""You better believe one reason that I am in this fight is we can never let this happen again. Never,"" she told about 500 people at a botanical garden and event centre northeast of the Las Vegas Strip.

Nevada's early presidential caucus is the first in the West and is seen as a key test of a candidate's ability to appeal to a state with powerful labour groups and diverse demographics, including a population that's about 29 per cent Latino.

In her speech, Warren condemned predatory mortgages targeted to minorities and said income inequality disproportionately affects communities of colour. She also said unions need strengthening and that the country needs comprehensive immigration reform.

WILLIAM WELD

The first Republican to move toward a primary challenge against President Donald Trump said he plans to campaign on what he calls Trump's reckless spending and lack of preparation in helping workers shift to jobs in a more automated economy.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who announced on Friday that he was forming an exploratory committee for president, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Trump is racking up $1 trillion a year in debt that will crush taxpayers.

Weld said the government should be preparing workers to shift to jobs in ""artificial intelligence and robotics and drones and machine learning and autonomous vehicles.""

But Weld added that policymakers aren't paying attention to that because ""they're so busy with divisiveness and trying to make everyone feel awful.""

Theo Wargo/Getty Images(CHICAGO) — The two brothers who were interrogated by police investigating the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago told authorities that the “Empire” actor allegedly paid them to help him orchestrate and stage the crime, sources told ABC News Sunday.

Detectives are trying to corroborate the account of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, but thus far police have not independently verified the allegations, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told ABC News.

The Osundairo brothers agreed to cooperate with authorities after detectives confronted them with evidence that they bought the rope — allegedly used in an attack that Smollett described to police as laced with racial and homophobic slurs — at a Chicago hardware store, sources said.

No one has been charged in connection with the case.

Detectives have now shifted the investigation towards determining whether Smollett made up the entire story, sources said.

The latest twist in the investigation came after Smollett hit back at the suggestion that the incident was a hoax, and expressed disbelief that the brothers could have been involved.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

The attorneys said that Smollett has been cooperating with the police throughout the investigation.

After initially being considered persons of interest, the Osundairo brothers were detained and became potential suspects, police said. When they were threatened with battery and hate crimes charges, they agreed to work with detectives, sources told ABC News.

The dramatic shift in the probe is the latest in the fast-changing story that started with Smollett reporting to police that he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29.

While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident. pic.twitter.com/b9GgXbSUt9 — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) February 17, 2019

By Saturday evening, however, Chicago police said they were “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” after the interrogation of the Osundairo brothers, who police said are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent.

“We have been in touch with Smollett’s attorneys,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told ABC News Sunday afternoon, adding that investigators “are waiting on whether they’re going to get a response from his attorney.”

Guglielmi said the department contacted the actor’s lawyers Friday night.

“We made our intentions clear,” he said.

On Sunday afternoon, Guglielmi posted a statement on Twitter, saying, “While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.”

A spokesperson for Fox, which broadcasts “Empire,” declined comment on Saturday night.

Early Saturday, after the brothers were released, police said they had new information that “could change the story entirely.”

Police confirmed that Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were the two men seen in surveillance images from the night of the alleged incident. They were taken into custody on Wednesday night and interviewed by detectives in the following days.

Based on the video evidence that police discovered, it did not indicate anyone else was there at the scene of the alleged incident, police said.

But on Saturday, after their release the night before, police said the brothers were no longer potential suspects and again persons of interest, saying that they may still have information that is helpful to the investigation.

Smollett told police that on Jan. 29, he was walking on a street near his apartment when he was attacked by two men. The attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs before hitting him, pouring “an unknown chemical substance” on him — possibly bleach — and wrapping a rope around his neck, he told detectives.

Police confirmed phone records show that during the attack, Smollett was on the phone with Brandon Moore, his music manager. Both claimed that the alleged attackers yelled “MAGA country.”

While Guglielmi said on Saturday that he could not speak on what the new information was, he said that detectives had “shifted the trajectory” of the investigation. Though he did not say whether Smollett spoke to the men that night — one of them had previously appeared on “Empire” — he said it will also be central to the investigation whether they spoke to or saw Smollett.

Police raided the home of the Osundairo brothers Wednesday night to search for possible evidence and retrieved shoes, electronic devices, bleach and a red hat, among other items, according to photos of an inventory log confirmed to ABC News. The inventory log, first reported by a local CBS station, also contained a description for an item that said “Script-Empire.”

It’s unclear whether forensic results have come back on any of the seized items on the inventory log.

Attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Dolly Parton stopped by the Savoy Theatre on Sunday for the evening gala for 9-5: The Musical in London.

And she was joined by another Queen, Kylie Minogue, as they posed for pictures.

The Can’t Get You Out Of My Head hitmaker looked in awe to be around the country singing legend at the venue for the musical based on the 1980 movie of the same.

The 73-year-old who famously sand the lyrics ‘working 9 -5’ worked all of her angles as she smiled for the paparazzi.

The original movie starred Dolly, alongside Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as three working women who lived out their fantasies of getting even with their misogynistic boss.

The musical remake is filled with remakes of Dolly’s greatest hits.

As well as Kylie and Dolly, the evening was also attended by a whole host of other famous faces including Beauty and the Beast star Luke Evans and Love Island stars Samira Mighty and Olivia Attwood.

The musical also stars Amber Davies, who appeared on the ITV dating show in 2017 and Louise Redknapp.

Louise, who plays the role of Violet Newstead in the show suffering a nasty fall in the street on the way to rehearsals and had no choice but to miss the opening weeks of the production.

Actress Caroline Sheen was announced to step into her role of Violet Newstead until March when Louise is allowed to return.

Caroline said she’d be ‘working 24/7’ and not 9-5 to get her part wrapped up by the 28th of this month when she makes her debut.

Updating her fans with her healing progress in January, she took to Instagram writing: ‘Just been to see the doctor, my chin is healing really well but still quite sore.

‘On my way to do a quick read-through for 9-5 so I don’t lose what I had.’

She sent a ‘massive thank you’ to her followers for their ‘amazing’ support but seemed determined to keep up a normal routine while she’s off work.

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” Page told host Stephen Colbert.

Democratic presidential candidates spent Sunday courting voters in states with influential early roles in the 2020 primary, their busy pace of holiday weekend campaigning demonstrating that the contest to challenge President Donald Trump is fully underway.

The weeklong congressional recess for Presidents Day gives senators already running for president some extra time to promote their agendas, and all were taking advantage by visiting at least one of four pivotal early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey set the briskest pace Sunday, meeting supporters in Rochester and Manchester, New Hampshire. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also was campaigning in the Granite State, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California was due there on Monday.

In the Midwest, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar visited Iowa. Farther west, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren campaigned in Nevada, the first Western state to vote in the 2020 presidential primary.

CORY BOOKER

The New Jersey Democrat told reporters he is reserving judgment after new reports about the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett. When Smollett initially reported that he was attacked by two men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs, Booker called the incident a ""modern-day lynching.""

In Chicago over the weekend, police said their investigation had ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault and would continue to co-operate with police.

In remarks in Rochester, New Hampshire, Booker urged a broader fight against hate crimes and called for a unified pushback against ""attacks on people because they're different.""

Later, amid music from old and new video games, the ringing of pinball machines and the sound of cans of domestic and craft beers cracking open, Booker talked policy at a ""barcade"" in Manchester.

""I have done events in basements, I have done house parties, I have done union halls,"" Booker said as he surveyed the colorful arcade cabinets lined up behind him, including Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat. ""I have never done a barcade.""

That didn't stop Booker from trying his hand at a number of games, including a newer, four-player Pac-Man game, and a vintage game — Q(asterisk)bert— after taking questions for a half-hour.

Reflecting on the nostalgia, Booker said he saw his childhood ""beckoning him back"" and that he would challenge ""anybody in the Senate to any of these games.""

ELIZABETH WARREN

In her visit to Nevada as a presidential candidate, the Massachusetts senator described a squeeze on working families and a political system that she says fails to protect homeowners, including the residents of Las Vegas who were pummeled by the mortgage crisis a decade ago.

Warren spoke about her work as a consumer activist and her role overseeing the bailout of banks and insurers a decade ago, a job that brought her to Las Vegas to hear from residents struggling to keep their homes.

The first Republican to move toward a primary challenge against President Donald Trump said he plans to campaign on what he calls Trump's reckless spending and lack of preparation in helping workers shift to jobs in a more automated economy.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who announced on Friday that he was forming an exploratory committee for president, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Trump is racking up $1 trillion a year in debt that will crush taxpayers.

Weld said the government should be preparing workers to shift to jobs in ""artificial intelligence and robotics and drones and machine learning and autonomous vehicles.""

But Weld added that policymakers aren't paying attention to that because ""they're so busy with divisiveness and trying to make everyone feel awful.""

The trajectory of the investigation changed after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area but were unable to find any footage of the attack. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, Calif., saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

In wake of the latest investigative findings, the Chicago Police Department reportedly has reason to believe the Empire actor may have orchestrated his own attack. Now, Donald Trump Jr. is speaking out to defend his father.

According to the Daily Caller, on February 16, Trump Jr. took to Twitter with a statement about Smollett’s attack. He expressed how the allegedly “manufactured” hate crime is a poor representation of his father and those who support him. Trump Jr. went on to detail the turmoil Trump’s supporters faced as a result of challenging Smollett’s claims.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” Trump Jr. wrote.

In response to Trump Jr.’s tweet, Trump supporters flooded the post with their reactions.

The investigative findings of the Nigerian brothers reportedly confirmed that they were in possession of a MAGA hat and had purchased the rope used in Smollett’s attack. The reason for the brothers’ seemingly abrupt flight to Nigeria on the day of the attack has also been questioned.

However, Trump supporters have also noted how bizarre it seems that Nigerians would be supporters of the Republican president. Based on all of the details that have been reported, Trump supporters are convinced Smollett staged his own attack.

Like Trump Jr., tons of Trump supporters have tweeted to criticize Smollett, and it comes as no surprise that many of the tweets are relentless.

The latest reports about Trump Jr.’s sentiments of Smollett’s attack follow a string of reports about the alleged hate crime. Almost immediately after reports surfaced about the attack, the incident sparked a media firestorm. While Smollett’s fans fiercely defended him, Trump’s supporters argued the claims didn’t seem to add up.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Smollett initially claimed two suspects attacked him in the early hours of January 29. Numerous reports detailed his account of what happened. According to the actor and singer, he was approached by a man wearing Trump’s signature red “Make America Great Again” ball cap. Due to the nature of the attacker’s insults, the attack was immediately classified as a hate crime. However, Smollett still maintains his innocence."

Law enforcement sources tell the outlet that the two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who were arrested and subsequently released, are staying in downtown Chicago and are being guarded by the police. This is so they’re unreachable, especially by Smollett.

When the police searched the brothers’ home, they discovered ripped up magazines. Now, investigators are trying to determine if the torn pages are linked to the threatening letter that Smollett received eight days before the purported attack.

TMZ reports that the police asked Smollett if he’d sign complaints against the brothers, and he agreed to. However, when he found out the identities of the men who were in custody that he apparently knew, he said he felt bad for them and decided not to sign.

The authorities believe that the brothers bought the rope used on Smollett’s neck, though there is no surveillance footage at the hardware store to prove it.

According to TMZ, the way the police tracked the brothers was through their movements around Jessie’s apartment building. The two men either left in a cab or Uber, which the cops were able to track. However, on their way home, the men jumped into another vehicle.

But cops became suspicious when Smollett took them to the scene of the crime and pointed out an obscured camera, mentioning he was happy that the attack was caught on video. While cops found that the camera was pointed in the wrong direction, they thought it was odd that he knew where the camera was.

Investigators also didn’t believe the brothers yelled, “This is MAGA country,” because they say “not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.’”

Smollett and his lawyer have denied that the actor may have paid the two brothers who allegedly attacked him to carry out the assault."

One such tool is silence, with some choosing not to verbalize the identity-based oppressions that consistently present themselves. Perhaps that’s why many victims of crimes believed to be motivated by hate don’t disclose the incident, to their friends and families or to law enforcement officials.

This conversation, about the particulars of hate-based violence, is yet again another discussion point as more unconfirmed details emerge about the alleged homophobic and racist attack Jussie Smollett says he faced over two weeks ago, sowing sentiments of deception toward the Empire actor’s account. But no matter what happens in the still-unfolding investigation, we should not allow the circus that this case has become to call into question our moral obligation to believe people who say they are victims.

A 2018 analysis of the federal National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the Carnegie-Knight News21 reporting initiative and published by The Center for Public Integrity, found that more than 2.4 million crimes, whose victims suspect were motivated by hate, were committed across the United States in the five years between 2012 and 2016. But hate crime data from the FBI for the same time period says only 30,000 hate crimes were reported to them by local police, with only 12 percent of the nation’s police departments reporting any hate crimes at all to the FBI. This means that hate-based violence is occuring more often than it’s being reported to, or logged by, local law enforcement.

The documented reasons as to why victims of violence, hate-based or otherwise, are reluctant to report to police, as opposed to disclosing to activist-oriented and social uplift organizations, are vast. For LGBTQ+ people, innumerable examples of a lack of cultural competency (misgendering trans people, personal anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, etc.) by cops engender distrust. For some Latinos and immigrants, they fear reporting incidents to authorities because of their, or their families’, undocumented status or the anti-immigrant climate spurred by Donald Trump’s election. For Black people, who are still victims of hate crimes more than any other group, believing police have their best interests at heart, when departments nationwide consistently support, and sometimes cover for, the officers involved killing unarmed Black (and brown) bodies, is futile.

And the patchwork of legal protections across the country don’t help. Hate crime laws are not consistent across the 46 states that have statutes criminalizing bias-motivated violence or intimidation, according to the Movement Advancement Project. And while hate crime laws in 16 of those states do not include either sexual orientation or gender identity, Arkansas, South Carolina, Indiana and Wyoming have no hate crime protections at all.

Moreover, while much of these statistics center on hate-related violence, those who face other forms such as sexual or emotional abuse have a similar reticence to law enforcement.

All of this is to say that for the comparatively few people who do choose to publicly disclose that they are victims of any sort of violence, the likelihood that they are not being forthcoming is slim. The FBI estimates that between 2% and 8% of hate crime reports are hoaxes, “a tiny number,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in comparison with the many instances even the federal government contends goes unreported.

We’ve seen what a world looks like when our default is to question and ignore those who amass the necessary courage to speak up and out against individuals and systems built on their silence and subjugation. It’s one that must go through the mass reckoning of the last five years that brought about the rise of #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and #TimesUp. If we say we've learned anything from it all, it should be to at least start from a place of believing victims. And whatever ends up being the final determination of Smollett’s account shouldn’t and doesn't change that.

Cook County Judge Michael Toomin appoints a special prosecutor to investigate the decision to dismiss all charges against Smollett, opening up the possibility that the actor could being charged again, the Associated Press reports.

Toomin also suggested that Foxx may have mishandled the case by appointing a top aide to oversee it after she recused herself.

Police release nearly 70 hours of video in connection to the Smollett investigation, including body camera footage of the actor with a with noose around his neck. The video footage also includes Smollett asking the officers to turn off their recording devices, while another group of clips shows the moment when the police apprehend the two brothers who allege they helped Smollett stage the attack.

CHICAGO -- ""Empire"" actor and R&B singer Jussie Smollett told Chicago police in January that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial and homophobic slurs. There have been dozens of twists and turns since then. Here are some key moments from the start of this story:"

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request the follow-up interview with him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” they said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

He hit the stage in Los Angeles just days after the incident where he proclaimed himself as ""the gay Tupac,"" specifying that he had fought back against his assailants. Apparently, this mindset was also present in the way he wanted to communicate his testimony. According to a Page Sixsource, the actor insisted on telling his story on television.

A source who claims to have knowledge of the Good Morning America interview booking said Smollett was ""adamant"" about his televised appearance.

“When Kim Kardashian was the victim of that horrific burglary in Paris, she went to ground, she closed down, she gave no interviews for months. You can see how shaken she was. “But Jussie was adamant that he wanted TV right away. He raised his voice and said, ‘I need to do this right now. I’m a black gay man and people need to know what happened to me. I want to tell my story.’ He wanted media right away.”

While this decision may be viewed as a way to bring awareness to homophobia and racism in America, recent developments in Jussie's case have caused speculations around his intentions."

That is the question many are asking, after CNN reported that the investigation by Chicago police into Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack has changed.

CBS News reported that, according to a source close to the investigation, the brothers who were arrested last week told police the actor paid them to participate in the alleged attack and that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. The source added that police have evidence to corroborate the sale.

ABC News also reported that the men told police they were paid. The network added that police are trying to corroborate the men's account but they have not been able to independently verify the information.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Sunday afternoon.

The brothers, who are from Nigeria, were also extras on the show. They were released last week without charges, in light of what authorities call “new evidence.” Cops say the brothers are being cooperative.

However, in a statement to multiple outlets, Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson maintain he was the victim of a crime.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continued: “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

On Jan. 29, Smollett said two men attacked him in a Chicago alley, poured a bleach-like substance on him and yelled “MAGA country.”

After the story broke, several messages on social media poured in to support him.

He was also met with messages doubting the whole story.

Last week, Smollett appeared on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" to discuss the alleged incident and refute claims the story was fake.

“I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like OK, we’re getting somewhere,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” Smollett said on the broadcast, referring to the brothers.

These sources, who are connected to the ongoing investigation, claim the police department is keeping the initial suspects, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, within reach in downtown Chicago in efforts to shield them from external influence. Apparently, they insist on blocking any contact between the Osundairo brothers and Smollett.

According to previous reports, the brothers named Smollett as part of the attack's orchestration. Given this development, the measures to keep Smollett from contacting them point to a reversal. While the Chicago Police Department continued to affirm Smollett's treatment as the victim in this case, the Osundairo brothers' testimonies could be leveraged to dismiss the complaint and even lead to Smollett's own indictment for filing a false police report.

If Smollett is found to have fabricated planned the scenario and fabricated his story, he could earn felony charges given the severity of the accusations. The penalties for this kind of false report ranges between probation to a prison sentence between 1 to 10 years. The police have already stated that Smollett would be held accountable if required.

Police are said to have found torn magazines in the brother's homes, which could account for the threatening letters sent to Jussie 8 days before the attack, along with other evidence. The Osundairos were arrested shortly after the raid but later released without charges.

Sources say the brothers purchased the rope that was tied around Smollett's neck. There is no video footage to prove this purchase because the surveillance footage is automatically purged after one week.

This comes after reports of Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo admitting to rehearsing the attack with the Empire actor and accepting a payment of $3,500 of the promised $4,000 to follow-through with the attack."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police have shifted the direction of their investigation into actor Jussie Smollett's report of a hate-crime assault and are seeking to interview him again, after releasing two men detained for questioning in the probe, a police spokesman said on Saturday.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as ""persons of interest"" who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of ""new evidence"" from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was ""no evidence to say this is a hoax.""

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that ""information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He added, ""We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was ""angered and devastated"" by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

""Empire"" debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

Guglielimi declines to address reports that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. ""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he says.

Chicago police say they're investigating a tip that on the night Smollett reported being attacked, he was seen in an elevator of his apartment building with the two brothers who were later arrested and released from custody in the probe. CPD later deemed the tip ""unfounded.""

A Cook County grand jury returns a 16-count felony indictment against Smollett.

Prosecutors abruptly dropped all charges against Smollett. His attorneys said his record had ""been wiped clean"" of the 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was assaulted by two men. The actor insisted that he had ""been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one.""

It was not immediately clear what prompted the decision to dismiss the case. Typically, a minimum condition of dropping cases is some acceptance of responsibility.

The Cook County State's Attorney's Office said in a statement that Smollett agreed to forfeit his bond. He paid $10,000 in bail to get out of jail after his arrest.

Among the unanswered questions was whether prosecutors still believe Smollett concocted the attack and whether new evidence emerged that altered their view of events.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the dropping of charges against Smollett ""a whitewash of justice"" when he and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson responded to the latest development in the case on Tuesday.

The Jussie Smollett case had the Tawana Brawley stench about it from Day One. A C-list actor from a television show that is popular with someone goes out from his hotel in Chicago in the early morning hours of Tuesday, January 29. He returns to his hotel wearing a rope around his neck and carrying his Subway sandwich. The temperature is about -9, according to AccuWeather. He claims he was jumped by a couple of white guys wearing MAGA hats who said hurty-pants things to him and welcomed him to “Trump country.” They also poured bleach on him. To people not suffering from tertiary TDS, there were bizarre things that never rang true. Strangely, in addition to letting him keep his sandwich, Smollett’s assailants also avoided hitting him in the face. They were racists but strangely gentlemanly about it. Smollett isn’t all that famous and it’s pretty doubtful anyone would recognize him at 2 a.m. Why were guys hanging out waiting to attack this actor in subzero weather? How did they know he would be jonesing for some Subway in the wee hours? And since when did Chicago become “Trump country?”

Now we know that this whole thing was contrived by Smollett and a couple of acquaintances, but guess what? Now we are all terrible people for pointing out the credulousness of the press and their willingness to push any story at all that might further the Democrat agenda. In fact, we are now being scolded by left and right over rubbing this nonsense in. First up, S. E. Cupp:

The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics. — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) February 17, 2019

The dishonesty here is so grotesque that it is actually awe-inspiring.

The giddiness was with all the news outlets that leapt on the pre-fab Trump-inspired hatred story from the start.

Your co-worker Don Lemon has been speaking to Smollett daily since this story broke. https://t.co/4CLASOPfIu — Brad Slager – Ano de Cinema Mal 🍸 🥃🎬💻 (@MartiniShark) February 17, 2019

The network this person works for pushed this story, hard, from day one and now, because she allegedly (I have to admit that I could no more sit through her show than I could watch TeleTubbies) “waited for the facts.” Neither, it seems, can very many other people.

I agree with this completely. https://t.co/40iBoO7QVS — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) February 17, 2019

I was dubious about the Smollett case, but stayed quiet until the police sorted it out, and urged others to do the same. Spiking the football does more harm than good. You can criticize the media fawning but don’t be a jerk about it. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) February 17, 2019

One last note on the Smollett thing. You may be absolutely certain Russian, and other foreign trolls are working overtime to divide Americans on this. Guaranteed. Decide how involved you want to be in that. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) February 17, 2019

This is some of the most blatant dumbfu**ery since the Covington Catholic High School kids were held to be responsible for something because they wore MAGA hats. We’re being told that we are playing into the hands of heaven-knows-what foreign plot because we are dunking on all the cretins who pushed this story. Smollett isn’t to blame. The people who pushed the story aren’t to blame. The people who were targeted by this stunt and who didn’t believe it are now the bad guys for saying “I told you so.”

The only way to stop this nonsense is to show no mercy and no forgiveness to anyone who pushed this story or pushed the story about the Covington Catholic kids. For too long, we’ve been the target of this kind of abuse. Time and again it has been proven false. And each time we’re told to magnanimous, to forgive and forget in the service of healing wounds.

F*** that noise.

I’m at a point where I want nothing to do with these people that doesn’t involve them learning to code. If anyone wants to let this slide, feel free. Just don’t expect me to stop laughing at you.

You know that True Conservatives (TM) like @secupp and whoever @BlueBoxDave is frown on pointing out facts like this, but I think it's important to do so anyway because Ahoy.🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳🛳 https://t.co/SxvmMlb7FZ — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) February 17, 2019

The media ate it hook line and sinker and ran with it without the facts. But on Saturday, CNN media reporter and host of the so-call “Reliable Sources” program, Brian Stelter tied to distance the media from their shame.

During CNN Newsroom’s eight o’clock hour, Stelter joined host Ana Cabrera by phone and downplayed ABC’s gushy interview with Smollett. “I think in retrospect, that Good Morning America interview which allowed him to tell his side of the story, that just made things worse for him. Perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America,” he said.

“Not tough enough,” was a massive understatement. As NewsBusters news analyst Kristine Marsh discovered, Robin Roberts’s interview was such a joke, she never referred to the attack as “alleged” at any point.

Earlier that evening, Stelter, called into CNN’s S.E. Cupp Unfiltered to discuss the Smollett case. There, he noted that from the beginning the accusations drew political connotations:

Because sources close to Smollett said these two attackers said, “this is MAGA country” and that they were Trump supporters. This became part of them and polarizing on day one. I wish it wasn't, but that is the reality. And that adds a layer to the story that makes it even more troubling. Obviously, again, we have to wait to see what Smollett is going to say now.

Of course, there was no admission that that was why the media were eager to spread the apparent lies without waiting for the facts.

He then decried how certain people were trying to have the case “weaponized”. “And when you’re looking at those random websites all over the web spreading information, you can end up, I think, having – This story was able to be weaponized in many different ways,” he huffed.

Perhaps by “weaponized” he meant “used to call out the media for their anti-Trump supporter bias”, because that’s exactly what was triggering S.E. Cupp herself.

In what could easily be described as a Saturday night meltdown, Cupp took to Twitter to lash out at Trump supporters for being “giddy” about being vindicated. “The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross,” she spat. “This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics.”

Cupp was playing to the lowest common denominator of CNN’s liberal viewership and got ratioed hard for it. “I’m HERE for the ratio. From you clowns? Bring it,” she demanded of Trump supporters at one point. At another point, she lashed out at The Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra and suggested he was sexist for mocking her.

Claiming “Trumpsters just proving my point all night”, Cupp admitted this was “the first time” she had commented “on Smollett, lamenting his awful, inexcusable exploitation of hate and division, and call out their giddiness over this awful, inexcusable exploitation. And they respond with... giddiness.” It’s a real insight into her mentality because it meant the first time she talked about an apparent hoaxer was to attack the people he was smearing.

8:19:07 p.m. Eastern ANA CABRERA: Brian, you're our media expert, I’ll give you the last word. How does he use the media, perhaps, going forward? BRIAN STELTER: I think in retrospect, that Good Morning America interview, which allowed him to tell his side of the story, that just made things worse for him. Perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America. But ultimately, this is not about the media or about politicians or activists, or other people that might have been fooled. It is about Jussie. And I agree with what everyone else has said, this is about why he might, and so far we don't know, why he might have made this up. It just boggles the mind, Ana. (…)"

CNN host Brian Stelter responded to Plank’s claim, asking, “So you’re saying actors and activists who were rushing to his side because they were friends with him and they support him are not the same as Chicago reporters who are trying to find out what happened?”

Miller (also known as @Redsteeze) fired back at Stelter via Twitter, pointing out several news stories in The Washington Post that had addressed the alleged attack as if Smollett’s assertions were not still being investigated.

Miller went on to give the same treatment to The New York Times.

Not to mention the politicians who jumped on board as well.

Miller concluded with a dig at several reporters — one from CNN — who flanked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris as she campaigned in South Carolina Saturday, pausing at a boutique to “insist” that she try on a sequined jacket and share photos of the entire thing.

The show has featured a ghost who haunts her living husband, a child whose stepfather is also his grandfather and an amnesia-inducing car bomb. But the latest real-world twist involving a member of its cast is the strangest – and saddest – yet.

On January 29, Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon, the openly gay heir to the show's hip-hop record label throne, was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime. He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from Empire, then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout ""this is MAGA country"", pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck.

The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on Empire, about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defense attorney.

But even before these latest details emerged, when I first heard of the attack on Smollett, I had to pause. On Empire, Jamal Lyon came out as gay in front of his homophobic, abusive father; took a bullet for that same father and overcame an addiction to pain pills. Was I reading last week's episode recap, or did this actually happen in my hometown of Chicago? Almost immediately, I had a terrible feeling that I was victim blaming, or worse, that I am so brainwashed that I no longer can hear cries of hurt and outrage from my own black community. It was a horrifying feeling that I am still trying to work through almost three weeks later.

Evan Agostini/AP On January 29, actor and musician Jussie Smollett was allegedly attacked in a baroque hate crime.

I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fibre of my being, most of all because the consequences if he were lying were almost too awful to contemplate.

And yet I struggled with Smollett's story.

I tried telling myself that it is possible that two assailants were walking around downtown Chicago at 2am in January in 10-degree weather, waiting for a black victim. In addition to that, they were stalking around with a bottle of bleach and a rope. And ultimately, the prey they selected was an actor on a show that they must've been somewhat familiar with, because they were able to not only name the show but also know that he played a gay character. Never mind the fact that he was likely bundled up because again: Chicago, January, 10 degrees. Also, after he fought to get away, he left the rope around his neck until he got to the hospital.

Perhaps I don't want to believe him because this is a stark and scary reminder of the poor condition of the country (and city) that I call home. Maybe this story makes the boogeyman in my nightmares all too real, too close and too calculating. Maybe it's because while I consider myself an ally to the LGBTQ community, I still don't understand and appreciate the daily harassment that they endure. Or maybe even though I am a black woman, I still don't know what it's like to be a black man in America.

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed ""police sources"" have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

Nader Issa/AP Last Thursday, this Chicago apartment was searched by police in connection with an investigation of an attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

If Smollett's story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ""fake news"".

And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting. This could be one tragedy that the Lyon family – and more importantly, the ordinary people who loved the show and invested in Smollett and his character – could never overcome."

Factory shooting victims include a college intern on his first day

The five victims of the shooting rampage at a suburban Chicago factory Friday included the manufacturing company’s human resources manager, a college intern and a stock room attendant who doubled as a forklift operator, police said Saturday. One of the victims, Trevor Wehner of DeKalb, had just started with Henry Pratt Co., an industrial valve manufacturer, as an intern in the human resources department, according to Cynthia Rose Cascarano, a family friend. Six police officers were also injured during the shooting. Police say the alleged gunman opened fire after he lost his job. A prayer vigil was set to take place Sunday to memorialize the victims.

Police pursue claims that Jussie Smollett may have faked attack

Two Nigerian brothers told Chicago police that they were paid by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett to stage an attack on him, a police source told USA TODAY. The source, who requested anonymity because of the investigation, said police aim to interview Smollett again to question him about the brothers' account. ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. Smollett's attorneys said Saturday that there is no truth to reports the actor played a role in the assault and that ""anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" On Sunday, Chicago police said they were pursuing ""additional detective work"" into the allegations.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to co-operate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Police say Smollett told detectives that the attackers yelled he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan that some critics of Trump have decried as racist and discriminatory.

A grand jury in Chicago has filed a new indictment against the actor Jussie Smollett, accusing him of lying to the police about a hate crime detectives say he staged. The charges revived the case against Mr. Smollett 11 months after prosecutors abruptly dropped it. On Monday, Mr. Smollett pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer said she was seeking to have the case thrown out on double jeopardy grounds.

The charges were filed after a special prosecutor, Dan K. Webb, took a new look at the case after a judge ruled that the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, had not properly recused her office.

[Read more about the new indictment.]

Here’s a timeline of how we got here.

Jan. 29: Mr. Smollett, who is black and gay, tells the police that at about 1:30 a.m., two masked men he believed to be white attacked him on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in downtown Chicago. The assailants, according to Mr. Smollett, hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.

Mr. Smollett says he went home and a close associate of his reported the incident to the police 40 minutes after it happened. Anthony Guglielmi, the chief spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, later told The Chicago Sun-Times that Mr. Smollett had been hesitant to call the police because of his status as a public figure."

Jussie Smollett

The 36-year-old actor - who required hospital treatment after he was attacked last month - has rubbished claims that he knows the people responsible for the incident, after Chicago Police announced they had ""shifted the trajectory"" of their investigation.

Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, the actor's attorneys, said in a statement: ""As a victim of a hate crime who has co-operated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Jussie claims to have been the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

The actor has also dismissed the suggestion that he was somehow complicit in the incident.

The statement continued: ""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

The statement was released shortly after two brothers arrested in connection with the attack on Jussie were released without charge.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote on Twitter: ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

Jussie previously discussed the incident on 'Good Morning America', saying it had all happened ""so fast"".

He added: ""It felt like minutes but it was probably [over in] 30 seconds."""

What did Booker say?



On the exact same day the Smollett attack made headlines nationwide — meaning before any concrete facts surfaced — Booker passed judgment and characterized what allegedly happened as a ""modern-day lynching.""

What is Booker saying now?

While campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday, media asked Booker to comment on the most recent reporting about the alleged Smollett attack, which indicate the actor orchestrated a hoax for reasons that remain unknown.

However, this time Booker cautioned to withhold comment about the latest developments until the facts are confirmed.

""Well, the information is still coming out. I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources,"" Booker said.

Booker went on to claim that ""bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way,"" explaining, without evidence, that the majority of those attacks since 9/11 have been perpetuated by ""right-wing terrorists"" and ""white supremacists.""

The Massachusetts senator told the crowd how her own family almost lost their home when she was growing up and described Washington, D.C., as a place that works well for corporations and lobbyists but not families.

Sen. Cory Booker, who called the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett a “modern-day lynching” after the actor reported it, is withholding judgment on reports alleging Smollett is under investigation for possible involvement in his own assault.

Booker told reporters after meeting with hundreds of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, that he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.”

The Democratic presidential candidate turned his focus back to combating hate crimes broadly. Booker called for a unified pushback against “attacks on people because they’re different.”

The Chicago Police Department is acknowledging that the Smollett case has “shifted” after ruling out two potential suspects. Smollett’s attorneys have denied reports of his potential involvement in the alleged attack and said he will cooperate with police.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld tells ABC’s “This Week” that Trump is racking up $1 trillion a year in debt that will crush taxpayers.

Weld says the government should be preparing workers to shift to jobs in “artificial intelligence and robotics and drones and machine learning and autonomous vehicles.”

But he says policymakers aren’t paying attention to that because “they’re so busy with divisiveness and trying to make everyone feel awful.”

Now, the Chicago Police Department is reportedly planning to hold him accountable for his own attack. Over the last five days, there have been multiple developments in the case, and the latest investigative findings may suggest Jussie Smollett staged his own attack.

According to the Jasmine Brand, Jussie Smollett may soon be facing charges for his alleged involvement in his highly publicized attack. It has been reported that investigators are starting to believe Jussie may have orchestrated his own attack with the help of the two Nigerian brothers, identified as Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, who were previously interviewed by police.

Many details about the case have raised questions as things don’t appear to add up. One aspect that really raised questions was the fact that Jussie Smollett knew the Nigerian brothers prior to the attack. In fact, they both reportedly worked on the set of Empire, and one of them previously worked as Jussie’s personal trainer.

After the brothers’ release on Friday evening, Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi released a statement confirming the latest development had “shifted the trajectory” of the investigation.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said Guglielmi.

Despite the allegations and possible charges Jussie Smollett is facing, the famed actor-singer maintains his innocence. On Saturday, February 16, his attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement in response to the mounting allegations against him. Jussie’s attorneys claim he is “angered and devastated” that investigators would suggest he staged his own attack.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

In the state of Illinois, filing a false police report is classified as an act of disorderly conduct and a class 4 felony. Jussie Smollett could face up to three years behind bars if investigators can prove he falsified the police report filed as a result of his alleged attack."

Smollett has claimed that two men attacked him at 2am on January 29, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department has consistently said that it was treating him as a victim, but that appears to have changed in the last 24 hours.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" said department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

On Saturday, Guglielmi reaffirmed that the police department was seeking to re-interview Smollett.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" the Chicago police said in a statement posted to Twitter.

Investigators arrested two Nigerian brothers on Wednesday night and held them for questioning for two days. One of the men worked as an extra on Empire, and both know Smollett from the show, according to their attorney.

According to local media reports, the brothers were confronted with evidence that they had purchased the rope at an Ace hardware store. The brothers were released late on Friday and are now cooperating with police.

CNN reported on Saturday that police believe that Smollett paid the two men to attack him. The network cited two unnamed law enforcement sources.

Smollett's reps have called previous reports that the attacked was staged ""ridiculous."" Fox has also stood by the actor.

His reps did not respond to request for comment, but lawyers for the actor issued a statement on Saturday denying that he orchestrated his assault, and saying he is ""angered"" and ""devastated"" by recent developments in the case.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said his lawyers, Victor P. Henderson and Todd S. Pugh.

In the statement, the lawyers added that one of the men is Smollett's personal trainer.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" they said.

The lawyers said that Smollett is ""the victim of a hate crime,"" and will continue to cooperate with investigators.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" they said.

The full statement:

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

But from the beginning, some believed that aspects of the alleged Jan. 29 hate crime against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett didn’t quite add up.

As days passed, information continued to be revealed that raised questions regarding whether the attack really happened or not.

If his claims are false and the whole thing was indeed a hoax, the actor may face time behind bars, as the Daily Mail reported.

“Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony,” the outlet noted.

“That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison.”

WBBM reported Saturday night, citing anonymous sources familiar with the investigation, that the two brothers who were questioned by police in connection with the incident may have rehearsed the attack with Smollett days prior.

The brothers “were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return,” WBBM wrote, citing those anonymous sources.

The sources also claimed Smollett asked one of the brothers to buy the rope used in the attack and even paid for it himself. The rope reportedly came from a hardware store in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago.

“Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett,” WBBM reported. “The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29.”

Police now want to interview Smollett again regarding the alleged attack. Smollett, meanwhile, put out a statement through his attorneys denying that the incident was a hoax.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

It’s worth remembering that the moment news broke about an alleged hate crime carried out against Smollett, celebrities and politicians on the left jumped on the bandwagon and treated the entire thing as fact.

Attacking someone because of their race or sexuality is horrible. But the same could be said about creating a hoax that blames political opponents.

While it’s not proven that this is what happened in the Smollett case, there are certainly plenty of questions that still need answering.

The liberal media got burned by Jussie Smollett’s apparent hate crime hoax because they wanted to believe the cartoonish image they concocted for Trump supporters and conservatives. The media ate it hook line and sinker and ran with it without the facts. But on Saturday, CNN media reporter and host of the so-call “Reliable Sources” program, Brian Stelter tied to distance the media from their shame.

During CNN Newsroom’s 8 o’clock hour, Stelter joined host Ana Cabrera by phone and downplayed ABC’s gushy interview with Smollett. “I think in retrospect, that Good Morning America interview which allowed him to tell his side of the story, that just made things worse for him. Perhaps the questioning was not tough enough on Good Morning America,” he said.

“Not tough enough,” was a massive understatement. As NewsBusters news analyst Kristine Marsh discovered, Robin Roberts’s interview was such a joke, she never referred to the attack as “alleged” at any point.

Law enforcement sources connected to the investigation tell the outlet that they are keeping a close eye on the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested, questioned and then released on Friday. Ola and Abel Osundairo, one of which worked as an extra on the hit FOX music drama series Empire, are reportedly staying in downtown Chicago as the case pushes forward. Investigators want to be sure they have no contact with Smollett.

According to published reports, police suspect the singer/actor paid the brothers to orchestrate an assault on him late last month. But Smollett’s attorneys refute the allegations.

The Osundairo brothers were released without charges on Friday after investigators discovered “new evidence” that shifted the “trajectory of the investigation,” BBC.com reports.

As the investigation rolls on, sources connected to the case are spilling the tea to TMZ, such as details on the raid of the brothers’ home and the discovery of magazines with missing pages. Investigators are now trying to determine if they are connected to the threatening letter that Smollett received in the week before the alleged attack. Law officials also believe the brothers purchased the rope that was around his neck after the incident.

When the Empire star was notified that the brothers were in custody and considered suspects, he reportedly declined to sign complaints against them. Police officials found it suspicious that the area where Smollett said he was attacked happened near an obscure camera, which was pointed away from the scene of the crime. Cops also thought it strange that he knew the location of this particular camera.

Investigators also don’t believe the attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because, “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire.'”

Smollett’s legal team vehemently deny he had any role in the assault he alleges was carried out by two white males.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The attorneys also notes that it is “impossible to believe” that one of the brothers could be involved with this attack as he is Smollett’s personal trainer.

“At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,” the statement read.

In an interview last week with Good Morning America that aired Thursday, Smollett expressed frustration about not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

He also denied reports that said he told police the attackers wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

“I never said that,” he told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Meanwhile many agree with attorney Scott Hechinger, who made note about the credibility of the Chicago police, “No idea what actually happend w/ Jussie Smollett. But do know that 4 years ago, Chicago PD spent 13 months justifying Laquan McDonald’s murder before releasing dashcam video showing he was walking away before being shot at 16x by an officer. Why are we just accepting their word?”"

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ that a panel will hear the case, but the outlet didn’t elaborate on who is facing charges — or what they might be.

The “Empire” star told cops he was assaulted in Chicago on Jan. 29 by two men spewing racist and homophobic slurs at him — but his story has since come under fire as sources have alleged to news outlets that he actually paid some pals to stage the whole thing.

Cops arrested brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo on Wednesday after they were captured on security footage near the scene — but they were released Friday without charges, and police then said evidence they gave has shifted the “trajectory of the investigation.”

Cops are also now investigating whether magazines with missing pages that they found when raiding the brothers’ homes are connected to a threatening letter sent to Smollett a weeks before the attack with cut-out letters reading, “You will die black f–,” according to TMZ.

Smollett originally made it clear to cops that he’d sign complaints against his assailants — but once the Osundairos were arrested, he said he knew them and felt bad for them, and refused to press charges, sources tell TMZ.

Police originally found the star’s story suspect when he brought them to the scene of the incident and pointed out a camera, noting the whole attack was caught on video — and were also suspicious of the claim that his assailants shouted, “This is MAGA country,” because “Not a single Trump supporter watches ‘Empire,'” the gossip site reports.

Sources have told CBS Chicago that Smollett paid the bodybuilding brothers $3,500 for the attack — with the promise of another $500 to come — and even coughed up the cash for the rope the duo purchased for the assault.

Smollett denies playing any role in the attack.

His lawyers said in a statement over the weekend that one of the brothers was his personal trainer, and the star finds it “impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”"

Empire star Jussie Smollett is ‘angered and devastated’ by the latest accusations.

What exactly happened on the early morning of January 29th?

That is now a puzzling question, with Chicago Police apparently shifting their investigation into the matter. Jussie Smollett, a star on the TV series Empire, initially reported that he was the victim of a brutal hate crime attack, a development that provoked a wave of outrage.

Smollett is openly-gay and African-American, and an ardent supporter of LGBTQ causes.

Initially, Chicago Police were unable to find any suspects, despite assigning nearly a dozen investigators while examining roughly 20 nearby cameras.

Now, it appears that two individuals have been retained for questioning.

The pair, both from Nigeria, had previously worked on the set of Empire and may have been paid to ‘attack’ Smollett.

According to a report from CNN, the individuals are being questioned as potential co-conspirators in the attack. The duo are apparently Nigerian brothers, and fully cooperating with police investigators. “Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month,” the CNN report states.

The CNN report follows earlier indications of a shift in the investigation with Chicago Police. The department’s inability to receive phone records from Smollett or his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, initially raised suspicions. Ultimately, Smollett and his manager offered heavily-redacted phone records, though Chicago Police protested that the evidence was too scant to assist in the investigation.

Smollett claims that his attackers attached a noose around his neck while screaming racist and homophobic epithets. They also reportedly screamed ‘This is MAGA country,’ referring to Donald Trump’s well-worn presidential campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.

Smollett’s manager says he heard the epithets while on the phone with his client.

But is that what really happened?

According to CNN’s sources, one of the Nigerian brothers purchased the rope from a nearby Chicago hardware store. That rope was then fashioned into a noose. That information, if true, raises glaring questions about these ‘attackers,’ especially given their previous ties to Smollett.

Both reportedly worked on the set of Empire, and seem highly unlikely to spearhead a racially-charged attack in the name of ‘MAGA’.

At present, Chicago Police are releasing limited information about these suspects. They’ve only pointed to ‘new evidence,’ part of a fairly tight-lipped public stance on the situation.

But in a separate leak to Deadline, a source claiming to be inside Chicago Police says the investigation is markedly shifting. “The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told Deadline.

Separately, a spokesperson for the police department confirmed that a ‘shift’ had indeed occurred.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” a statement affirmed. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

The questioned individuals have now been identified as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo.

Smollett’s lawyers, on the other hand, are aggressively countering the CNN and Deadline stories.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from Smollett’s attorneys read.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Fabricating a crime or filing a false police report can result in felony charges in the state of Illinois."

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue co-operating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

------

This story has been corrected to show that the spokeswoman's last name is Kavanagh, not Kavanaugh, and that the first name of Smollett's character on the show is Jamal, not James."

But police this week arrested and charged Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report — a felony.

“Jussie Smollet is under arrest and in custody of detectives,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Thursday morning.

The arrest and charge follows news reports calling Smollett’s initial claims into question, suggesting that Smollett orchestrated the supposed hate crime attack himself. In a news conference on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett was allegedly unhappy with his salary, and the attack was staged to his benefit.

Smollett, who is black and gay, is also a queer character in the Fox drama Empire. Initial reports of the attack were quickly met with a widespread outpouring of support from Smollett’s colleagues, the LGBTQ community at large, and politicians. Empire co-creator Danny Strong, for example, initially condemned the attack in a tweet supporting Smollett.

But on Friday, the show’s producers confirmed Smollett will no longer appear on Empire.

Chicago police said from the outset that they were treating the incident as a possible hate crime. Media reports followed every development in the unexpected case of a celebrity who claimed to be a victim of targeted violence and hate.

But in the weeks since Smollett’s story first made headlines, the narrative has taken a number of twists and turns — from assumed tragedy to suspected hoax. Several reports, citing unnamed sources, suggested that police were investigating whether Smollett helped orchestrate his own attack. And federal investigators got involved too, reportedly looking into if Smollett played a role in sending a threatening letter to himself prior to the attack.

Things took a turn on Wednesday when Chicago police confirmed that Smollett was now the suspect in a criminal investigation for allegedly filing a false police report — a felony. The police then arrested Smollett on Thursday. They said that Smollett had paid two men, one of whom he knew from Empire, $3,500 to fake the attack.

Smollett, however, has stood by his initial claims. He reportedly told the cast of Empire, after he was released on bail, “I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

His lawyers defended him in a statement as well: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

The story has activated virtually every lightning rod issue dividing America today, from racism and homophobia to distrust in the media and politically motivated attacks. Here’s what we know.

Police initially detained two suspects — only to release them when the investigation’s trajectory “shifted”

Smollett said he was attacked on January 29 by two masked men at the entrance of the Loews hotel in Chicago. He claimed that they yelled racist and homophobic remarks — making references to his show Empire and to President Donald Trump’s signature slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Smollett said one attacker tied a noose around his neck and poured a substance on him that he believed was bleach, and then the two fled.

Police were unable to find surveillance video of the attack even though it was in a heavily trafficked area with plenty of cameras nearby. They did, however, release images from surveillance video a day after the incident that showed two shadowed people walking down a sidewalk. Authorities wanted to take them in for questioning.

On February 13, police arrested two men, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo. Police later confirmed that one of the brothers worked for Empire, which is likely how Smollett knew them prior to the attack.

Police raided the brothers’ home in search of the liquid suspected of being poured on Smollett. They recovered Empire scripts, a phone, and a black mask.

Until February 15, the brothers were being treated by investigators as “persons of interest.” But by that afternoon, the narrative had turned. Police released them both without charges, saying new evidence had “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

News reports, citing anonymous sources, suggested the attack was a hoax

Rumors began circulating that Smollett was somehow involved in his own attack, and that he may even have orchestrated it all. By February 16, Guglielmi, the Chicago police spokesperson, said they were looking to interview Smollett again, although authorities still hadn’t indicated why.

Initially, local media outlets were primarily the ones driving the story. According to CBS Chicago, two unnamed sources with “intimate knowledge of the investigation” said Smollett was potentially behind the attack and had involved the two brothers. ABC7 ran another story, again with unnamed sources, who claimed that police were investigating whether the attack was staged “allegedly because Smollett was being written off of ‘Empire’” — although police now say the attack was over his salary, not because he was being written off the show.

National outlets then picked up the story. An unnamed source told CBS News that the Osundairos told investigators that Smollett had paid them off. CNN similarly reported that “[t]wo law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation” said Smollett “paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.”

CBS News, citing anonymous sources, reported that Smollett was upset that he didn’t get a “bigger reaction” from a threatening letter sent to him, so he staged the attack. Two federal officials told ABC News that the FBI and US Postal Service are now investigating if Smollett played a role in sending the threatening letter, and Chicago police claim the letter was also fake.

In his first televised interview since first reporting his account of the attack, Smollett on February 14 told ABC host Robin Roberts that he was “pissed off” that critics doubted his story.

.@JussieSmollett to @RobinRoberts on attack: ""I will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed...I do subscribe to the idea that we have the right & responsibility to make something meaningful out of the things that happen to us."" https://t.co/3HbyU2SFxe pic.twitter.com/QPeSISqOXf — Good Morning America (@GMA) February 14, 2019

Stories then surfaced that Smollett had hired a high-profile defense attorney, Michael D. Monico, who is best known for representing Michael Cohen, but those reports appear to have been premature. Instead, Smollett is being represented by Chicago defense attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson. On February 16, they released a statement saying Smollett is “angered and devastated” to find that he knows the alleged perpetrators in the case.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement continued.

Police, however, continued pursuing the investigation. And now Smollett is charged for allegedly filing a false police report, although he still stands by his original claims.

The rumors feed into a conservative conspiracy around media bias

Underpinning all the twists in Smollett’s story is his suggestion from day one that his alleged assailants supported Trump. The actor said in his statement to police that his masked attacker told him, “This is MAGA country,” along with racist and homophobic remarks. He later had to push back on reports that they were wearing MAGA hats while pinning him down.

“They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae,” Smollett said in his interview with Roberts on February 14.

So once rumors began to surface suggesting that Smollett manufactured his attack, conservative media and pundits quickly pointed to his story as evidence of a broad conspiracy aimed at vilifying Trump supporters.

As conservative CNN commentator S.E. Cupp noted, Trump backers were “giddy” in their reaction to reports speculating about a hoax. And it’s clear from the responses to Cupp’s tweet that Smollett’s critics saw the new developments as validation that Trump supporters — not minorities, LGBTQ individuals, or other disadvantaged groups — are the people who are actually being persecuted.

The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics. — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) February 17, 2019

It’s very similar to the “validation” seen last month after the Covington Catholic High School teens were dragged online for seeming to harass Native American elders. Once it became clear there was more to the story, conservative media quickly coalesced behind the students, saying they were the real victims in this case: victims of liberals’ instinctive dismissal of anyone wearing a MAGA cap.

As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp wrote at the time, the Covington drama became something of a Rorschach test, with “each side seeing what it wants to in a way that’s more revealing about their own worldviews than the actual incident.” For the right, it revealed several of their “core animating assumptions”:

From their point of view, the liberal reaction to the video, and not the footage itself, was the biggest problem. It reveals a culture where white men are acceptable targets of hate who deserve no sympathy and no due process, and where the left-wing mob wields tremendous power through its command of the public sphere. That view connects to a broader assumption shared by many conservatives: that white Christian men are a persecuted minority in modern America.

Then, as now, the ensuing backlash to the initial news reports also ignited anti-media sentiment among conservatives. Even though most coverage of the actor’s attack directly reflected police statements, and it was clear the investigation was ongoing, the developing narrative is being taken as a sign that journalists blindly accept any stories with a careless disregard for the facts — particularly those stories that support liberal ideals.

In both the Covington and Smollett cases, liberals were quick to condemn what was, at first glance, unacceptable behavior. In Smollett’s case, even Trump, who is often criticized for taking his time before commenting on cases where the victims are minorities or from disadvantaged groups, denounced Smollet’s alleged attack as “horrible.”

“It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned,” he said from the Oval Office, days after news of the supposed attack broke.

No matter how the facts shake out, the case now hits at the core identity that Trump shares with his supporters, perpetuating a dangerous worldview that the media is corrupt and the stories of racism and bigotry are better off not being believed."

Chicago police said Sunday they're still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that ""shifted"" their investigation of a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor.

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue co-operating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The bodybuilding brothers who Jussie Smollett reportedly paid to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him both declared bankruptcy two years ago.

Newly unearthed court documents show budding model-actors Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo both filed for bankruptcy in Illinois in September 2016 — with each declaring large students loans and very little income at the time.

Abimbola reported $161,481 in debt, including $85,475 in student loans, while only making $160 a month — while his brother claimed he had $72,771 in liabilities, including $39,114 in student loans, and made just $142 a month.

Both reported being part-owners of a party supply store, but said it was operating at a loss.

The brothers were arrested Wednesday after Smollett reported being assaulted by two men shouting racist and homophobic slurs at him on Jan. 29 — but were released Friday without charges.

CBS Chicago is now reporting that sources say the “Empire” star allegedly paid the pair $3,500 to stage the assault — with another $500 promised to come — and even rehearsed the melee with them beforehand.

Smollett also allegedly paid for a rope used in the attack.

The 36-year-old actor denies having any role in setting up the assault.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement Saturday."

Booker cited the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue this past October as well as the June 2015 shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C.

""What we're seeing is attacks on people because they're different and we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and the bigotry that sources them,"" Booker said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, has claimed he was attacked by two masked men early on Jan. 29 as he walked to his Chicago apartment from a Subway restaurant. Smollett alleged his assailants shouted racial and anti-gay slurs at him, beat him, and poured bleach on him.

'NEW EVIDENCE' PROMPTS RELEASE OF TWO MEN QUESTIONED IN JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE, CHICAGO PD SAYS

Hours after reports of the attack surfaced, Booker tweeted: ""The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe."" In the same message, Booker advocated the passage of legislation making lynching a federal hate crime.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers in the reported attack but released them Friday without charges. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the pair had given officers information that had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"" and confirmed that police had reached out to Smollett's attorney to request a follow-up interview.

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Sunday they're still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that ""shifted"" their investigation of a reported attack on the ""Empire"" actor.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

CHICAGO — Chicago police and representatives for Jussie Smollett were keeping quiet about the investigation into a reported attack on the “Empire” actor a day after authorities said the case had “shifted” and that they want to interview Smollett again.

In a statement Saturday night, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the information was received in interviews with two individuals who were previously questioned by police and that the department has reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.

Chicago police said last month they were investigating the alleged assault against Smollett, who is black and openly gay, as a possible hate crime. Smollett told police he was attacked about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance, which he believes was bleach, on him. According to Smollett, at least one assailant told him “this is MAGA country” during the alleged attack.

On Friday, Chicago police said they had arrested two potential suspects on “probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime.” Guglielmi told The Post that at least one of the two men, who were later released without being charged, has worked on the Fox drama. Guglielmi did not confirm whether the men — who are of Nigerian descent and believed to be the “persons of interest” seen in surveillance images released by police last month — knew Smollett.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said in a tweet Friday night.

The latest police statement comes amid increasing news reports, which cite unnamed police sources, that Smollett may have staged his own attack in the city last month.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” attorneys for the actor said in a statement late Saturday. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying … Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Local outlets published reports Thursday evening that questioned the veracity of Smollett’s allegations. CBS Chicago — citing an unnamed “source with intimate knowledge of the investigation” — reported that investigators believe that Smollett and two “non-cooperating witnesses” had staged the attack. ABC7, meanwhile, published a report citing “multiple sources” who told the ABC affiliate that police were investigating whether the actor and the “two persons of interest” had “staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off ‘Empire.’

But in a tweet Thursday night, Guglielmi said the hoax reports were “unconfirmed by case detectives.” He noted that police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who told ABC7 earlier this month that Smollett “had been cooperative” in the investigation, had followed up with them “to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Entertainment also responded to the reports Thursday in a strongly worded statement: “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off EMPIRE is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Several of Smollett’s “Empire” colleagues, including co-creator Danny Strong, also denied the show had considered writing off the actor’s character, Jamal Lyon, an openly gay R&B artist.

The hoax reports surfaced on the same day “Good Morning America” aired an interview with Smollett, who talked in detail for the first time about the alleged attack. Smollett appeared emotional as he spoke to ABC’s Robin Roberts. He said he was “pissed off” about the attack — and at critics doubting his account.

“At first, it was like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it, because it’s the truth,’ ” Smollett said. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that, like how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’ ”

The actor told Roberts he believed some doubted his story because he said his attackers referenced President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

Smollett also said some media reports about his alleged assault were inaccurate. He said he never told police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats. “I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

He explained some of the more scrutinized details of the case, including why he didn’t change his clothes or remove the rope from his neck after the attack (“I wanted [the police] to see what this was,” he told Roberts). Smollett also explained his initial hesitation — referenced in the police report — to go to police.

“There’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man, you are considered somehow to be weak,” he said. “And I’m not weak. We, as a people, are not weak.”

Outside of acting, Smollett has established himself as an activist, working alongside organizations dedicated to HIV/AIDS awareness, civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy — a background he referenced while addressing the skepticism surrounding his claims.

“I’m an advocate. I respect too much the people — who I am now, one of those people — who have been attacked in any way,” he told Roberts. “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

On Saturday evening, Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago Police Department, told ET, ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

CBS News is reporting that they have sources who claim Smollett orchestrated the attack with the two men who were arrested in connection with the case on Wednesday and released on Friday without charges.

A rep for the actor did not respond to requests for comment regarding the new allegations. A FOX rep declined to comment.

On Saturday, CNN reported that they had two law enforcement sources who claim Chicago Police believe Smollett paid the two men to orchestrate the assault. CNN said at the time that the men were cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Rumors circulated earlier in the week that claimed that Smollett orchestrated his own attack in response to allegedly being written off Empire. However, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment, who produce the show, released a statement to ET denying Smollett's character was being dropped from the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the joint statement reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Thursday morning, Smollett made his first television appearance since the incident, recounting the attack on Good Morning America.

""I heard as I was crossing the intersection, I heard, ‘Empire!’ I don’t answer to Empire,” he recalled. ""My name ain’t Empire. And I didn’t answer. I kept walking and then I heard ‘f****t Empire n****r’ so I turned around and said, ‘The f**k did you just say to me?’”

And his attorney predicts it may happen.

Mark Geragos, who helmed the Kaepernick case that was confidentially settled for what some estimated could be as much as $60 million to $80 million, told CNN his client “absolutely wants to play.”

“He wants to compete at the highest level,” Geragos said. “This is a competitive young man.”

Geragos reportedly spoke to Kaepernick on Saturday about playing

“I think you’re going to see…within the next two weeks that somebody is going to step up and do the right thing, and you want me to predict who?” Geragos told ESPN. “Besides the Panthers, it would not surprise me if [Patriots owner] Bob Kraft makes a move.”

The Panthers signed Kaepernick’s fellow collusion case partner, Eric Reid, to a three-year contract recently after picking him up four games into last season. The Panthers have a liberal owner and may be without resident quarterback Cam Newton, who had shoulder surgery in late January.

The Super Bowl champion Patriots are an unlikely destination for Kaepernick, having Tom Brady at quarterback and a conservative owner.

Kaepernick has been out of the league since declining to pick up his option from the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. He has since had a few nibbles, but never signed. He did have a lucrative deal with Nike on an ad campaign, and also reportedly turned down a deal with the upstart Alliance of American Football league."

Kavanaugh. Covington. And, now, Jussie Smollett.

Having been burned on the first two and despite questions from the outset on the third, the major media and several top Democratic politicians rushed to voice their outrage over the alleged “hate crime” perpetrated against actor Jussie Smollett.

Smollett, who stars in Empire, told authorities he was attacked early Jan. 29 by two white men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

“In Jussie Smollett’s case, the claim that two people in Chicago would have attacked this guy at 2 a.m. on a subzero night with a rope, yelling ‘This is MAGA country!’ ought to have set off people’s b.s. detectors,” Rod Dreher wrote for The American Conservative on Feb. 16.

BS meters were also in short supply among several top Democratic politicians when Smollett’s story emerged.

Sen. Cory Booker tweeted: “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Booker and Harris are running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: “The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

And this from the Rev. Al Shartpon: “The reported hate attack on my friend and brother, actor Jussie Smollett is despicable and outrageous. The guilty must face the maximum.”

CBS News reported on Feb. 16 that two brothers from Nigeria told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack and that they purchased the rope, which was found around Smollett’s neck, at a nearby hardware store.

There were questions and inconsistencies in Smollett’s story from the beginning. Leaks from Chicago police had indicated they were investigating a potential hoax. But “most of the national media *still* uncritically reported Smollett’s tale of being ‘brutally assaulted’ by racist, homophobic Trump supporters – right up to the bitter end,” PJ Media’s Debra Heine noted.

“This is America in 2019,” CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin proclaimed after Smollett came forward with his story.

Some in the media not only reported Smollett’s allegations as fact, they even attacked those who raised doubts, Heine noted.

The Mercury News’ Martha Ross accused Donald Trump Jr. of “promoting a conspiracy theory” because he “seemed to believe” Smollett’s hate crime story was a hoax.

“Trump Jr. liked and retweeted posts by people who have suggested that the reported attack early Tuesday in Chicago could be a left-wing hoax, perpetrated by a Hollywood celebrity who has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump’s presidency, according to Splinter News and a review of Trump Jr.’s Twitter feed. Among those promoting this view are conservative commentator Candace Owens, whose post Friday was liked by Trump Jr.”

In the Washington Post, Eugene Scott, who covers identity politics, wrote: “Smollett’s experience is far too common for black gay men, particularly those who speak out against racism and sexism.”

Scott cited activist Preston Mitchum, who said: “Everyday our multiple marginalized identities increase our chances of facing racist, homophobic vitriol – and this fact has only intensified under the Trump administration with their dog whistle politics. So as we wait to see if justice is served for Smollett, we as Black queer people wait to see if America will finally see our lives as worth protecting. Because history has rarely been on the side of Black queer folk.”

Ultimately, “all it took was a working BS detector and some common sense to have doubts about Smollett’s implausible story – but those are in short supply these days in the MSM, apparently,” Heine wrote.

Filing a false report to police in Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony. Anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison.

“You would think that after falling for ‘tribal elder’ Nathan Phillips’ dubious claims, last month – to the point of being legally culpable – the media would be a bit more circumspect,” Heine wrote. “But no.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett is reportedly not being treated as an official suspect as police continue to investigate the attack against him.

The 34-year-old actor reported a brutal attack in Chicago last month, claiming he was set upon by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs as they beat him in the early hours.

Jussie has been cooperating with the Chicago Police Department in relation to the incident, but police reveal they are still trying to ‘verify’ details.

A spokesperson for the CPD told TMZ: ‘We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question.

‘After new developments, we’ve reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.’

Two men have been arrested and released without charge in connection to the incident (Picture: Instagram)

It comes after another police spokesperson told Variety that the ‘trajectory of the investigation’ has ‘shifted’ following their interviews with two suspects.

The two men, who are brothers, were arrested last week but released without charge.

In a statement on Saturday, Jussie denied allegations that he had ‘paid the brothers to orchestrate the attack’.

A rep on behalf of the actor said: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

‘He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police had reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview with him.

Pam Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanaugh, said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett reported last month that he was attacked by men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault. They also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police."

“Despite the inconsistencies, I can’t blindly believe Chicago PD,” DuVernay, who voiced support for Smollett after the attack, said on Twitter. “The department that covered up shooting Laquan McDonald over a dozen times? That operated an off-site torture facility? That one? I’ll wait. Whatever the outcome, this won’t stop me from believing others. It can’t.”

DuVernay is referring to the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald at the hands of Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014. Initially, Chicago PD reported that McDonald was carrying a folding knife and walking erratically at the time he was shot, and ruled that the shooting was justified. But dash cam footage released a year later showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald while he was walking away, leading to the officer being charged with murder.

A federal civil rights investigation conducted by the Department of Justice found that Chicago PD fostered a culture of “excessive violence” against people of color and “poor supervision” of officers.

On Jan. 29, Smollett told Chicago police that he was assaulted by two men outside a Loews hotel, and that the two men called him “‘Empire’ f—t” and “‘Empire’ n—er'” while beating him, wrapping a rope around his neck, and covering him in bleach.

But this weekend, CNN reported that new evidence suggests that Smollett paid two bodybuilder brothers to orchestrate the attack. Smollett’s attorneys have denied such claims.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement regarding the recent reports about his potential participation in the attack. It began,

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

The Chicago Police Department’s Chief Communications Officer confirms the case has taken a turn based on details provided by the brothers, saying; “The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

He adds that police have reached out to Jussie’s attorney to request a follow-up interview and possible questioning."

“Nigerians and fake nooses, MAGA hats and a #CraftyBeaver. #CowFarts and trains to Hawaii. A lying Senator saying she’s a Cherokee. A #HeelsUp Senator sleeping her way to the bottom. Congresswoman married her own brother? Governor in a KKK robe. Ah, #Democrats!!! Gotta love ‘em!” he wrote.

Look:

Nigerians and fake nooses, MAGA hats and a #CraftyBeaver. #CowFarts and trains to Hawaii. A lying Senator saying she’s a Cherokee. A #HeelsUp Senator sleeping her way to the bottom. Congresswoman married her own brother? Governor in a KKK robe. Ah, #Democrats!!! Gotta love ‘em! — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) February 17, 2019

He nailed it, did he not? THIS is the party of leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.

But in case you’re not fully up to date on the goings-on of the Democrat Party, here’s a quick rundown of what exactly Woods had been referring to.

Nigerians and fake nooses, MAGA hats and a #CraftyBeaver:

The far-left erupted in outrage late last month when black, gay Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett claimed he’d been attacked in Chicago by two white Trump supporters:

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe. To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 29, 2019

This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it’s the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it. Praying for Jussie and his family. https://t.co/eylvxhLT0u — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 29, 2019

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence. https://t.co/2accVEJrCG — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 29, 2019

Smollett specifically claimed that on Jan. 29, two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931.

It was eventually learned that the whole thing was a hoax perpetrated by two Nigerian brothers on Smollett’s behalf. Whoops.

#CowFarts and trains to Hawaii:

Earlier this month socialist congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released a radical “Green New Deal” that literally calls for eradicating cow farts and replacing airplanes with high-speed rail.

To this day it remains unclear how exactly Americans would travel to island states like Hawaii or other nations, for that matter, with high-speed rail alone.

What’s known is that every Democrat presidential candidate has endorsed AOC’s plan, as the young congresswoman herself noted while speaking Saturday at her inaugural ceremony in the Bronx:

A lying Senator saying she’s a Cherokee:

For years Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has falsely claimed to be a Native American Indian. A DNA test she took last year proved that she’s just a standard, run-of-the-mill white person.

A #HeelsUp Senator sleeping her way to the bottom:

A week after Sen. Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for president late last month, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown published an op-ed admitting that he’d partook in an extramarital affair with her back in the 1990s — and that during this affair he’d rewarded her with perks.

“Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco,” he wrote.

Talk about women’s empowerment …

Congresswoman married her own brother:

Unconfirmed rumors have been circulating that antisemitic, terrorist-friendly Muslim congresswoman Ilhan Omar married her brother in order to commit immigration fraud.

The congresswoman has denied these claims.

Governor in a KKK robe:

And then there’s Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a man who admitted at a press conference earlier this month that he once wore blackface to a dance contest.

He made this admission after a photo that allegedly showed him and a friend dressed in blackface and a KKK robe went viral and spawned massive backlash and outrage:

Wait, now Northam is saying that it wasn’t him?

Didn’t he apologize for the photo yesterday? ?

I don’t know about y’all, but I think I’d remember putting on blackface.#saturdaymorninghttps://t.co/ZeaSuWWgc1 — Holly Figueroa O’Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) February 2, 2019

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

As Woods duly noted, THIS is the Democrat Party, ladies and gentlemen. Ain’t it beautiful? Not to mention entertaining, hilariously and admittedly somewhat frightening too?

The actor’s followers certainly believe so:

Wow! When you put it all together like that it is utterly shocking…..How does half our country see past all that? I know the press plays a huge role but the shark has been jumped!!!! — Michael John T (@MichaelJohnT) February 17, 2019

That is the question many are asking, after CNN reported that the investigation by Chicago police into Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack has changed.

CBS News reported that, according to a source close to the investigation, the brothers who were arrested last week told police the actor paid them to participate in the alleged attack and that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. The source added that police have evidence to corroborate the sale.

ABC News also reported that the men told police they were paid. The network added that police are trying to corroborate the men's account but they have not been able to independently verify the information.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Sunday afternoon.

The brothers, who are from Nigeria, were also extras on the show. They were released last week without charges, in light of what authorities call “new evidence.” Cops say the brothers are being cooperative.

However, in a statement to multiple outlets, Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson maintain he was the victim of a crime.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continued: “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

On Jan. 29, Smollett said two men attacked him in a Chicago alley, poured a bleach-like substance on him and yelled “MAGA country.”

After the story broke, several messages on social media poured in to support him.

He was also met with messages doubting the whole story.

Last week, Smollett appeared on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" to discuss the alleged incident and refute claims the story was fake.

“I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like OK, we’re getting somewhere,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” Smollett said on the broadcast, referring to the brothers.

""Tom Cruise and the cast were nothing but gracious and professional during filming to all of the sailors,” the official told NBC 7.

At the captain's ""all hands on deck"" call Friday, Cruise took the microphone and personally thanked the crew for their support of the film, the official said.

“Some sailors may have misinterpreted guidance from the Navy that told sailors to not approach actors while filming and not use cell phones on the set,” the official said.

Earlier, a servicemember told NBC 7 that Tom Cruise allegedly told servicemembers on the Roosevelt not to look at or touch him. The person asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

“He angered USS Theodore crew while filming [the 'Top Gun' sequel],” the servicemember told NBC 7 Sunday. They said that Cruise was acting “very arrogant.”

Officials with Naval Air Forces, however, dispute that claim.

A Navy master chief told NBC 7 servicemembers were directed to ""respect"" Cruise and his crew during the movie's filming and that he doesn't believe this was an issue.

He also said the Navy ""does not tolerate any disrespect to its members"" and the Navy ""wouldn't allow"" Cruise to treat staff poorly.

Navy escorts who accompanied Cruise during the shoot said, ""At no time did Tom Cruise say to a sailor, 'Do not look at me. Do not touch me.'”

The allegations that Cruise mistreated servicemembers started on Reddit and were shared on an anti-Scientology website, the Scientology Money Project. Posts on social media, such as Twitter, also have servicemembers alleging other incidents with the actor.

NBC 7 reached out to Cruise's publicist for comment but has not received a reply.

Tom Cruise is in San Diego for the anticipated ""Top Gun"" sequel. NBC 7's Joe Little is at Naval Base Coronado with more.

The sequel to Top Gun is scheduled for release in July.

Editor's Note:

This story was originally published Sunday with one source claiming Tom Cruise mistreated servicemembers on USS Theodore Roosevelt during the filming of Top Gun 2.

Navy officials reached out to NBC 7 after the story was published to give their accounts of events."

The Chicago Police Department has confirmed its interest in interviewing Empire star Jussie Smollett again, following unconfirmed reports that two suspects apprehended by authorities in connection with his attack claimed to have been paid to participate in a hoax.

In a statement to TV Guide, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, ""While we are not in a position to comment, confirm or deny what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in the investigation and we are now interested in speaking to the Empire cast member again. We have been in touch with his attorney and made that request.""

CNN and other outlets previously cited law enforcement sources who claimed Smollett is now suspected of paying two men who were involved in the alleged attack on the actor, which occurred Jan. 29. The reports emerged following the arrest and subsequent release of two men, who are brothers, who were allegedly connected to the incident.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, condemned the reporting in a statement obtained by TV Guide, saying, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

The statement continued, ""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, declined to comment on the reports when reached by TV Guide.

The New York Times reports that the brothers, named Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were detained after arriving on a flight from Nigeria, and their home was raided by police. According to CBS Chicago, several items were seized in the raid, including a script from Empire. One of the brothers had worked as an extra on Empire, and their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, confirmed to the Times that they both knew Smollett.

On Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television addressed reports that the alleged attack against the actor had been staged with Smollett's involvement after he discovered he was to be written off Empire. In a statement, the studio denied any plans to write the actor off the Fox drama, saying, ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him."" Chicago P.D.'s rep also denied those initial reports.

A representative for Smollett told TV Guide Thursday evening that the actor was cooperating with the police investigation. In a statement to Essence earlier this month, Smollett said, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ""

Empire airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Fox.

Smollett reported two men beat him up in Chicago, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic epithets, doused him with an unidentified chemical substance and yelled, “This is MAGA country,” at him in January, TMZ originally reported.

The “Empire” actor confirmed the MAGA country quote in a follow-up interview with police. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett On MAGA Hats: ‘I Never Said That!’)

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Sunday they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.” The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorneys said in their statement.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett’s account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The case gained national attention, with people coming out in support of Smollett and others criticizing the story that has taken several turns.

Here is what we know so far about the case.

Jan. 29: Alleged Attack

Smollett was leaving a Chicago restaurant about 2 a.m. when he was approached by two unknown men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, police said at the time. TMZ reported that one man yelled yelled “Aren’t you that f****** ‘Empire’ n*****?”

After gaining Smollett’s attention, the men punched him and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, police said. At one point during the attack, one of the suspects wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck, according to police. TMZ also reported the substance was bleach and that one of the men yelled “This is MAGA country,” referencing President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make American Great Again.”

TMZ reported at the time that both suspects were white and wearing ski masks.

At the time, Chicago police said in a statement, “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Jan. 31: Persons of Interest

Police showed grainy surveillance pictures of two men dressed in black in Chicago and said they are potential persons of interest. Police said the men appeared to follow Smollett after he left the restaurant at 2 a.m., around the time Smollett said he was attacked.

Another security camera showed Smollett returning home with a rope around his neck.

Smollett's manager told police he was on the phone with his client and heard the attack go down. He said he heard the racial slurs and the shout, “This is MAGA country,” but both Smollett and his manager reportedly refused to hand over their phones to investigators.

Feb. 1: Smollett Publicly Addresses Alleged Attack

Smollett released a statement three days after he said he was attacked. ""I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern I still believe that justice will be served,"" he said.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson also addressed some of the skepticism about Smollett's account of the attack.

Johnson was asked by reporters, “based on the information that detectives have, can you confirm that an attack happened?”

“We don’t have anything that we have been able to view but I will say this, he's a victim right now. And we'll treat him like a victim. He's been very co-operative and we have no reason to think that he is not being genuine with us,” Johnson said.

Johnson added that he hopes the surveillance images will lead to arrests.

Feb. 2: Smollett Performs in Los Angeles

Smollett was showered with love as he appeared at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles. It was his first public appearance since the alleged attack, and he addressed the crowd from the stage.

""There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,"" he said. ""The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m OK ... I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.""

He added, ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. I hope that you all stand with me.""

""I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked. I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalized,"" he said.

He added, ""Above all, I fought the f*** back.""

Feb. 14: Smollett Tells His Story on 'Good Morning America'

Smollett was in tears as he talked about the alleged attack with “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts. He addressed questions being raised about the incident and said he is “pissed off” about being attacked.

“At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh. It's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth,'” Smollett said.

A photo released at the time showed a rope burn on Smollett's neck and a cut and bruise on his cheek.

He said he hoped the attack itself had been caught on a surveillance camera nearby.



“The detective told me the camera inside of the casing was facing north. So they didn’t have it. So that was disappointing,” he said.

As “Good Morning America"" was still on the air, police revealed they were questioning the two ""persons of interest"" caught on surveillance footage.

But then at 7 p.m., police said they were ""investigating ... whether an attack happened at all.""

Feb. 15: Two Men Arrested

On Friday at 8 a.m., police said, ""There is no evidence to say this is a hoax.""

“While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi told the Los Angeles Times in a statement. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.”

Authorities then said they arrested two brothers in connection with Smollett's alleged attack. Police said the men are the shadowy figures caught on surveillance footage.

The men were identified as 25-year-old Abel Osundairo and brother Ola Osundairo, 27, both from Nigeria. They denied any wrongdoing.

""Detectives have probable cause that they may have been involved in an alleged crime and we are working to corroborate the allegations and investigative timeline as our investigation continues,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said in a statement.

Both men have links to Smollett and have appeared as extras on “Empire.”

The brothers flew to Nigeria hours after the alleged attack. They returned to Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Feb. 13, where detectives were waiting for them.

Police searched their apartment in Chicago hours later. A handwritten inventory shows they took away bleach, black face mask, a red hat, an “Empire” script, a laptop and receipts.

Chicago police later tweeted that the men had been released without charges ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations.""

Feb. 17: Brothers Reportedly Tell Police Smollett Paid Them

CBS News reported that, according to a source close to the investigation, the brothers who were arrested last week told police the actor paid them to participate in the alleged attack and that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. The source added that police have evidence to corroborate the sale.

ABC News also reported that the men told police they were paid. The network added that police are trying to corroborate the men's account but they have not been able to independently verify the information.

Several outlets, including the New York Times and the Associated Press, reported that Chicago police's investigation into Smollett's alleged attack “shifted” because of information received from the two brothers.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Sunday afternoon.

However, in a statement to multiple outlets, Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson maintain he was the victim of a crime.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continued: “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

With damning new evidence suggesting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett hired actors to stage an assault so he could present himself as a victim of a racist hate crime by MAGA shouting Trump supporters, his attorneys spoke out.

…to claim that by being busted in the ruse, Smollett is again being victimized.

(Well, the lawyers actually deny the claim, but throwing shade on such reports is their job.)

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a release. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Here is the latest statement from the attorneys that Jussie Smollett has retained: pic.twitter.com/E6L8KytPgy — ????????? ???? (@WashNews) February 17, 2019

Smollett reported — belatedly — that he was beat up by two men, who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck and threw an unidentified liquid on him.

The attackers reportedly yelled, “This is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country.”

In downtown Chicago.

After the incident swept the nation, prompting outcry from the likes of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who is running for president, the story started to fall apart.

The police investigation came to focus on two Nigerian brothers working as extras on Smollett’s TV series. Records show they bought the rope found around Smollett’s neck from a Chicago hardware store on January 25 ― four days before the alleged attack.

The brothers told authorities Smollett paid them $3,500 before they left for Nigeria (hours after the bogus attack on January 29) and were promised an additional $500 upon their return, CBS Chicago reported.

Smollett’s lawyers claimed that one of the “purported suspects” identified is the actor’s personal trainer, making it “impossible to believe that this person played a role.”

It wasn’t so hard to believe the other major player in the story, a liberal media eager to use the incident to tarnish President Trump.

And with the story blowing up in their faces, Mediaite’s John Ziegler wrote that this only serves to help Trump.

“Last night, the dam of media protection for Empire actor Jussie Smollett finally broke, as major news outlets suddenly decided it was safe to report that police strongly believe, backed by evidence, that his story of being a victim of a Trump-motivated hate crime is false,” Ziegler wrote in an op-ed.

He points to the Brett Kavanaugh travesty and the Covington Catholic fiasco, along with the Smollett ruse as stories “where the national news media was too in love with the narrative to even properly examine it.”

All of which results in a further loss of credibility, if that’s possible.

Ziegler took to Twitter to offer the national media some advice.

“Dear Media: Next time you’re baffled about why Trump supporters don’t believe a damn thing you report about the Russia scandal, please think back to how you handled Brett Kavanaugh, “Covington Catholic,” & Jussie Smollett… & then please blame yourself when Trump is re-elected.”

Megyn Kelly had a similar message, though she expressed little confidence that the situation is going to change anytime soon.

“J. Smollett case had plenty of red flags, but media was too attached to storyline (& victimhood) to see/admit them. Once again, journos dedicated more to proving *themselves* virtuous than to reporting facts botch the story,” Kelly tweeted. “It’s tiresome & won’t change.”

A Democratic lawmaker who called the alleged hate crime attack against Jussie Smollett a “modern-day lynching” now says that he is withholding judgement in the case amid reports that authorities believe the “Empire” actor orchestrated a hoax.

“Well, the information is still coming out, and I’m going to withhold until all the information comes out,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters Sunday when asked about his past remarks on the Smollett case.

Booker’s remarks are a far cry from a tweet he posted in the hours after Smollett’s alleged attack was reported.

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker wrote on Jan. 29.

Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two white men who hurled racist and homophobic insults at him while he was walking in Chicago. The actor also claimed that his assailants placed a rope around his neck during the attack.

Democratic lawmakers and left-wing activists jumped to Smollett’s defense. In addition to Booker, California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris called the incident a “modern-day lynching.” New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted it was a “racist, homophobic attack.”

Chicago police now suspect that Smollett paid two acquaintances to stage an attack against him, according to reports from numerous outlets. The two men, who are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, were arrested Wednesday but released from custody Friday. They are reportedly cooperating with investigators.

Instead of backtracking on his earlier comments in the Smollett case, Booker shifted Sunday to a discussion of other hate crimes in the U.S.

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way,” Booker told reporters.

Asked whether Smollett should comment publicly in the face of new information in the case, Booker said: “Again, I’m following this case as you are. We’ll see this happen.”

Booker was also asked whether Smollett’s apparent hoax undercuts an anti-lynching bill that the Democrat introduced earlier this week.

Booker dodged the question.

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

“We have seen painful realities surge in our country, a rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks,” he said. “We’re seeing just vicious, horrific, cruel violence that’s motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all neighborhoods and communities are safe.”

A grand jury will hear the Jussie Smollett case early next week ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.

Law enforcement sources connected to the investigation tell TMZ, the 2 brothers who were arrested and then released are staying somewhere around the Loop in downtown Chicago under the watchful eye of police so no one gets to them. We're told cops especially want to make sure Jussie does not contact the brothers.

We're told when police raided the home of the 2 brothers they found magazines with pages torn out, and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to Jussie 8 days before the alleged attack.

Our sources say early on they asked Jussie if he'd sign complaints against the 2 men who attacked him and he was clear that he would. But, when he found out the 2 brothers were the ones in custody we're told he said he knew them, felt bad for them and declined to sign the complaints.

Our sources say although cops believe the brothers purchased the rope that was around Jussie's neck after the incident, there is no surveillance video at the hardware store because it erases after a week.

We're told the way they tracked the 2 brothers down was by their movements in arriving and leaving the scene around Jussie's apartment building. As we reported, they left in either a cab or a rideshare, but we're told cops tracked the vehicle and the 2 brothers got out on their way home and into another vehicle. As one source put it, ""It was almost like a bad spy movie.""

The sources say there were red flags from the get-go. Cops were extremely suspicious when Jussie took them out to the area where he said he was attacked and pointed to an obscure camera saying how happy he was that the attack was on video. Turns out the camera was pointing in the wrong direction. Cops thought it was weird he knew the location of that camera.

And, there's this. We're told investigators didn't believe the 2 alleged attackers screamed, ""This is MAGA country,"" because, ""Not a single Trump supporter watches 'Empire.'""

And, a few loose ends ... we're told when cops picked up the 2 brothers at O'Hare Airport, police were armed with 3 warrants for each man, one of which was to seize their phones.

We're also told there is no video of a ""rehearsal"" of the attack in the street."

Amid music from video games and the ringing of pinball machines and the sound of cans of domestic and craft beers cracking open, Booker talked policy with local Democrats at a ""barcade"" in Manchester, New Hampshire.

""I have done events in basements, I have done house parties, I have done union halls,"" Booker said as he surveyed the colorful arcade cabinets lined up behind him, including Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat. ""I have never done a barcade.""

That didn't stop Booker from trying his hand at a number of games, including a newer, four-player Pac-Man game, and a vintage arcade game - Q(asterisk)bert- after taking questions for a half-hour.

Old games mixed with newer ones. Reflecting on the nostalgia, Booker said he saw his childhood ""beckoning him back"" and that he would challenge ""anybody in the Senate to any of these games.""

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren described a squeeze on working families as she made her first appearance before Nevada voters since declaring her candidacy.

Warren reminded the crowd in Las Vegas on Sunday of her work a decade ago monitoring the bailout of banks during the financial crisis and how it brought her to the gaming city to witness the epicenter of the mortgage crisis.

The Massachusetts senator told the crowd how her own family almost lost their home when she was growing up and described Washington, D.C., as a place that works well for corporations and lobbyists but not families.

She also spoke about strengthening unions and passing comprehensive immigration reform. Both are big issues in Nevada, which has politically powerful labor organizations and a population that's about 29 percent Latino.

Sen. Cory Booker, who called the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett a ""modern-day lynching"" after the actor reported it, is withholding judgment on reports alleging Smollett is under investigation for possible involvement in his own assault.

Booker told reporters after meeting with hundreds of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, that he would reserve judgment ""until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources.""

The Democratic presidential candidate turned his focus back to combating hate crimes broadly. Booker called for a unified pushback against ""attacks on people because they're different.""

The Chicago Police Department is acknowledging that the Smollett case has ""shifted"" after ruling out two potential suspects. Smollett's attorneys have denied reports of his potential involvement in the alleged attack and said he will cooperate with police.

The first Republican to move toward a primary challenge against President Donald Trump plans to campaign on what he calls Trump's reckless spending and lack of preparation in helping workers shift to jobs in a more automated economy.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld tells ABC's ""This Week"" that Trump is racking up $1 trillion a year in debt that will crush taxpayers.

Weld says the government should be preparing workers to shift to jobs in ""artificial intelligence and robotics and drones and machine learning and autonomous vehicles.""

But he says policymakers aren't paying attention to that because ""they're so busy with divisiveness and trying to make everyone feel awful.""

Weld announced on Friday that he was forming an exploratory committee for president.

Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker is greeting hundreds of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, as he starts the second day in a weekend swing through the state that will hold the first primary next year.

The New Jersey senator is promoting his work on criminal justice legislation. Booker played an important role in shaping the bipartisan deal to overhaul federal sentencing and prison laws, working with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.

Booker says he could write a ""dissertation"" on his general disagreements with Grassley, but says the two were able to find common ground. The criminal justice deal was backed by President Donald Trump. He signed it into law in December.

8:20 a.m.

Democratic presidential candidates are courting voters in states with influential early roles in the 2020 primary as the busy pace of campaigning over the holiday weekend shows that the contest to challenge President Donald Trump is fully underway.

The brisk pace of the candidates' stops Sunday in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada points to the up-for-grabs state of the race in its early stages. And Congress' Presidents Day recess gives the senators already running some extra time to promote their agendas.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is continuing his swing through New Hampshire. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (KLOH'-buh-shar) of Minnesota is set to visit Iowa. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts plans to be in Nevada, the first Western state to vote in the primary.

The trajectory of the investigation ""shifted"" after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett's attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

""We're not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we've gotten,"" he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Pamela Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates ""as of now."" Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, later said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett's lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt ""victimized"" by reports that he played a role in the assault, adding that, ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" The statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored area where Smollett said the attack occurred but were unable to find any footage of the incident. They did obtain images of two people they said they would like to question.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer, whom the actor hired to help get him physically ready for a music video, Smollett's attorneys said in their statement.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media from some politicians and celebrities. Smollett's account of what happened also has been met with skepticism, particularly in the wake of the latest developments.

Smollett, who is also a musician, gave an emotional speech during a Feb. 2 concert in West Hollywood, California, saying he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

He also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday in which he said he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" Jamal Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Sunday they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

CHICAGO (AP) — Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the ""Empire"" actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers said: ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.

Chicago police earlier Saturday said their investigation of the attack had ""shifted"" following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released from police custody Friday without being charged.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett's attorneys say that one of the men was the actor's personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!""

You can see Booker’s response below:

Booker first made it clear that he’s not ready to weigh in on the complex case yet. Then he shifted gear to talk about the problem of hate crimes and bias crimes in the United States; Booker said that bias crimes are on the rise in America, and said that since 911, there has been an uptick in white supremacist attacks on US soil. Here is his response, as told to the AP:

“Well, the information is still coming out. I’m going to withhold it until all of the information actually comes out from on the record sources. We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way. We actually even know in this country, that since 911 the majority of attacks on our soil have been right wing terrorist attacks, the majority of them white supremacist attacks — from the horrific shootings in Pittsburgh, or in South Carolina church, what we’re seeing is attacks on people because they’re different. And we all need to join together and condemn those attacks, and the hatred and the bigotry that sources them.”

Jussie Smollett, the star of TV’s Empire, told police that he was attacked by two unknown men in Chicago, on January 29. Smollett said his attackers yelled out homophobic and racial slurs, put a rope around his neck, and poured a chemical on him. There was a national outcry after Smollett reported the attack. Cory Booker called the event a “modern day lynching” at the time.

But more recently, police in Chicago say that they have new information which has “shifted” the way they’re investigating the case. CBS has reported that — according to off-the-record sources — Booker paid two brothers to “stage” the attack against him. CNN also cites unnamed sources who say that the actor arranged to have the attack on him staged. In a statement issued by his attorneys, Smollett denied having anything to do with his attack."

We’re gonna have a party.

Lionel Richie once sang that in his hit “All Night Long,” and it applies to the 23rd annual Keep Memory Alive Power of Love gala set for March 16 at MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Power of Love gala, which benefits the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, will this year honor Richie, who turns 70 on June 19.

Committed to this year’s event are hip-hop, R&B star and “World of Dance” judge Ne-Yo, fellow Grammy Award-winning artist Miguel, jazz-guitar great and ex-New York Yankee legend Bernie Williams, singer-songwriter-actress Leona Lewis and keyboard great Greg Phillinganes.

“Empire” co-star Jussie Smollett, who is also a singer-songwriter, remains on the official list, despite allegations that he might have orchestrated a racially motivated attack late last month in Chicago. Power of Love organizers are tracking this fluid, and also odd, turn of events.

Richie most recently headlined at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood from 2016-2018 and has performed intermittently in Las Vegas since the late-1970s as a member of the Commodores. He’s the latest in the long line of entertainment luminaries to appear at the event.

Over the years, Power of Love has drawn such superstars as Tony Bennett, Andrea Bocelli with Celine Dion, Bono, Michael Bublé, Jennifer Hudson, Snoop Dogg, Cee Lo Green, Enrique Iglesias, Jon Bon Jovi, LL Cool J, Lenny Kravitz, Barry Manilow and Stevie Wonder.

The show welcomes culinary icons, too: Wolfgang Puck of Spago and Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, the NoMad Hotel in New York and Los Angeles and the recently opened Las Vegas resort at the Park MGM.

The event raises funds for the Ruvo Center’s ongoing fight against neurocognitive diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, multiple-system atrophy, frontotemporal dementia and related disorders and multiple sclerosis.

“Brain disease does not belong to the patients alone, but their entire families. A caregiver’s job is 24/7, 365 days a year,” Keep Memory Alive vice-chairwoman and co-founder Camille Ruvo said in a statement. “We are honored to welcome these incredible artists to the lineup for this year’s Power of Love gala, which allows us to fund the remarkable work being done at Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.”

Lou Ruvo, the inspiration of the clinic, died of Alzheimer’s 25 years ago Monday.

The event is again presenting its Keep Memory Alive Caregiver Hero Award, honoring Lonnie Ali, widow and caregiver of the late Muhammad Ali. The award pays tribute to those who have gone above and beyond to care for those who are unable to care for themselves. Ali was honored at the 2011 event celebrating his 70th birthday.

Cory Booker declined on Sunday to comment directly on reports that police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to carry out a hoax assault on himself last month.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked in late January by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault on him.

Booker, who is running for president, was one of several Democrats to weigh in on the initial reports of the attack on Smollett, tweeting that it was “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

Asked as he campaigned in New Hampshire about the recent reports that the attack was a hoax, Booker said, “I’m going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources.”

In a statement on Saturday night, Smollett’s attorneys said the actor denies playing a role in the attack. “(Smollett) has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement read. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

In his response, Booker, who has pushed to make lynching a federal hate crime, pointed to recorded increases in hate crimes in the US.

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way,” Booker said. “We actually even know in this country that since 9/11 a majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right wing terrorist attacks, a majority of them white supremacist attacks.”

He reiterated his point in response to another question, continuing to call for further action to combat bigotry and violence.

“We have seen painful realities surge in our country, a rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks,” Booker said. “We’re seeing just a vicious, horrific, cruel violence that’s motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all neighborhoods and communities are safe.”

The FBI said in a December report that from 2016 to 2017 hate crime incidents reported to the FBI rose 17%."

JUSSIE Smollett allegedly promised to pay two friends $4000 ($A5600) to stage his racist and homophobic assault - which the trio even rehearsed beforehand, according to a new report.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a ""f****t,"" ""n****r"" and yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown ""chemical substance.""

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects - but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a ""relationship"" with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is ""angered and devastated"" by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement said.

Sources allege that the two men . Picture: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

""It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,"" Trump Jr. wrote.

US President Donald Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as ""horrible.""

“Well, the information is still coming out, and I’m going to withhold until all the information comes out,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters Sunday when asked about his past remarks on the Smollett case.

Booker’s remarks are a far cry from a tweet he posted in the hours after Smollett’s alleged attack was reported.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker wrote on Jan. 29.

On Sunday, Booker didn’t sound nearly as sure.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, claimed that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two white men who hurled racist and homophobic insults at him while he was walking in Chicago.

The actor also claimed that his assailants placed a rope around his neck during the attack.

Democratic lawmakers and left-wing activists jumped to Smollett’s defense.

In addition to Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all Democrats, called the alleged assault on Smollett a “lynching.”

Chicago police now suspect that Smollett paid two acquaintances to stage an attack against him, according to reports from numerous outlets.

The two men, who are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, were arrested Wednesday but released from custody Friday. They are reportedly cooperating with investigators.

Instead of backtracking on his earlier comments in the Smollett case, Booker shifted Sunday to a discussion of other hate crimes in the U.S.

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way,” Booker told reporters.

Asked whether Smollett should comment publicly in the face of new information in the case, Booker said: “Again, I’m following this case as you are. We’ll see this happen.”

Booker was also asked whether Smollett’s apparent hoax undercuts an anti-lynching bill that the Democrat introduced earlier this week.

Booker dodged the question.

“We have seen painful realities surge in our country, a rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks,” he said.

“We’re seeing just vicious, horrific, cruel violence that’s motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all neighborhoods and communities are safe.”

Cory Booker declined on Sunday to comment directly on reports that police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to carry out a hoax assault on himself last month.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked in late January by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault on him.

Booker, who is running for president, was one of several Democrats to weigh in on the initial reports of the attack on Smollett, tweeting that it was ""an attempted modern-day lynching.""

Asked as he campaigned in New Hampshire about the recent reports that the attack was a hoax, Booker said, ""I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources.""

In a statement on Saturday night, Smollett's attorneys said the actor denies playing a role in the attack.

Below is a timeline of the events beginning with Smollett’s original claims of being assaulted by men with a noose and a bleach-like liquid on January 29 at 2 AM on the below-freezing, snow-covered streets of Chicago.

January 29

Smollett was hospitalized after an attack described by the Chicago Police Department as a possibly “racially-charged assault and battery.”

Smollett alleged that his attackers asked him, “Aren’t you that faggot Empire nigger?”

TMZ reported on Smollett’s claims at the time:

The 2 men — both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Chicago police claimed via statement:

Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime. Detectives are currently working to gather video, identify potential witnesses and establish an investigative timeline.

Empire creator and producer Lee Daniels derided American in his acceptance of Smollett’s claims as prima facie, describing them as “just another fucking day in America.”

View this post on Instagram We got this @jussiesmollett A post shared by Lee Daniels (@theoriginalbigdaddy) on Jan 29, 2019 at 10:55am PST

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), accepted Smollett’s claims at face value while blaming President Donald Trump for the alleged attack:

The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling. The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric. It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk. We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker called for an “anti-lynching” bill to be passed in Congress while referencing Smollett’s claims.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) accepted Smollett’s claims while blaming Trump:

But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked? It’s coming from the President of the United States. He’s dog-whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way, maybe never said and never talked about it, never could act it out, but now they’re on it.

Presidential hopeful and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) accepted Smollett’s claims as true, describing the alleged attack as a “modern day lynching.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) framed Smollett’s accusations as accurate, characterizing the alleged attack as “racist” and “homophobic.”

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

Former Vice President Joe Biden cast Smollett’s charges as authentic, criticizing “homophobia” and “racism.”

What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

Local law enforcement reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage, finding no evidence to corroborate Smollett’s claims.

CNN reported on the Chicago police’s inability to substantiate Smollett’s accusations:

In a place so far with a high number of private surveillance cameras, they cannot find any images of the two alleged attackers. After combing through hundreds of hours of videos, the only image of Smollett police obtained from security cameras was inside the Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime — and he was standing alone.

Chicago police requested the city’s help in finding persons of interest related to the alleged attack on Smollett, issuing a “community alert” towards such an end.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel framed Smollett’s claims as legitimate during a press conference. “Obviously the alleged statement of what happened here is horrific and there’s no place for it in the city of Chicago,” he said.

Brandon Moore, Smollett’s manager, told investigators he heard the alleged assault on Smollett, claiming to have been in a phone conversation with Smollett at the time.

However, detectives are unable to ""independently verify"" the call occurred because Smollett refused to turn over his phone. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

January 31

One of Smollett’s neighbors claimed she saw a white male — who she described as a “redneck” — near her and Smollett’s apartment complex about 90 minutes before the alleged attack.

Breitbart News reported:

[Smollett’s neighbor told TMZ] she saw the man pacing between the building’s entrance and parking garage while she walked her dog at around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. According to Smollett’s neighbor, the man appeared agitated and “out of place” as he puffed on a cigarette. She said he was a white male with “scruff on his face” wearing a blue winter hat, a blue hoodie, and jeans. The alleged assailant also wore “thick, grey hunting socks,” which the neighbor said she could see because his jeans were ill-fitted, along with “camel-colored” shoes.

Smollett’s family described the alleged attack as “domestic terrorism” via statement.

Smollett refused to turn over his mobile phone to investigators, according to Chicago police.

February 1

Smollett repeated his claims, telling Essence magazine via statement:

Let me start by saying that I’m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

Dozens gathered in New York City, NY, for a rally against what its organizers described as a “racist” and “anti-LGBTQ political agenda” related to Smollett’s claims.

The rally’s lead organizer chanted, “When queer communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back. When people of color are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.”

Via statement to BET, Smollett’s family assessed the claimed attack on their relative as a “racial and homophobic hate crime.”

February 2

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win,” said Smollett while performing on stage in Los Vegas, NV. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) was in attendance.

Actor and singer Jussie Smollett returned to the stage in Los Angeles and performed in front of a crowd at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, filmmaker Lee Daniels, and actor Wilson Cruz, where among the audience. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win,” Smollett said.

“I have so many words on my heart,” Jussie Smollett said. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay. I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.”

February 13

“Jussie is the victim here,” claimed Smollett’s representatives via statement.

Smollett cried in an interview with ABC while recounting his allegations, shown in a teaser preview video.

In the ABC interview, Smollett said he was “pissed off” at people who do disbelieve his allegations, deriding such persons as unwilling to “see the truth.” He said:

It’s like, you know, at first it was a thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then, that’s it, because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how can you not believe that? It’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth. You don’t even want to see the truth.

Smollett further disparaged skeptics of his claims, “It feels like, if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more–a lot more.”

Smollett said he was politically targeted because of his opposition to Trump, “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue.”

February 14

A reported emerged that two persons of interest in the alleged attack are of Nigerian descent and appeared on Empire as extras.

Chicago police began investigating the possibility of Smollett staging the attack as a hoax.

ABC’s Chicago affiliate reported:

Multiple sources have told ABC7 Eyewitness News that police are investigating whether Smollett and the two men staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of “Empire.” A source familiar with the investigation told the ABC7 I-Team that Smollett failed to appear for an interview with detectives earlier Thursday.

February 15

Chicago police raid the home of two of the two aforementioned men — both Empire extras — of Nigerian descent and detain them.

The two Empire Extras are later revealed to be Nigerian bodybuilders affiliated with Smollett.

Smollett secured legal representation from Michel Monico, who also represents Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen.

February 16

Chicago police suspect Smollett or paying the two Nigerian Empire extras of setting up the attack as a false flag “hate crime” hoax.

Smollett’s lawyers maintain that he has been truthful.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, Smollett’s lawyers, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Facebook will apparently not allow its users to say that police believe Smollett, a black gay actor, may have paid his two “assailants” to attack him last month, and blamed it on white Trump supporters — this, even though that is being reported by multiple national media outlets.

A friend posted this on his Facebook account:

The link below on my wall is to Rod Dreher’s blog post that has been blocked by FB for “violating community standards,” if you can believe it. So, what I did was create a tiny url of it just to see how long it stays up. If FB blocks it, I am outta here, and I hope some of you will join me. The type of soft totalitarianism that this company employs in order to silence dissent runs counter to the underlying purpose of communication: to speak and learn the truth. That, of course, means that we may stumble once and a while, which is what I have done on occasion. However, as long as we welcome correction and issue it with charity to others, we all benefit. FB, by short-circuiting that process in the name of protecting a particular “narrative,” harms us all. Growth, whether spiritual or intellectual, sometimes requires that we hear and see things that not only challenge our cherished beliefs, but cause us real emotional pain. To try to purposely avoid such incidents is to advance the cause of ignorant docility. It is at bottom, paradoxically, inhumane.

Facebook did, in fact, block his tiny url link to my comment.

I didn’t much use my Facebook account, so it wasn’t a big deal to delete it, which I did this morning after seeing what Team Zuckerberg did. I invite all of you to consider what it means when Facebook will prevent its users from discussing facts and drawing conclusions that do not reflect well on preferred progressive narratives.

I fully support Facebook or any other social medium having a policy of banning certain material (porn, neo-Nazi propaganda, etc.). But when you can’t talk about hate hoaxes in general, or about a celebrated hate hoax in particular? Presumably my blog post violated Facebook’s “hate speech” prohibition (I can’t find any of their other Community Standards that it might have violated). Facebook’s policy on “hate speech” is here. This, I suppose, is what my blog post violated:

But the entire reason for the post is new evidence indicating that Jussie Smollett was NOT a victim of a hate crime, but rather faked a hate crime!

Just after typing that line, the same friend who sent out the tiny url blocked by Facebook texted to say that Facebook is no longer blocking my Jussie Smollett post. If true, that’s good news — but the fact that FB blocked it in the first place is a very troubling sign. I’m not going to reinstate my account. I’m done with Facebook."

Smollett insists he was the victim of an anti-gay and anti-black hate crime in Chicago, claiming two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck while using slurs and the term ""MAGA,"" short for President Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again.""

The actor on the five-season Fox musical drama ""Empire"" said the attack was an unprovoked assault by a pair of white men and publicly surmised it was motivated by his criticism of Trump.

Police detained and later released without charges two black brothers from Nigeria this week upon their return to the U.S. The local CBS affiliate reports they are believed to have purchased items used in the attack, which they allegedly rehearsed with Smollett.

The brothers, who flew to Nigeria hours after the alleged Jan. 29 attack, reportedly were paid $3,500 before their departure and were promised by Smollett another $500 upon their return.

In a statement, the Chicago police said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the 'Empire' cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett appeared on ""Good Morning America"" Thursday to rebut allegations the hate crime was a hoax.

""You don't even want to see the truth,"" Smollett said about doubters. ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more — a lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now. The fact that we have these fear mongrels [sic], these people that are trying to separate us.""

Smollett also said he never told police the men whom he claims attacked him were wearing ""MAGA"" hats. “I didn’t need to add anything like that,” he said. “I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”





Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, put out a statement Saturday evening, saying the actor has been ""further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

It’s one of two fatal crashes that occurred over the weekend in Maine.

The service says the crash that killed Troy Marden, a senior and star football player at Amesbury High School, occurred on Thompson Lake in Portland just before 11 p.m. Saturday.

The service says two snowmobiles were operating on a plowed portion of the lake when the snowmobile operated by Marden failed to negotiate a corner and hit a snowbank.

Wardens say the operator of the other snowmobile tried to assist Marden before getting help.

Marden was pronounced dead at the scene.

His family is asking for privacy at this time but some people who knew him are remembering him as a ""kind soul.""

Marden's football number 48 was honored on the school's Facebook page Sunday night, where photos highlighted his high school career.

Classmates and parents left heartfelt condolences, as well as prayers for Marden's family.

As the Amesbury High School community grieves, many are still in shock after being stunned by the news of his death.

In a message sent to families in the Amesbury school district, Superintendent Jared Fulgoni called Marden's death a ""tragic loss to our school community.""

""We are deeply saddened by our loss, and our thoughts and prayers are with Troy’s family and friends,"" the message read.

Stating that Marden's death is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for the entire school community, Fulgoni says Amesbury Public Schools has a team of professionals prepared to help with the needs of students, parents, and school personnel.

Counselors will be available Monday at the Amesbury High School cafeteria from 1 to 4 p.m. for anyone who needs support.

The warden service is also investigating another snowmobile crash that resulted in a death on a Norway lake Saturday. The service says that crash killed 52-year-old Gracie Herrick Onofrio of Norway.

The accident happened just after 3:30 p.m. on Pennesseewassee Lake.

Wardens say a snowmobile hit the snowbanks of a plowed road on the lake, sending the vehicle airborne and throwing Onofrio from the snowmobile.

A second snowmobile from the party then struck Onofrio, officials said.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The service reminds all snowmobile operators to be mindful of their surroundings and manage their speed, especially with snowmobile traffic increasing during vacation week."

JUSSIE Smollett allegedly promised to pay two friends $4000 ($A5600) to stage his racist and homophobic assault - which the trio even rehearsed beforehand, according to a new report.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a ""f****t,"" ""n****r"" and yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown ""chemical substance.""

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects - but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a “f****t,” “n****r” and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown “chemical substance.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects — but then released on Friday without charges.

Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert last month, the actress took particular aim at Pence over his long-held opposition to same-sex marriage.

“The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love with my wife,” Ellen Page explained. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they’re going to kill themselves, and people are going to be beaten on the street.”

The 31-year-old, who came out as a lesbian in 2014, also blasted the media for questioning Smollett’s version of events.

“I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this,” she said tearfully. “This needs to fucking stop.”

“The urgency is so severe. But instead, we have a media that’s barely talking about it,” the Juno star ranted. We have a media that says it’s a debate that whether or not what happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It’s absurd. It’s not a fucking debate.”

Smollett, who is both black and gay, last month claimed he was the victim of a hate crime attack by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs, telling police they looped a rope around his neck, doused him in an unidentified chemical substance and shouted “This is MAGA country!” before fleeing the scene.

Yet on Saturday evening, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz reported that Chicago Police now believe that “Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault,” adding that the “the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

Page’s interview currently has over 16.7 million views on Twitter, as well as a further 1.4 million views on YouTube. She has yet to publicly comment on the case’s latest development.

Smollett had previously claimed that at 2am in downtown Chicago, he was attacked by two men, had a rope wrapped around his neck, and chemicals thrown on him and claimed he was called racial and homophobic slurs. He also said that the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country!” at him.

Left-wing Hollywood, of course, used the alleged attack to cast blame on President Trump and the United States in general.

Empire co-creator Lee Daniels said, “We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist fuck can come in and do the things that they did to you.”

“Hold your head up, Jussie. I’m with you. I’ll be there in a minute. It’s just another fucking day in America,” he said.

Weiner began a 21-month sentence in November 2017 for sexting a 15-year-old girl and will be released from federal custody on May 14, TMZ reported.

The 54-year-old convicted former congressman is currently in a pre-release stage and has been transferred from the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts to a New York Bureau of Prisons residential re-entry center and is either in a halfway house or home confinement, according to TMZ.

It was announced in October that Weiner would be released three months early on account of good behaviour.

After his official release, Weiner will reportedly spend three years on supervised release and will have to pay a $US10,000 fine as well as register as a sex offender.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

NBC News quoted Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi as saying the course of the investigation has changed.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” Guglielmi said.

Two men regarded as “persons of interest” were released without charges Friday night after they were questioned by police.

Guglielmi posted on Twitter Friday “new evidence” came to light during their interrogations with the men and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.

NBC News and the Chicago Tribune cited unnamed law-enforcement sources as saying police are investigating whether Smollett paid the brothers to help him stage the attack.

Smollett, 35, was hospitalized Jan. 29 after he said two unknown men in Chicago attacked him while he was walking and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

The actor told police the offenders poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene."

During CNN’s Reliable Sources on Sunday, libertarian commentator and podcaster Kmele Foster called out folks in the media for their “rush to judgment” based on their preconceived notions of Trump supporters.

Host Brian Stelter put off the Smollett story until after the first commercial break, choosing instead to bemoan President Trump’s “distractions” from other stories about his administration.

When they finally got around to Smollett, Foster was up first and immediately pointed out that “there were a lot of reasons for skepticism from very, very early on here.” After noting the “rush to judgment”, he explained where that bias came from: “I think in a lot of speculative controversies where the media is necessarily reporting on a story really, really early when we don't know much, folks have to go with what we suppose. And what we knew at the time was the President’s supporters are racist.”

“My heart goes out to anyone who gets attacked, but it's totally appropriate to exercise a bit of skepticism and exercise a bit of patience in waiting for the facts to develop around this story. And as they have developed, this story looks very different than what most people suspected,” Foster added after pointing out some of Smollett’s unbelievable claims.

Next up was Vox Media host Liz Plank, who was ready to spread fake news to defend the liberal media from themselves. Regarding the media’s rush to push Smollett’s claim the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country” and a report about them supposedly MAGA hats, Plank suggested that it wasn’t part of the story for legitimate outlets:

I mean, the MAGA quote, I remember reading about this story and looking for a real reputable media outlet reporting on that, and I could not find one. Right? The people who were repeating that quote were not news outlets, were not media outlets. It was repeated by, sure, people who maybe had good intentions of wanting to spread the story and had empathy for what they thought was a real story. But we can't confuse celebrity tweets with the media and the press.

But that’s just a lie. As the NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck reported on January 29, MSNBC was on-air with the accusations shortly after they broke. They were even spreading the claim about the MAGA hats, which was quickly debunked by the Chicago Police Department. Later that evening, ABC’s World News Tonight also pounced on the MAGA quote.

Interestingly, Vox’s one and only report on the Smollett case (from January 29) didn’t use the word “alleged” (or any skeptical language) to describe the attack. Vox described the attack as a matter of fact and has yet to update the story with any of the developments.

Things actually got a little bit heated between Foster and Plank when they spared over the frequency of “hate crimes” (click “expand” to read):

PLANK: Exactly. It is different. And we don't know what happened to Jussie, but what we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country. Homophobia is alive and well in this country. 2017, the U.S. set a record for the number of hate crimes and the President and his rhetoric has been cited by people who -- there is real evidence of people who have done the crimes who cite that the President has inspired them. STELTER: But is that why people just went ahead and believed? [Crosstalk] FOSTER: This might be part of the problem here. I think this is part of the problem. We're establishing the trend whether or not it’s there. PLANK: We’re not establishing it, there’s evidence of it. FOSTER: When you say like “it's alive and well”, there is far less racism in America today than there has been. PLANK: There has been an increase in hate crimes against the LGBTQ community, and against Muslims, against black people. FOSTER: When we talk about hate crimes, we’re talking about 15 percent increases in these things. PLANK: So what? It’s an increase. FOSTER: A hate crime is not the sort of thing we simply look at and it is absolutely positively a hate crime. There's some supposition about that. PLANK: So, you don’t believe the FBI? The FBI is not an expert? You’re an expert? FOSTER: I’m saying there's some supposition about hate crime. Define hate crime. Define hate speech. PLANK: That’s why I leave it to the FBI, to the experts on it. FOSTER: And I’m suggesting that even the FBI statistics; there's a great deal of ambiguity about what makes something a hate crime. There are subjective determinations there. PLANK: What makes those ambiguous is that most don’t get reported so there are actually more.

After their sharing, CNN media analyst Bill Carter bizarrely suggested that the media didn’t have an opportunity to question Smollett despite ABC’s interview with him. “Instead of what really happened, it was not a news interview. He didn't do a news interview. The media was not able to really question him closely about this. And when they did, his story started to fall apart because it was full of red flags.”

But they did have that chance and ABC blew it. As Carter noted, ABC treated it like a “celebrity interview more than a news person interview.” But, as this author noted on Thursday, even as it became increasingly clear that something was fishy, ABC was still carrying water for him.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

The Chicago Police Department has confirmed its interest in interviewing Empire star Jussie Smollett again, following unconfirmed reports that two suspects apprehended by authorities in connection with his attack claimed to have been paid to participate in a hoax.

In a statement to TV Guide, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, ""While we are not in a position to comment, confirm or deny what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in the investigation and we are now interested in speaking to the Empire cast member again. We have been in touch with his attorney and made that request.""

CNN and other outlets previously cited law enforcement sources who claimed Smollett is now suspected of paying two men who were involved in the alleged attack on the actor, which occurred Jan. 29. The reports emerged following the arrest and subsequent release of two men, who are brothers, who were allegedly connected to the incident.

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, condemned the reporting in a statement obtained by TV Guide, saying, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

The statement continued, ""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, declined to comment on the reports when reached by TV Guide.

The New York Times reports that the brothers, named Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were detained after arriving on a flight from Nigeria, and their home was raided by police. According to CBS Chicago, several items were seized in the raid, including a script from Empire. One of the brothers had worked as an extra on Empire, and their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, confirmed to the Times that they both knew Smollett.

On Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television addressed reports that the alleged attack against the actor had been staged with Smollett's involvement after he discovered he was to be written off Empire. In a statement, the studio denied any plans to write the actor off the Fox drama, saying, ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him."" Chicago P.D.'s rep also denied those initial reports.

A representative for Smollett told TV Guide Thursday evening that the actor was cooperating with the police investigation. In a statement to Essence earlier this month, Smollett said, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ""

Empire airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Fox.

JUSSIE Smollett allegedly promised to pay two friends $4000 ($A5600) to stage his racist and homophobic assault - which the trio even rehearsed beforehand, according to a new report.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a ""f****t,"" ""n****r"" and yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown ""chemical substance.""

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects - but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a ""relationship"" with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is ""angered and devastated"" by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement said.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

""It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,"" Trump Jr. wrote.

US President Donald Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as ""horrible.""

Smollett claimed the beat down was provoked by his public comments against Mr Trump.

After the latest developments, members of the Chi PD have been trying to determine if Jussie is actually the victim or a suspect who orchestrated his attack. As we reported, the two Nigerian men — who were considered suspects, were released without charges after providing key evidence in the attack. Reports stated that Jussie paid $3,000 each to stage the attack and even rehearsed it. However, the actor’s Lawyer has denied any of those claims and made it clear that Jussie is the victim here.

TMZ reached out to Chi PD and asked what’s the status of the “Empire” star. They said,

“We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question. After new developments, we’ve reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.”

Following the latest reports claiming Jussie rehearsed his attack, his lawyer made a statement to the public, saying,

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a ""f****t,"" ""n****r"" and yelled ""This is MAGA country!"" before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown ""chemical substance.""

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects - but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a ""relationship"" with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

Smollett's lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is ""angered and devastated"" by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement said.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

""It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,"" Trump Jr. wrote.

US President Donald Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as ""horrible.""

Smollett claimed the beat down was provoked by his public comments against Mr Trump.

The fire started around 6:15 a.m. on the northbound side of I-91 between exits 23 and 24, according to police.

The truck was carrying 9,000 gallons of gasoline, which fueled the fire for several hours.

Because of the size of the fire and the intensity of the flames, firefighters kept at a distance and let the fire burn until it started to diminish.

""We were able to get foam onto it after it had burned down to the point where it was controllable,"" said Frank Kelley, of the Rocky Hill Fire Department.

Nearby homes were evacuated due to the amount of smoke. Those residents were able to go to Rocky Hill High School to stay warm, police said.

No one was injured in the fire.

The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection also responded to the scene to monitor contamination to the soil and nearby waterways.

""We do have impact to a stream tributary to the Connecticut River. We have booms in place there to try and contain that stream,"" Jeff Chandler, of DEEP, said.

Days after calling reports that Jussie Smollett staged his own attack “inaccurate,” Chicago police now say the focus of the investigation has changed.

According to Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi, new “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo were arrested in connection with the case on February 13 but released without charges after two days of questioning. CNN is reporting that Chicago police now believe Smollett paid the brothers to stage the January 29 attack, wherein he reported being beaten by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, had a rope tied around his neck, and was soaked with a chemical substance. Sources connected to the Chicago Police Department told CNN that records prove the men purchased the rope.

In a tweet, Guglielmi said that the questioning has yielded “new evidence” and “detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”



Defense attorney Michael Monico, who has also represented former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, announced on Friday he is now representing Smollett, according to Variety. Lawyers for Smollett have released the following statement:"

The sources said records showed the two brothers purchased the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a Chicago hardware store.

The Nigerian brothers were released Friday after getting arrested for suspicion of assault and battery.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” a statement from CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation, said.

“We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

In a Twitter post on Thursday, Guglielmi said media reports claiming the attack was a hoax were “unconfirmed” and the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Smollett told police he was a victim of a racist and anti-gay attack.

A source who has knowledge of the bookings for “Good Morning America” (GMA) said Smollett was adamant he wanted to be interviewed on the show.

The source claimed Smollett shouted that he needed to be on television right away. The actor felt it was his duty, as a gay African American man, to interview immediately because society needed to hear his story. Continuing, the unnamed source addressed the incident involving Kim Kardashian and how she was a victim of a Paris burglary. Kardashian was so shaken by the incident, interviews were refused for months.

During Smollett’s Feb. 14 interview on “GMA”, he was tearful while discussing the attack. Smollett described how he was beaten on his head by two strangers who shouted: “This is MAGA country.”

Smollet claims on Jan. 29 two white men wearing ski masks attacked him, beating his head. They also poured an unknown chemical substance on him and put a noose around his neck.

It was later found that Smollett paid two extras from the “Empire” television show he appeared on to stage the assault. It was later revealed that the attack was rehearsed several days prior to the event.

Just a few days after the liberal media were burned by the hoax that was the claims against the Covington Kids, the liberal media proved they didn’t learn a lesson by running right back to the stove to ultimately get burned by the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax. During CNN’s Reliable Sources on Sunday, libertarian commentator and podcaster Kmele Foster called out folks in the media for their “rush to judgment” based on their preconceived notions of Trump supporters.

Host Brian Stelter put off the Smollett story until after the first commercial break, choosing instead to bemoan President Trump’s “distractions” from other stories about his administration.

When they finally got around to Smollett, Foster was up first and immediately pointed out that “there were a lot of reasons for skepticism from very, very early on here.” After noting the “rush to judgment”, he explained where that bias came from: “I think in a lot of speculative controversies where the media is necessarily reporting on a story really, really early when we don't know much, folks have to go with what we suppose. And what we knew at the time was the President’s supporters are racist.”

“My heart goes out to anyone who gets attacked, but it's totally appropriate to exercise a bit of skepticism and exercise a bit of patience in waiting for the facts to develop around this story. And as they have developed, this story looks very different than what most people suspected,” Foster added after pointing out some of Smollett’s unbelievable claims.

Henderson, condemned the reporting in a statement obtained by TV Guide, saying, ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

The statement continued, ""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, declined to comment on the reports when reached by TV Guide.

The New York Times reports that the brothers, named Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were detained after arriving on a flight from Nigeria, and their home was raided by police. According to CBS Chicago, several items were seized in the raid, including a script from Empire. One of the brothers had worked as an extra on Empire, and their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, confirmed to the Times that they both knew Smollett.

On Thursday, 20th Century Fox Television addressed reports that the alleged attack against the actor had been staged with Smollett's involvement after he discovered he was to be written off Empire. In a statement, the studio denied any plans to write the actor off the Fox drama, saying, ""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him."" Chicago P.D.'s rep also denied those initial reports.

A representative for Smollett told TV Guide Thursday evening that the actor was cooperating with the police investigation. In a statement to Essence earlier this month, Smollett said, ""I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ""

The Chicago Police Department has confirmed its interest in interviewing Empire star Jussie Smollett again, following unconfirmed reports that two suspects apprehended by authorities in connection with his attack claimed to have been paid to participate in a hoax.

In a statement to TV Guide, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, ""While we are not in a position to comment, confirm or deny what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in the investigation and we are now interested in speaking to the Empire cast member again.

“Well, the information is still coming out, and I’m going to withhold until all the information comes out,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters Sunday when asked about his past remarks on the Smollett case.

Booker’s remarks are a far cry from a tweet he posted in the hours after Smollett’s alleged attack was reported.

WATCH:

NEW: Booker said he is waiting for more info on the new reports of Jussie Smollet’s attack potentially being a planned hoax. He called it a “modern-day lynching” when first reported. pic.twitter.com/rHNNJtNvCs — Bo Erickson (@BoKnowsNews) February 17, 2019

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker wrote on Jan. 29.

Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed that he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two white men who hurled racist and homophobic insults at him while he was walking in Chicago. The actor also claimed that his assailants placed a rope around his neck during the attack. (RELATED: Here Are All The Politicians Who Rushed To Judgement In The Smollett ‘Hate Crime’)

Democratic lawmakers and left-wing activists jumped to Smollett’s defense. In addition to Booker, California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris called the incident a “modern-day lynching.” New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted it was a “racist, homophobic attack.”

Chicago police now suspect that Smollett paid two acquaintances to stage an attack against him, according to reports from numerous outlets. The two men, who are U.S. citizens of Nigerian descent, were arrested Wednesday but released from custody Friday. They are reportedly cooperating with investigators.

Instead of backtracking on his earlier comments in the Smollett case, Booker shifted Sunday to a discussion of other hate crimes in the U.S.

“We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise, in a serious way,” Booker told reporters.

Asked whether Smollett should comment publicly in the face of new information in the case, Booker said: “Again, I’m following this case as you are. We’ll see this happen.”

Booker was also asked whether Smollett’s apparent hoax undercuts an anti-lynching bill that the Democrat introduced earlier this week.

Booker dodged the question.

“We have seen painful realities surge in our country, a rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks,” he said. “We’re seeing just vicious, horrific, cruel violence that’s motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all neighborhoods and communities are safe.”

Following the brothers’ arrest on Wednesday, the police department reportedly discovered “new evidence” that allowed for their release on Friday.

Jussie Smollett told police that on January 29th he was attacked by two unidentified men who put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on his face. The alleged attackers were reportedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs while they were assaulting him.

The former suspects Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo who are of Nigerian decent, were released 48 hours after their initial arrest. The two brothers are reportedly friends of Smollett’s and have worked with him as extras on his series Empire, in addition to going to the same gym.

In a statement to Deadline, a source close to the investigation said that the focus has now gravitated towards Smollett as the potential orchestrator. “The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” they reported.

During an interview on Good Morning America, Smollett addressed the accusations that he had dramatized the details of the alleged attack. “It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

Police now believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack with Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, Nigerian brothers and former Empire extras who he reportedly hired to assault him. Smollett plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox show.

Smollett’s lawyers quickly denied the assertion that Smollett was somehow involved in the seemingly racist and homophobic attack that took the world by storm three weeks ago. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

According to CNN, Chicago police determined that Smollett was “an active participant in the incident” after they interviewed the Osundairo brothers, who at the time were considered “potential suspects” in the assault after police obtained enough evidence to implicate the duo.

In an interview with Good Morning America last week, Smollett said that he believed he was the victim of the attack—in which two men allegedly put a rope around his neck and said “this is MAGA country—because of his criticism of President Trump. “I come really, really hard against 45,” he said. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Smollett’s attorneys added that “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”"

He told police that his attackers immediately identified him as a gay actor from “Empire,” then proceeded to yell racial and homophobic slurs, shout “this is MAGA country,” pour an unknown chemical on him and place a noose around his neck. The story has since become even more complicated: The Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers, one of whom said that he played a small part on “Empire,” about their possible role in the attack. As of this writing, the department is seeking to interview Smollett again; he has hired a criminal defense attorney.

But even before these latest details emerged, when I first heard of the attack on Smollett, I had to pause. On “Empire,” Jamal Lyon came out as gay in front of his homophobic, abusive father; took a bullet for that same father and overcame an addiction to pain pills. Was I reading last week’s episode recap, or did this actually happen in my hometown of Chicago? Almost immediately, I had a terrible feeling that I was victim blaming, or worse, that I am so brainwashed that I no longer can hear cries of hurt and outrage from my own black community. It was a horrifying feeling that I am still trying to work through almost three weeks later.

I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did. I know that there is a deep, dark racist history in Chicago and, if proved true, this would be just one more point on the list. I wanted to believe him with every fiber of my being, most of all because the consequences if he were lying were almost too awful to contemplate.

And yet I struggled with Smollett’s story.

I tried telling myself that it is possible that two assailants were walking around downtown Chicago at 2 a.m. in January in 10-degree weather, waiting for a black victim. In addition to that, they were stalking around with a bottle of bleach and a rope. And ultimately, the prey they selected was an actor on a show that they must’ve been somewhat familiar with, because they were able to not only name the show but also know that he played a gay character. Never mind the fact that he was likely bundled up because again: Chicago, January, 10 degrees. Also, after he fought to get away, he left the rope around his neck until he got to the hospital.

Perhaps I don’t want to believe him because this is a stark and scary reminder of the poor condition of the country (and city) that I call home. Maybe this story makes the boogeyman in my nightmares all too real, too close and too calculating. Maybe it’s because while I consider myself an ally to the LGBTQ community, I still don’t understand and appreciate the daily harassment that they endure. Or maybe even though I am a black woman, I still don’t know what it’s like to be a black man in America.

Over the past few hours, there have been speculations that have confirmed my worst fears. Unnamed “police sources” have claimed that Smollett orchestrated the entire thing.

If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of “fake news.”

And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true, despite its ugliness and despite what it would say about the danger of the world I live in. The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting. This could be one tragedy that the Lyon family — and more importantly, the ordinary people who loved the show and invested in Smollett and his character — could never overcome.

Chicago - Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the ""Empire"" actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs. In a statement, late Saturday the lawyers say: ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack. Chicago police earlier Saturday said their investigation of the attack had ""shifted"" following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects but then released from police custody Friday without being charged. Smollett's attorneys say that one of the men was the actor's personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

The latest developments come after Chicago police said ""the trajectory of the investigation"" into the reported attack on Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the ""Empire"" actor.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guglielmi's comment.

According to sources close to the investigation, the brothers who were arrested are being kept under police watch to ensure that no one — particularly Smollett — makes contact to them.

The outlet also has updates on several aspects of the case, noting that when the brothers’ home was raided they found magazines with pages torn out of them. Police are now trying to figure out if the magazines are the source of the threatening letter sent to Smollett before the attack. While they believe the brothers bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck, there is no surveillance video because the hardware store erases its tape after a week.

Smollett was asked if he would sign complaints against the men who attacked him and he said yes early on, but according to the site’s sources when he found out the brothers were the ones arrested he said he knew them and felt bad, so didn’t want to sign the complaints.

Police tracked the brothers down by their movements, noting they had left in either a cab or an Uber and tracked them to the point they left the vehicle and got into another one. Police reportedly didn’t believe Smollett’s story when he took them to the point of the attack and pointed to what is called an obscure camera, saying he was happy the attack was on video. However, the camera was pointing the wrong way so it wasn’t recorded. The police thought it strange that he knew the location of the camera.

There was no video of a “rehearsal” of the attack, which some reports said took place, and police didn’t believe the attackers made their reported “MAGA country” comment because “not a single Trump supporter watches Empire.”

Smollett has denied the attack was staged.

ORIGINAL: A new report broke over the weekend in which sources claim Jussie Smollett is suspected of orchestrating the attack on himself. CNN reports that two police sources told the outlet that Smollett may have paid the two men who attacked him late last month.

According to the site, the two men who were arrested on Wednesday — Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo — were released without charges on Friday due to “new evidence” cited by Chicago police. The two men are now cooperating with law enforcement and, according to the sources, there are records which show the brothers bought the rope that was around Smollett’s neck at a Chicago hardware store.

TMZ reports that according to the Chicago PD, Smollett is not officially a suspect. The department said in a statement, “We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question. After new developments, we’ve reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.” TMZ reports that at least one of the two brothers arrested — who have appeared on Empire as extras — has turned over his phone to police and there is a call between him and Smollett in the vicinity of the attack that took place before it happened.

Smollett’s lawyers issued a statement to CNN which read, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying…At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

A rumor had been going around that Smollett was being written off of Empire, but 20th Century Fox TV shot that down in a statement which read, “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

Jussie Smollett is NOT yet a suspect in the Chicago Police Department’s ongoing investigation into his attack — at least, that’s what the official word is from the department.

Multiple sources inside the department are now telling TMZ, on the other hand, that he IS a suspect, and that the department is seriously investigating the possibility that he staged and/or faked the attack.

Related: Jussie’s Legal Team Speaks Out About New Developments

The official wording from the department about Smollett not being a suspect came down early this morning, when the police told the media outlet (below):

“We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question. After new developments, we’ve reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.”

That makes a lot of sense, of course — police are in some ways back to square one with their investigation after clearing and releasing the two Nigerian brothers who may or may not have been involved in a set-up for the alleged attack.

Inside the department, though, it appears that there is a different sentiment: sources claim cops have long felt that “Jussie’s story didn’t track,” even though they “officially never let on” what they thought to the public.

So far, no words that Smollett has agreed to do another interview with police.

He has lawyered up, though, which is a smart, pragmatic move and well within his rights, no matter what role he did or didn’t play surrounding this attack.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a “f****t,” “n****r” and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown “chemical substance.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects — but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a “relationship” with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

Smollett’s lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is “angered and devastated” by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” Trump Jr. wrote.

US President Donald Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as “horrible.”

Smollett claimed the beat down was provoked by his public comments against Mr Trump.

Smollett, an actor on the TV show Empire, told Chicago police he was attacked by two men early in the morning of Jan. 29.

Smollett alleged that the two men called him the N-word and F-word, wrapped rope around his neck, and shouted, “This is MAGA country.”

On Thursday, Chicago Police Department spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that reports that the attack was orchestrated were “unconfirmed by case detectives.”

Then, on Friday, Guglielmi stated that detectives had “additional investigative work to complete” after releasing two individuals, a pair of brothers from Nigeria, being questioned in connection with the case.

The brothers, identified as Ola and Abel Osundairo, are reportedly cooperating with the police. They were arrested Wednesday on returning from the U.S. from Nigeria; police reportedly raided their home Wednesday, retrieving a red hat, bleach, shoes, and electronics, according to ABC.

On Saturday, Guglielmi told the BBC, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” he added.

Smollett through his lawyers has denied allegations that he was behind the attack.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” his lawyers Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh said in a statement.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Conservatives on Twitter have seized on the situation.

The Daily Dot reached out to the Chicago Police Department for an update on the case but did not receive a response by press time. Guglielmi told the Daily Dot in an email,

We have been in touch with his attorney and made that request.

Whatever the outcome of the investigation, hate crimes against marginalized people, including people of color and LGBTQ people, increased from 2016 to 2017 as reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As the Human Rights Campaign points out, hate crimes are underreported.

CNN reports that investigators believe “Empire” star Jussie Smollett may have paid two men to stage his alleged attack.

Smollett’s attorneys deny the reports, though several people have already reacted to the latest development on Twitter.

Prominent Republican figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Laura Ingraham have criticised the media’s reporting of the alleged attack.

Others such as CNN correspondent Victor Blackwell and Attorney Michael Avenatti have expressed concern over what this will mean for victims of real hate crimes if the attack was actually orchestrated.

Detectives are still investigating the case.

The investigation into the alleged attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett has taken a turn now after CNN reported that investigators believe Smollett may have paid two men to stage his attack, which he has been framing as a hate crime.

Chicago police released the two Nigerian brothers late Friday evening after finding new evidence to investigate after questioning them. TMZ reports the brothers in question are Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who both reportedly worked on the set of “Empire.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, have denied the reports that Smollett orchestrated the attack, which he says involved the attackers putting a noose around his neck, chanting Trump slogans, pouring bleach on him, and using racist and homophobic slurs.

Now, several prominent figures have reacted to the latest developments on Twitter. The news has especially caused ripples among high-profile conservative leaders, as the initial reports claimed the alleged attackers were Trump supporters who yelled “This is MAGA country” during the attack.

President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., has tweeted about the media’s initial response to the story, claiming that several news outlets “accepted his lies as facts for weeks.”

Trump Jr. also said the initial reports that the alleged attackers were Trump supporters were left out in this latest development. A scan of the article shows that it does include references to “MAGA” and Trump.

CNN correspondent Victor Blackwell expressed concern that if the alleged attack was actually orchestrated, it could harm the victims of real hate crimes.

After two persons of interest, Nigerian-American brothers Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested and released, police issued a statement on the status of the case.

""After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again,"" CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The New York Times. He followed with a statement saying, ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

On January 29th, Smollett reported that he’d been attacked by two men who beat him, doused him with a chemical substance, and called him racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett was on the phone with his agent, Brandon Z. Moore, when he was accosted, and Moore told Variety that he heard the assailants shout ""MAGA country.""

Though few details have been released through official channels, news outlets are reporting that sources within the CPD say police believe Smollett orchestrated the attack himself. According to CNN, law enforcement sources say the Osundairos, one of whom has appeared on Empire, purchased the noose that was found around Smollett’s neck, and other sources report that the brothers say they were paid $3,500 to carry out the attack.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson released a statement of their own, saying that one of the Osundairo brothers was the actor’s personal trainer.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" said the statement. ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.""

In the wake of rumors that Smollett orchestrated the attack to prevent his character from being written off of Empire, the show's writers tweeted earlier this week that they had no such plans.

Chicago Police: Jussie Smollett Assault Case Has ‘Shifted’

CHICAGO—Chicago police said on Saturday, Feb. 16, that the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys issued a statement later on Saturday, saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. The police said that they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of the brothers.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Smollett’s attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in a statement.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Various reports out of Chicago, citing police sources, allege that Smollett orchestrated the January 29th attack; the two men now implicated in the attack, Nigerian brothers who appeared on Empire and worked out with Smollett, are cooperating with police regarding the case.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” Smollett’s lawyers continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett claimed that two men wearing red hats attacked him, yelled racial slurs, poured bleach on him and tied a rope around his neck as he walked back to his Chicago apartment. Police later determined the two men were Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were arrested but ultimately released following an interrogation.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Gugliemli tweeted Friday, “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

While police are still investigating the attack, CBS Chicago reports that Smollett hired the two brothers to stage the attack, as well as purchase the rope and bleach used in the hate crime. The actor allegedly paid the brothers $3,500 to commit the attack, with an additional $500 promised after the brothers returned from a trip to Nigeria that happened to begin January 29th, hours after the early morning attack.

A rep for the Chicago police told TMZ, “We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question. After new developments, we’ve reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.”"

Police now believe that Smollett orchestrated the attack with Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, Nigerian brothers and former Empire extras who he reportedly hired to assault him. Smollett plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox show.

Smollett’s lawyers quickly denied the assertion that Smollett was somehow involved in the seemingly racist and homophobic attack that took the world by storm three weeks ago. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

According to CNN, Chicago police determined that Smollett was “an active participant in the incident” after they interviewed the Osundairo brothers, who at the time were considered “potential suspects” in the assault after police obtained enough evidence to implicate the duo.

In an interview with Good Morning America last week, Smollett said that he believed he was the victim of the attack—in which two men allegedly put a rope around his neck and said “this is MAGA country—because of his criticism of President Trump. “I come really, really hard against 45,” he said. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Smollett’s attorneys added that “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” wrote Smollett’s lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, in a statement obtained by Deadline.

The statement comes after Chicago police interviewed the previously sought persons of interest in the still image taken from surveillance video.

Police arrested the potential suspects on Feb. 13, then released them without charge on Feb. 15. The two men, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are brothers. One of them was an extra on “Empire” three seasons ago, according to Deadline.

In the statement, Smollett’s lawyers admit Smollett knew one of the suspects.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” read the statement.

But then the lawyers cast doubt on what the investigation of the suspects has led police to believe.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” said the statement.

A CNN article indicates police sources have come to believe Smollett paid the two men to stage the attack. A source also told CNN that police traced the purchase of the rope found around Smollett’s neck to a purchase made by one of the arrested brothers at a Chicago hardware store.

Today reported that the two brothers are from Nigeria, and that police searched their home, finding a black ski mask, bottles of bleach, and an “Empire” script.

On Feb. 15, the same day the Osundairo brothers were released, Today published a video interview with Smollett. In the interview, Smollett said he did not notice the rope around his neck until after the attack was over, despite claiming he fought back hard against the alleged attackers until they ran away. He also said the attackers wore ski masks, and that he only gave the police a description of the alleged attackers’ body type, and that he didn’t make out anything else about them.

Yet Smollett confirms that the people in the image released by police are his alleged attackers.

“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” he said.

Smollett said that he first noticed bleach during the time after the police were called and before they arrived, while checking his injuries after the attack.

“But I smelled bleach. I know the smell of bleach. And I saw on my sweatshirt, it had marks on it, like spots on it when you have a bad bleach job.”

He said he did not change out of the clothing with the bleach substance, nor did he remove the rope from around his neck, while he waited for police to arrive. He also said he told them to turn their body cams off when they arrived.

Interviewer Robin Roberts brings up that people supported him earlier, but now have doubts as time has passed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot, much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

He seems unaware that the two arrested by police were black, which were the same two he confirmed must have attacked him. And his reasoning for why he isn’t getting the support he got when the alleged attack was first publicized, has to do with society as a whole, and not the lack of evidence in this specific case.

In addition to racial and homophobic slurs, Smollett claimed his attackers shouted “MAGA country,” though he disputes reports they wore “Make America Great Again” hats.

When asked why he feels he was targeted, Smollett said it is because he speaks out against President Trump. But Roberts reminds him that President Trump said, “I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned” when asked about Smollett’s alleged attack. A clip of that response is included in the interview video.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” tweeted Donald Trump Jr., as the idea that Smollett manufactured the incident started to spread."

However, after police began to investigate the incident, some disturbing leads were revealed. Chicago Police claim that they have evidence that the Empire star played a role in his attack. According to CNN, the police believe that Smollett paid the two men to plan the attack.

Smollett’s lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement denying that he would do such a thing.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The former suspects in the attack, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were released Friday (Feb. 15) evening and are cooperating with the police. Police found evidence that the two brothers purchased the rope that was put around Smollett’s neck during the attack.

Smollett knows the Osundairo brothers well because they have played extras on Empire for the past few years.

The 34-year-old has been frustrated about claims that he is lying about the attack.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said during an interview on Good Morning America. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”"

That is the question many are asking, after CNN reported that the investigation by Chicago police into Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack has changed.

CBS News reported that, according to a source close to the investigation, the brothers who were arrested last week told police the actor paid them to participate in the alleged attack and that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a nearby hardware store. The source added that police have evidence to corroborate the sale.

ABC News also reported that the men told police they were paid. The network added that police are trying to corroborate the men's account but they have not been able to independently verify the information.

""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,"" Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter Sunday afternoon.

The brothers, who are from Nigeria, were also extras on the show. They were released last week without charges, in light of what authorities call “new evidence.” Cops say the brothers are being cooperative.

However, in a statement to multiple outlets, Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson maintain he was the victim of a crime.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement read. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continued: “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

On Jan. 29, Smollett said two men attacked him in a Chicago alley, poured a bleach-like substance on him and yelled “MAGA country.”

After the story broke, several messages on social media poured in to support him.

He was also met with messages doubting the whole story.

Last week, Smollett appeared on ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" to discuss the alleged incident and refute claims the story was fake.

“I was there. For me, when that was released, I was like OK, we’re getting somewhere,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did,” Smollett said on the broadcast, referring to the brothers.

Sky News host Andrew Bolt says the media blamed President Trump for the incident, and that similar anti-Trump stories have been publicised in the past, that have since proved fake. Mr Bolt says the 'strange' story should be a warning against people pushing stories they want to believe are true, but which they 'cannot know are true'.

Jussie Smollett allegedly promised to pay two friends $4000 ($A5600) to stage his racist and homophobic assault — which the trio even rehearsed beforehand, according to a new report.

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a “f****t,” “n****r” and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown “chemical substance.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects — but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a “relationship” with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

Smollett’s lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is “angered and devastated” by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” Trump Jr. wrote.

US President Donald Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as “horrible.”

Smollett claimed the beat down was provoked by his public comments against Mr Trump.

It’s one of two fatal crashes that occurred over the weekend in Maine.

The service says the crash that killed Troy Marden, a senior and star football player at Amesbury High School, occurred on Thompson Lake in Portland just before 11 p.m. Saturday.

The service says two snowmobiles were operating on a plowed portion of the lake when the snowmobile operated by Marden failed to negotiate a corner and hit a snowbank.

Wardens say the operator of the other snowmobile tried to assist Marden before getting help.

Marden was pronounced dead at the scene.

His family is asking for privacy at this time but some people who knew him are remembering him as a ""kind soul.""

Marden's football number 48 was honored on the school's Facebook page Sunday night, where photos highlighted his high school career.

Classmates and parents left heartfelt condolences, as well as prayers for Marden's family.

As the Amesbury High School community grieves, many are still in shock after being stunned by the news of his death.

In a message sent to families in the Amesbury school district, Superintendent Jared Fulgoni called Marden's death a ""tragic loss to our school community.""

""We are deeply saddened by our loss, and our thoughts and prayers are with Troy’s family and friends,"" the message read.

Stating that Marden's death is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for the entire school community, Fulgoni says Amesbury Public Schools has a team of professionals prepared to help with the needs of students, parents, and school personnel.

Counselors will be available Monday at the Amesbury High School cafeteria from 1 to 4 p.m. for anyone who needs support.

The warden service is also investigating another snowmobile crash that resulted in a death on a Norway lake Saturday. The service says that crash killed 52-year-old Gracie Herrick Onofrio of Norway.

The accident happened just after 3:30 p.m. on Pennesseewassee Lake.

Wardens say a snowmobile hit the snowbanks of a plowed road on the lake, sending the vehicle airborne and throwing Onofrio from the snowmobile.

A second snowmobile from the party then struck Onofrio, officials said.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The service reminds all snowmobile operators to be mindful of their surroundings and manage their speed, especially with snowmobile traffic increasing during vacation week."

According to the New York Post, the embattled Empire star paid $3500 ($A4900) to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 ($A700) upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

The brothers told police that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practised it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighbourhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2am attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a “f****t,” “n****r” and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown “chemical substance.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested on Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects — but then released on Friday without charges.

They are co-operating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Police have said the pair of budding model-actors have a “relationship” with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on the Fox network.

MORE: ‘Persons of interest’ questioned over attack

Smollett’s lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late on Saturday, saying the actor is “angered and devastated” by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

Two brothers who have worked with Jussie Smollett on ""Empire"" have been arrested in connection to the alleged racist and homophobic assault on the actor, though they have not yet been formally charged, according to Chicago police.

Smollett says he was attacked while leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago on Jan. 29. He said two men hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him before beating him, throwing a chemical on him, which may have been bleach, and leaving a noose around his neck. He said that as they attacked him, at least one of them said, “this is MAGA country.”

The two men, who Chicago police have described as suspects, are Nigerian brothers who were picked up at O'Hare International Airport on their way back from Nigeria, according to the Associated Press. They were arrested on probable cause and a search warrant was executed at their home.

Gloria Schmidt, the brothers' attorney, told CBS News her clients could face charges but she doesn't know what those charges might be. She denied their involvement in the attack on Smollett.

""They are baffled about why they are people of interest,"" she said. ""It's an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it's not my guys.""

Schmidt said her clients worked with Smollett on the set of ""Empire"" and also know him from a local gym.

""This is someone that they know, this is someone that they've worked with. So they don't want to see somebody go through that,"" Schmidt said.

During the search of their home, police allegedly removed bleach, a black facemask, a red hat and an ""Empire"" script, according to CBS Chicago.

This week two reports, from ABC and CBS stations in Chicago and citing unnamed police sources, have raised the possibility that Smollett staged the attack. A potential motive could be that Smollett was being written off ""Empire,"" according to ABC7Chicago.

However, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that reports of the ""incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.""

Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives.

In an email to CBS Chicago, Guglielmi further said that ""while we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is also no evidence to say that this is a hoax. The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

The production company behind ""Empire,"" 20th Century Fox, also denies claims that Smollett was being written off the show.

Recently, in an interview with “Good Morning America,” Smollett said he has been “100% factual and consistent” when working with police and that rumors of his story being fabricated have left him “pissed off.”"

This is coming after the police released the brothers who they said would not be charged for the case. The brothers are said to be cooperating with the probe and reportedly revealed during investigation that Smollett paid them up to $3,500 to carry out the ‘attack’.

They told policemen that they purchased the rope for the noose recovered from Smollett’s neck after the attack, and have turned over to cops the Ace Hardware receipt for their purchase of the rope, Fox 32 reports.

Investigators are now eager to speak again with the actor, who has since hired an arsenal of attorneys including Todd Pugh, Victor P. Henderson, and Michael Monico, a high-powered criminal attorney who also reps Michael Cohen, the former lawyer for US President Donald Trump.

Smollett through his reps has also released a statement concerning the new developments in the case, affirming that he was ‘angered and devastated’ to learn that the perpetrators of the attack are individuals familiar with him. His attorneys also debunk claim that he was involved, saying “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The Nigerian brothers are well known to the actor and have worked as extras on the TV series. They are workout buddies as they use the same gym as Smollett. They travelled to Nigeria on the Night of the attack and were reportedly picked up from the airport when they returned back to the United States.

Authorities say they responded to a report of a shooting on Spring Avenue in the area of Walker Street just after 6:15 p.m.

When officers arrived on scene, they found a 30-year-old Lowell man suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was transported to Lowell General Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

“Right away I just went to the hospital,” said Tony Iem, the victim’s brother. “The doctor came out and announced that he was — that he didn’t make it.”

The victim's brother has identified the man as Jimmy Iem. According to Tony Iem, his brother leaves behind a girlfriend, a 3-year-old son and 5-year-old son.

“My mom’s still hoping he’s going to wake up, and I hope the same,” said Tony Iem. “It’s hard to accept it; I can’t believe it.”

The Iem family gathered at the scene of the shooting Sunday to create a memorial.

""When you think of a big brother who you can go to and feel safe around, he was that guy,"" Tony Iem said.

Jimmy Iem had just returned from a Valentine's Day weekend trip with his girlfriend when he stopped by a friend's house, his brother says.

""He came out to grab his phone from his car, and it happened,"" Tony Iem said.

Investigators are working to determine what exactly happened and why. Lowell police haven't announced any arrests in the case.

The victim's identity has not yet been released by authorities.

Smollett has described an attack on him late last month in which two masked men assaulted him and yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

“After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again,” Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago police, said in a brief phone interview. He declined to discuss the reports that described accounts the brothers had reportedly made to investigators.

In a follow-up statement, Guglielmi said, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Multiple outlets, including CNN, reported Saturday that investigators in the case, which was initially being explored as a possible hate crime, now believe that Smollett organized the incident.

Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, lawyers representing Smollett, released a statement late Saturday saying, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

The statement added: “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

The lawyers said Smollett would “continue to cooperate,” and they “have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation.”

One of the brothers had worked as an extra on “Empire,” and their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, has confirmed that they both knew Smollett. The two men were detained Wednesday after arriving on a flight from Nigeria. That same day, the police raided their home and, according to CBS Chicago, removed several items including an “Empire” script, a phone and a black face mask hat. Initially, they were described as “potential persons of interest.”

On Friday, Chicago police referred to them as “potential suspects,” but by Friday evening, they had been released without being charged. The police still have not publicly said why.

The brothers, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, could not be reached for comment. Schmidt declined to comment Saturday on the reports but said the brothers had completed their cooperation with the police.

Smollett has rejected skepticism about his account that emerged on social media after he made his initial report to law enforcement.

In that account, Smollett, who is black and gay, said that in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, he was attacked by two masked men who made a reference to “Empire.” He also said the attackers made a reference to “MAGA country,” an allusion to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” According to Smollett’s account, the men then tied a noose around his neck, poured a chemical substance on him and fled.

Investigators could not generate many leads on finding suspects. There was no surveillance footage of the attack in an area of the city that the police said was heavily covered with cameras. Days after Smollett first spoke to the police, the department released an image showing two men that they said were potential persons of interest; according to the police, those ended up being the two men they detained last week. That the men, who are of Nigerian descent, were acquaintances of Smollett, fueled further speculation about the circumstances of an assault.

A spokesman for Fox, the network on which “Empire” airs, declined to comment.

In an interview broadcast Thursday on “Good Morning America,” Smollett was adamant that his story was true. For weeks, law enforcement backed up his assertions, saying publicly that investigators had no reason to doubt his story.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,” Smollett told ABC’s Robin Roberts. “A lot more.”

He said he was sure that the men in the surveillance images released by law enforcement were his attackers.

“Because I was there,” Smollett said. “For me, when that was released, I was like, ‘OK, we’re getting somewhere.’ I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

After news of Smollett’s incident broke, several celebrities and advocacy groups offered their support for the actor as the case received national attention.

On Jan. 31, two days after the reported attack, Smollett’s family members, several who are involved in the entertainment business, released a joint statement, saying: “We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.”

Even Trump weighed in from the Oval Office, saying that the attack was “horrible” and that it “doesn’t get worse.”

Smollett responded to Trump’s comments during the ABC interview: “I saw it. I don’t know what to say to that. You know, I appreciate him not brushing over it.”

Smollett had claimed, per the Washington Examiner, that his attackers were white, had shouted “This is MAGA country,” had beaten him soundly, tied a noose around his neck, and poured an unknown chemical over him.

The ground seems to be shifting beneath Smollett’s initial recounting, however, as new details come to light under a police investigation. Vanity Fair breathlessly recounted the sordid details in an article that did not bother to interrogate the actor’s allegations as simply that — allegations — instead recounting his story as hard news reportage. While certain details of the story were offered a caveat, the fact that “Smollett was attacked by two white men” was offered up as being beyond dispute.

Now, as CBS Chicago reports, sources say that the investigation has drastically shifted focus. Two Nigerian brothers who were allegedly paid by Smollett have seen their home raided by police, with the subsequent evidence being discovered being particularly damning to Smollett’s accounting of events. The same rope — called a noose — by Smollett was found on the scene, as were a red hat, bleach, and an Empire script. The source claims that the brothers were questioned by police, and told them that they had coordinated with Smollett in the staging of the attack. CBS Chicago also details that their source claims the brothers were paid $3,500 after having conducted the incident, whereupon they quickly fled to Nigeria for a period of time. They were apparently apprehended by law enforcement officials after returning to the United States.

Whether or not Smollett lied about the attack — in great or in small detail — is important, but what may even more important is to consider how the press unwittingly stoked the flames of division even further by accepting his account at face value. While it would certainly be a grand coincidence that the two men would be known to Smollett, would have the items he detailed as being part of the attack in their apartment, would have suggested they worked with him in concert while under police questioning — in a court of law, one is innocent until proven guilty.

In certain corners of the media circus, however, a purported victim is always to be believed, despite a questionable story and a lack of substantial evidence. No longer does the burden of proof fall upon the accuser — a tenet of Enlightenment philosophy.

Further, such an account can be then be used to stoke partisan divides and greater political fracture.

Per Townhall, Ellen Page took to Stephen Colbert’s late night show to excoriate anyone who dare disbelieve Smollett’s accounting of events, using emotionally charged language to illogically frame Vice President Mike Pence as having been responsible for a purported hate crime. Representative Maxine Waters took the opportunity, per the Daily Mail, to frame Trump for the purportedly vicious crime — despite the fact that President Trump had immediately commented on the alleged attack to say it was “horrible.” Reverend Al Sharpton and the usual rogues gallery of cultural critics tripped over one another to virtue signal over the incident, pushing one another out of the way to find a proper spot in front of a camera and a microphone. Victimhood — real or imagined — has become an attractive drug, an emotional high, to too many people in positions of power.

Smollett himself is certainly not innocent of hurling hateful invective. In a Twitter message dated January 11, 2018, Smollett referred to Trump as a “b*tch ass n**ga,” and a “literal sh**,” after telling the president to “shut the hell up.” There was an apparent fixation with the president’s politics and policies, and while it is certainly appropriate to disagree with one’s elected leader, the fact that a clear motive to frame the alleged attack as a MAGA-fueled hate crime exists cannot be easily denied.

Hate crime hoaxes have seen a resurgence in popularity as late, with Breitbart compiling list of the 10 most influential from 2018 alone. From recalcitrant Kavanaugh accusers to numerous other politically motivated stunts, it appears that the truth — and the truth alone — is not enough to satisfy a 24 / 7 media cycle hungry for salacious headlines, particularly if those headline conjure the fell beasts of racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, or anything which casts Donald J. Trump in a particularly sinister light.

Two Nigerian brothers could be charged in Jussie Smollett attack https://t.co/THfW8MF1no pic.twitter.com/hdV0KztubJ — New York Post (@nypost) February 15, 2019

One particular example of the latter, per NPR, came just prior to the 2016 presidential election. In a widely reported story wherein a black church was vandalized with “Vote Trump” graffiti and set aflame prior to said election — a story where the primary narrative was that of a growing “hate movement” led by Trump — it turns out that the arsonist and vandal in question was actually an African-American parishioner of said church. Mississippi insurance commissioner Mike Chaney would then have the gall to claim that, “We do not believe it was politically motivated… There may have been some efforts to make it appear politically motivated.”

This may beggar belief, but it may also be unfortunately representative of the rigid intellectual paradigm of “listen, and believe.” This is particularly evident when the truth may be uncomfortably politically incorrect under the contemporary paradigm.

Objectivity may be an impossibility, as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson once famous wrote, but such a utopian ideal still remains a concept worth striving for — particularly amongst the professional press.

Smollett’s lawyers, perhaps unsurprisingly, deny all claims that their client engaged in the manufacturing of a hate crime hoax, per the BBC."

Chicago police now believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the alleged assault that took place against him late last month, according to CNN. The two men, who are brothers, were arrested on Wednesday and released two days later without being charged after authorities found “new evidence” in the case. CNN’s law-enforcement sources say those men are now “cooperating fully” with the investigation.

The “Empire” actor said he was attacked in the early hours of January 29 by men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown substance on him, and said they were in “MAGA Country,” short for Make America Great Again.

Via his attorneys, Smollett has released a statement in which he denies having staged the incident:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

However, there have been claims that the actor might have staged the attack.

According to Daily Mail, Smollett has faced allegations that he might have staged the incident to save his role in popular series, Empire, because he was reportedly being written off the show.

There have been reports that two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo might have been paid off by Smollett to stage the attack.

The brothers were arrested on February 13, 2019, in connection to the case. They were picked up at the airport in Chicago after they arrived from Nigeria where they had gone to spend some time with their family.

Interestingly the brothers have been released with no charges as the police revealed there is now new evidence. Smollett has also vehemently denied paying the two brothers $3,500 to attack him.

His lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, disclosed to Entertainment Weekly that the star is now being victimised over the false allegations of him staging the incident. They also added that one of the brothers was Smollett’s trainer for a music video.

They said: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

Meanwhile after the news of the attack hit social media, some Nigerian celebs took to consoling the star including Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh.

Tonto preached love as she explained that people should not be attacked for loving differently. She also sent love and light the actor's way.

Authorities say they responded to a report of a shooting on Spring Avenue in the area of Walker Street just after 6:15 p.m.

When officers arrived on scene, they found a 30-year-old Lowell man suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was transported to Lowell General Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

“Right away I just went to the hospital,” said Tony Iem, the victim’s brother. “The doctor came out and announced that he was — that he didn’t make it.”

The victim's brother has identified the man as Jimmy Iem. According to Tony Iem, his brother leaves behind a girlfriend, a 3-year-old son and 5-year-old son.

“My mom’s still hoping he’s going to wake up, and I hope the same,” said Tony Iem. “It’s hard to accept it; I can’t believe it.”

The Iem family gathered at the scene of the shooting Sunday to create a memorial.

Maybe my feelings will change, maybe this very strange story will take another baffling twist or turn.

But I was devastated on Saturday when news broke that two police sources with knowledge of the investigation into the attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett had told CNN that they believe he paid two brothers from Nigeria to stage his assault.

The brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, (who both previously worked out with Smollett, with Olabinjo also appearing as an extra on Empire in 2015) were questioned on Wednesday and released without charges Friday.

Smollett is sticking with his story. As shock among his supporters spread online, the actor's defense lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement saying that he had not staged the attack, that ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The statement continued: ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack…

""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

Perhaps like many following this story today, Sunday, the questions, amid all this claim and counter-claim are: Who and what to believe? If it's true that he staged it, why did he do it? Was the interview he gave to ABC earlier this week merely performance?

As more facts continue to unfold, one thing is for certain: It’s time for us to all re-evaluate the role of celebrities within activist movements.

I wrote in defense of Smollett in The Daily Beast when reports surfaced of the alleged attack, and it pains me to say this, but I no longer believe the actor.

At this point, it’s now safe to imply that something is incredibly bizarre about this entire situation. It will only be a matter of time before the whole ordeal is revealed, but I’m not holding my breath any longer.

The police wouldn’t have immediately released those brothers connected to Smollett’s alleged assault without good reason. CBS reported that the brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and promised $500 more on their return—and that’s where all the dominos fell for me. If this is true, these men weren’t the MAGA white men in masks who Smollett initially claimed were yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him while putting a rope around his neck. They were actually two black men who he knew very well that were allegedly paid off to make him a victim of a fake hate crime. They are now fully cooperating with the police, and may discredit all that Smollett told us.

I’m so disgusted right now, and the only phrase that keeps going in my head is “there goes the neighborhood.”

Social media has now been littered with reactivated online bigots who are already using this high-profile scandal to immediately discredit the lived experiences of countless Black LGBTQ people. In an instant turn of events, this situation has fueled a false sense of legitimacy in some MAGA supporters who already routinely discount racism and homophobia in America.

Smollett pulled from both his identities—being Black and gay—to draw empathy across the board. Now both communities will have to endure another high-tech lynching from trolls who will make Smollett the poster-child for not believing victims of hate crimes.

This situation reminds me of Tawana Brawley, the black woman who falsely accused four white men of raping her in 1987. Just like Smollett, Brawley claimed racial slurs were used during her attack, which generated immediate media attention and the call for black activists to rally behind her.

Similar sentiments were felt during the Duke Lacrosse Case in 2006, when a black woman named Crystal Gail Mangum falsely accused white players from Duke University of raping her and calling her racial epithets.

These public scandals abused the resources of a social justice movement that would go on to be unfairly tarnished these lies. For example, comments under my previous tweets initially standing up for Smollett are already being mocked and ridiculed. I can only imagine how this will impact the Black and LGBTQ community as a whole.

But despite all of this, I don’t regret initially believing Jussie Smollett.

Like many, I strive to believe victims—especially those from marginalized communities. As a black gay man, Smollett’s account pulled at my heartstrings because I have experienced acts of racism and homophobia in my personal life. I think one would have to be a little jaded to instantly presume the worst in people who haven’t displayed any prior reasons for you to do otherwise.

Until now, Smollett was an appreciated voice for racial justice and LGBTQ equality. He was a role model and a positive example of how to be Black, out, and proud in Hollywood. His breakthrough role in Empire as Jamal Lyon was a revelation and inspired many, including myself, to keep having conversations with my black family about inclusion and acceptance. To have not believed Smollett in the beginning would have felt like an abomination to all that I stood for: To believe victims and stand up for Black and LGBTQ people under attack.

It now appears as though Smollett may have betrayed that sacred trust. For whatever reason, he might have felt the need to mislead his devout following to fuel a crazy obsession with fame. Or was he seeking to make a political or cultural point, but in the worst kind of way based on a lie that would be revealed as such once it was investigated?

Whatever the truth of this, whatever Smollett did, the amount of poisonous backlash it is producing is also instructive.

Too much of the credibility of current social justice work done by local activists is falling on the backs of famed influencers who have proven to be faulty. We saw this during the #MeToo movement with actress Rose McGowan and her self-serving feuds that sometimes distracted real efforts being carried out by creator Tarana Burke. Or the countless times the Black Lives Matter movement is called into question by the controversies that revolve around activist/writer Shaun King.

Now with Smollett’s scandal, intersectional activism calling for the protection of LGBTQ people of color will continue to be further polarized due to this unnecessary drama he’s brought our way.

Fame is a terrible drug, one that ruins the most promising people who get caught up in it. The cult of celebrity has proven itself once again of derailing the true work of everyday people fighting to survive. It’s high time that we begin to re-focus our attention on their efforts, and not the red carpet draw of those awaiting a close-up for being adjacent to the activism.

While I won’t let this devastating blow stop me from believing true victims, I will also no longer rely on woke celebrities to dictate the narrative. Give the power back to the people, not Hollywood.

Confusion swirled on Friday when Chicago police released two suspects, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, without charges, and Chicago P.D. spokesman Anthony Guglielmi has since confirmed that “the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that authorities now believe Smollett hired the Osundairo brothers—who themselves have worked with Smollett on Empire—to stage the attack.

Smollett’s representation has denied this. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” read a statement released by lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson Saturday night. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

According to CNN, police were able to obtain a hardware-store receipt for the rope placed around Smollett’s neck in the attack, as allegedly purchased by the brothers. A raid of their home turned up bottles of bleach (Smollett claimed his attackers poured a chemical substance on him), as well as “a black face-mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat,” and other items, according to a police inventory list described by CBS Chicago. TMZ also reported that a phone turned over by one brother features a call between him and Jussie prior to the incident.

The statement from Smollett’s attorneys added, “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.” In an earlier interview with G.M.A.’s Robin Roberts, Smollett said he had hesitated to come forward out of fear he wouldn’t be believed. “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Police have reached out to Smollett’s representation for a follow-up interview with the star."

Because of what the brothers shared with investigators, Smollett has escalated from sympathetic victim to suspect overnight.

It is now being widely reported, including sources from CNN and the Chicago Tribune, that Smollett masterminded this hoax attack that has garnered international attention and that investigators privately questioned the veracity of Smollet’s story from the outset.

Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, two bodybuilders who worked as extras on the blockbuster “Empire” television show and reportedly worked out with Smollett, told Chicago investigators they “rehearsed the attack” on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett in advance of the January 29 attack.

Smollett, 36, who is Black and openly gay, promised his friends $4K to stage a racist and homophobic beatdown. The Chicago Tribune reports the embattled Smollett paid the two brothers $3500 for the “attack” before they flew home to their native Nigeria. They were allegedly promised another $500 when they returned to the United States.

The brothers told the Chicago Police Department that the attack was supposed to take place before January 29. The brothers also said Smollett paid for the rope that served as the noose at the local Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago on the weekend of January 25.

One of the brothers said he held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett when he reportedly went to a Subway shop to grab something to eat at 2 a.m. The other brother was ordered to don a red hat and shout racial and homophobic epithets at Smollett. The hat was also purchased that same weekend as the other supplies were bought, the Tribune reports.

Smollett’s story exploded into national headlines when he told police his attackers called him a “f*****” and “n******” and then doused him in an unknown “chemical substance” that we now know is bleach.

The men were spotted in surveillance cameras in the moments leading up to the attack and were tracked by their use of Uber and other means. But when they were arrested and questioned, they were released Friday without being charged nor cited.

The Tribune reports the men are cooperating fully with police and are being barricaded at an unknown location for their safety.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement saying Smollett is “angered and devastated” by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago."

Chicago police said their investigation into the Jan. 29 apparent hate attack on Jussie Smollett has “shifted,” the Associated Press reported on Saturday, while attorneys for the Empire actor said he is “angered and devastated by recent reports” claiming police believe he orchestrated the attack.

The developments came hours after multiple outlets reported that the two brothers who were arrested and released without charges in the case have reportedly claimed that the Empire star paid them to stage the incident.

According to CBS Evening News, a police source told the outlet on Saturday that the brothers said Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged incident and purchase the rope that was found around the star’s neck.

CNN reported on Saturday that two Chicago police sources said investigators believe Smollett paid the men in exchange for carrying out the attack and the men are now fully cooperating with authorities.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement, according to the AP. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

“Detectives have reached out to his attorneys hoping to speak with him again,” Chicago police spokesman Thomas J. Ahern later said in a statement to PEOPLE.

Smollett responded to the reports in a statement released by his attorneys on Saturday. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” Smollett’s lawyers said. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continues. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” Smollett’s attorneys added. “At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

A rep for Fox, which airs Empire, had no comment, while the brothers’ attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.

On Friday evening, Chicago Police Department chief communications officer Guglielmi said on Twitter that the men had been released after being called in for questioning by authorities.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging,” he tweeted.

“Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi added."

The brothers, who worked as extras on “Empire,” were arrested and questioned by Chicago police last week but were released on Friday and are said to be still co-operating with the investigation.

In the wake of their release, a Chicago police spokesman says the “trajectory of the investigation” has shifted and have reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview. Sources for Deadline allege that said new trajectory involves Smollett being “an active participant in the incident”.

Lawyers for Smollett have denied he had any role in the assault last month which he alleges was carried out by two white men, saying in a statement:

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

Not only has Smollett condemned the not-so-dynamic duo he has also severely diminished cause of both Black Americans and Gays.

There is no doubt that such crimes do actually occur but this crybaby Hollywood Liberal has used the real pain and anguish suffered by actual victims as a prop in his own twisted game to remain famous. He should be prosecuted and handed a stiff prison sentence.

Democratic presidential dreamer Kamala Harris called the incident “outrageous,” while another potential 2020 nominee Cory Booker immediately branded the incident a “modern-day lynching,” as part of a wave of sympathy and support for Smollett, who has a history of progressive activism.

While Kamala Harris is a side show for the Deocrats, Booker and Ocasio-Cortez were seen as potential leaders and would have featured heavily in Democrats promotions, both now are tainted beyond repair.

They have shown their Racist, Prejudiced sides, not what America needs.

Two Nigerian brothers were arrested and then released this week in connection with the incident on January 29. Citing law enforcement sources, CNN reported on Saturday night that they are now “cooperating fully” with the investigation, in which Smollett has become the chief suspect.

Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo are two recurring extras on the set of the TV show ‘Empire,’ in which Smollett stars, and know him personally.

In the hours after the story was published, Smollett released a fresh statement, not just reiterating that he was a genuine casualty, but insisting that he is now being re-traumatized.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said his legal team.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The lawyers added that the involvement of an unspecified Osundairo brother who Smollett had hired as a personal trainer to “ready him physically for a music video” was “impossible.” They added that their client has “no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources.”

Persistent doubts

According to Smollett, last month’s attack took place as he was returning home from a Subway sandwich shop at 2am. The actor, who is black and gay, was purportedly accosted by two white men, who called him “Empire fa**ot” and “Empire ni***r”. The men allegedly tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on his head, as one of them shouted “This is MAGA country!” in reference to Donald Trump’s political slogan.

However, his account of the incident aroused almost immediate skepticism from some quarters, both official and general. Did two Empire-watching Donald Trump supporters happen to be randomly wandering through a deserted Chicago neighborhood when it was -14C outside, carrying a noose and chemicals, and then stumble upon Smollett? Or were they perhaps master stalkers, who could have predicted that the actor would have gone for a tuna sandwich and a salad – both of which remained intact after the attack – at this late hour?

Police also said that they didn’t manage to locate anyone matching the description provided by Smollett, despite studying hundreds of hours of footage from one of the most advanced CCTV systems in the world. Nor could they document the moment of the attack. Two silhouetted figures were identified in the vicinity, but their role remained unclear.

Doubts were compounded when Smollett refused to hand over his phone in the aftermath, and instead presented investigators with a PDF file purportedly showing a record of his calls, which detectives could not consider tamper-proof.

‘MSM uncritically accepted his lies’

Reports over the last week that cited inside sources have put together a radically different account of events.

Smollett purportedly paid $3,500 to the black LGBT-supporting Osundairo brothers to buy a noose and bleach, and play-act the attack, inflicting superficial injuries. Police have found evidence of them buying the rope, while bleach was located during a search of one of their houses.

The Osundairos, who appear to be the shadowy figures in the surveillance footage, departed on a flight to Nigeria hours after the alleged incident, before being arrested the moment they touched down back in the US.

The details have resulted in much gloating online, not least from those claiming that because the story fitted a convenient political narrative, all attempts at critical analysis were abandoned.

However, the story could result in more than just humiliation and career damage for Smollett, who may face up to three years in jail if he is found to have filed a false police report. It also brings attention to an earlier incident, in which police investigated a potential terrorist attack when the actor received an envelope containing white powder at his work address last month. The substance turned out to be ground-up aspirin."

After rumors and speculation, police sources spoke out on Saturday to indicate that they now believe Smollett staged the attack on himself. The current thinking is that brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo allegedly were paid for their part in the staged attack.

""A source close to the investigation tells CBS News that 2 brothers — arrested & then released — told detectives that Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack, & that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store,"" CBS News' David Begnaud wrote on Saturday.

The Blast reports that the Osundairo brothers each filed for bankruptcy back in 2016. In the filing, which was made in Chicago, indicated that both brothers have business and student loan debts.

Abel allegedly had $72,771 in liabilities, with $39,000 of that being student loan student loan debt. He allegedly only had $142 in monthly income, which led to $300 in debt monthly.

Ola claimed $161,481 in debt, with $85,000 of that being student loan debt. He is said to have only made $160 per month at the time.

The brothers also owned a party store, It’s Party Time, together, but it now closed.

The bankruptcy proceedings apparently went off as expected, and each brother was discharged several months after the filing.

These financial struggles fit into the narrative police are suggesting, in which Smollett hired them to attack him. However, the Empire star adamantly denied the assumption in a statement to press from his attorneys.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the attorneys wrote. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

According to Page Six, Jussie Smollett allegedly promised to pay two of his friends $4,000 to stage an attack of a racist and homophobic nature. The men reportedly rehearsed the staged attack.

The two attackers, a pair of Nigerian brothers, reportedly told Chicago police that the attack was orchestrated by Smollett. They allege that the attack was supposed to happen before January 29, as they had practiced it days beforehand.

As many fans will remember, Jussie was taken to the hospital after claiming he was the victim of a hate crime last month. The actor told police that he was stopped by two masked men, who poured a chemical substance on him, physically assaulted him, and then put a rope around his neck, all while screaming racist and homophobic slurs at him.

However, the suspects were taken into custody and later released, after they allegedly told cops that it was Jussie who was behind the attack. The two even presented the rope that they used to put around his neck.

The brothers were released without charges, and are said to be fully cooperating with police officers while staying at an undisclosed location. Cops claim that the men have a “relationship” with Jussie, and have even worked on Empire with him.

Chicago police have stated that if Jussie Smollett is proven to have orchestrated the attack against him, he will face charges of his own.

After reports that the actor may have paid his attackers to stage the entire incident, Smollett released a statement via his lawyer, revealing that he was the victim of a hate crime, and is now feeling victimized yet again due to the allegations against him.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” Smollett’s lawyers continued.

After the attack, Jussie Smollett received an outpouring of love from his family, friends, co-stars, fans, and other celebrities, who spoke out in disgust over the attack."

Former Uptown Entertainment president Andre Harrell—the man responsible for Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, and Heavy D—is taking over the legendary label and promising to bring the noise. But can he fight through the nostalgia and lead Motown into the 21st century? By Anthony DeCurtis. Photographs by Dana Lixenberg

""You know how Jeffrey Katzenberg became Disney? That's what I want to do. Like, how you felt Jeffrey had a passion about Disney—his Mickey Mouse watches, Disney sweatshirt, Disney tie. That's what I'm talking about. I will be at the Motown Cafe. I'll make Motown ties, watch­es, sweatshirts. I intend to make Motown the black Disney,"" Andre Harrell says with a smile. ""You might as well start calling me Walt.""

Harrell, 35, is obviously a man with a plan. Good thing, too. He's stepping into one of the most vis­ible jobs in the entertainment industry: president and CEO of Motown Records. ""It's always been a dream of mine to head up Motown,"" he says.

Yet the lofty position confronts Harrell with a critical challenge. Motown has fallen far from what it once was. Aside from the monumental Boyz II Men, Motown has increasingly become a sound­track for nostalgia, much more redolent of the past than the present. It's so hard to say good-bye to yesterday, indeed. Harrell, a product of the hip hop generation, knows his job is to introduce Mo­town—music, television, film, video, animation, and new media—to tomorrow.

A Bronx native, he got his start in the early '8os as half of the rap duo Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. (He was Dr. Jekyll.) After moving over to the business side of the business, he hooked up with rap mogul Russell Simmons and soon landed a top spot at Simmons's company, Rush Communications, where he worked with the likes of Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J, and Whodini.

Harrell stepped out on his own in 1986, when he launched his own label, Uptown Entertain­ment, as part of a joint venture with MCA. At Uptown, Harrell defined a contemporary R&B sound for the hip hop age, bringing the world Guy, Heavy D, Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Al B. Sure!, Father MC, and most recently, Soul for Real (with whom he had his first No. 1 pop hit, ""Candy Rain""). He produced the 1991 film Strictly Business, and he coproduces the hit Fox series New York Undercover.

Successful as the artists on his label proved to be, Harrell has felt constrained in his efforts to make them pop superstars, both by his arrange­ment with Uptown's parent company, MCA, and by the troubling racial politics of the music busi­ness in general. Moving to Motown, which is now based in Los Angeles and owned by PolyGram, presents Harrell with the opportunity to put at least some of these issues behind him. At Motown, Harrell says, he'll have more people, more prerogative, more punch.

Seated on a couch in the living room of his Upper West Side New York apartment, dressed simply in a black shirt and white slacks, Harrell focused squarely through his blue shades on what must be done. A framed photo of a serious-looking Harrell arm-in-arm with Mickey Mouse sat on an end table.

Clearly a man who enjoys control, Harrell was soft-spoken and intent. He didn't want to be mis­understood. ""Am I correct?"" he would ask. ""Do you follow me?"" He leaned forward, and his voice rose with passion as he discussed his frustrations with MCA. Otherwise, he slipped back into the pil­lows of his sofa and spoke as if he was envisioning his future life in a dream.

Harrell knows he has as much on the line as Motown, if not more. All eyes will be on him. It's one thing to say you would've done something if only you'd gotten the chance. It's quite another to get the chance and have to do it.

""Every record has gotta be right,"" he said. ""I'm trying to sign stars. I'm not gonna have wack-juice on me. Never did, never will.""

What has Motown meant to you over the years? When was the first time you knew what it was?

The first true Motown experience I had was when the Jackson 5 were on the Ed Sullivan Show. I think it might've been, like, 1969, '70. They sang ""Stand!"" and ""I Want You Back."" I had never seen a black teenager on television—it was incredible. After that, I realized who the Motown artists were. My parents listened to them: the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, the Temptations.

What did the company represent for you?

Motown has always been the epitome of black excellence and artistry. Stevie sang about love in the most sensitive way, as well as telling about the plight of his people. Marvin sang about the plight of his people and his internal fight, but he sang about love in a very sexy way. They were major influences.

Speaking of Stevie Wonder, he made a strong album last year and nothing happened with it. Can Motown sell a Stevie Wonder record in this day and age?

The Four Tops, the Temps, and, especially, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross—these are national trea­sures. You have to treat them like events. Stevie Wonder, he's someone I would do an Unplugged with. Or a couple of years ago, it was Stevie's 3oth anniversary in show business. You could have got­ten Stevie Wonder a television special. We could have had artists pay tribute to him—pop artists, rock artists, R&B artists, rap artists, everybody could have participated. And there's probably no other female, black or white, who's as fabulous as Diana Ross, who epitomizes the glamour and excitement of a star diva.

What about new directions? What makes Motown happen in the '9os?

Motown has to become the lifestyle label for the times that the active record-buying audience—the audience who's 15 to 3o—is living in. One of the ways you do this is by putting out records that are in the groove that that audience is living in. Like if Mary J. Blige was a Motown artist, Motown would have some of her imaging on it. It's that young, hip hop—soul, Generation X energy. Same thing if Jodeci was on the label. Back in the day, Motown talked to everybody in the ghetto—and it talked to the rest of the world too.

""WHEN YOU THINK OF MOTOWN NOW, YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF ANDRE HARRELL. I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR MOTOWN, I'M GONNA BE MOTOWN.""

That sounds like the philosophy you espoused at Uptown.

The thing that [Motown founder] Berry Gordy led the way with is the idea that the label head becomes the image of the label. Myself, I allowed whatever celebri­ty occurred in my career to happen through the artists. I was so consistent with the kinds of artists who were on my label, after a while, it was, like, ""Who's behind all this?"" I was behind it.

Going into Motown, my plan is this: When you think of Motown now, you're gonna think of Andre Harrell. I'm not gonna work for Motown, I'm gonna be Motown—in the way I dress, the records I put out, the causes I choose to get involved in, the artists from the past, the artists who are there now, and the artists in the future. Like I lived Uptown Records, I'm gonna live Motown Records.

But you, Russell Simmons, Sean .""Puffy"" Combs—and Berry Gordy before you—are entrepreneurs. You're identified with the companies you founded. With this, you're stepping into something—

—that's already existing. I'm gonna be Motown for this generation of young-adult record buyers. Motown was the blueprint. Berry Gordy was the blueprint for what I became.

Were you conflicted about leaving Uptown?

I had tremendous conflict. It was like I was walking away from my works of art. There will never be another Mary J. Blige—it's rare to find a queen. There will nev­er be another Jodeci. There'll never be another Heavy D. But I have to go, because Motown gives me the power I need to go to the next level. I have to make African-American superstars. At Uptown, I was able to make black icons, but they were icons only to black people.

[I was] trying to grow Uptown, to have indepen­dence, to be able to say, ""This act is getting ready to be a worldwide star, and I'm gonna take all my resources, and we're gonna march to this one beat."" I was trying to do that for nine years. Between me and the corpora­tion, I could never get it to happen.

In terms of support from MCA?

I think MCA, after a period, wanted some of these things to happen. For whatever reasons, though, the execution between the two sides never worked. The biggest record I ever had was Jodeci's [1991] Forever My Lady—3 million.

When [Arista president] Clive Davis got in the game, I felt myself shrinking. Once he got in business with LaFace [L.A. Reid and Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds] and [Dallas Austin's] Rowdy Records and Puffy [Bad Boy Entertainment], Davis's commitment and his exe­cution were taking those artists where I wanted my artists to go. I wanted Mary J. Blige to sell the 7 million that Toni Braxton did.

Jodeci came to me because I had Al B. Sure! So they figured, ""He knows how to do this. We wanna be down with him."" They drove 13 hours, sat in my lobby for eight hours just to meet me. Now, I feel like, with Arista being involved with LaFace and the other labels, they sold 7 million Toni Braxtons. They sold 6 million TLCs. I'm, like, if I can't sell these kinds of records, I'm gonna slowly shrink. I was catching heat from my artists, who wanted that kind of stature. I would bring that frustra­tion to MCA, and we couldn't seem to come to terms.

Was the idea, ""Well, Andre's doing fine. He's doing a cou­ple of million here, a couple of million there. He's covered. Were gonna invest somewhere else""?

I felt like a figurehead. I had all this energy around me—like, I was the Man. I was the founder and chairman of Uptown Records, a major, culturally influen­tial entertainment company for African-Americans in the '9os. But I didn't feel like the Man, because I could­n't put my finger on the button that would really make it happen. I don't want to be in that position anymore. I need to have more control. I need to be responsible for the big picture. And being at Motown positions me to create a truly black pop company. I got a film divi­sion, a television division. I got green-light power for small movies. I don't have to ask anybody.

What are your plans with Gordy?

We're gonna do a series of commercials—print and television. He endorses me. We spoke yesterday for about an hour, and he said, ""Any advice I can give you about where we go from here, feel free to call me."" We're gonna spend time together and talk about his history with the elder stars. I feel as if I've had a tremendous amount of experience working with stars' drama and ego, but we're talking a whole 'nother level of stars. I've never built a superstar. There're superstars at this house.

How do you build superstars?

If black stars are gonna have a shot at becoming pop stars, it's gonna be because the chairman of the company is committed to them—and because their music is his personal taste. That's what I'm bringing to black music, to black musical stars. Not just their art form but their plight as African-American men and women.

What you're describing is a role that black executives play, but aren't they often frustrated in their attempts to rise at most record companies?

I can't talk about it enough, how few black execu­tives get to control their playing field. Black music is becoming the music of the popular culture. Because of that, companies are repositioning their priorities and trying to get in the game. But as black music becomes more important, there should be more black presidents and black chairmen. As soon as the black executive's artist reaches platinum, suddenly the artist and man­ager have to deal with the president of the corporation, because he controls the priorities at pop radio. The black executive becomes obsolete. As his music gets bigger his power diminishes. He's more or less told, ""Go find the next act and establish it.""

It's an emphasis on the creative—

—as opposed to the business. That's why young black executives don't get to become the old chairmen—the wise men who've seen it and done it. They get to stay hot black executives so long as their instincts are hot. But this is a lifestyle business—only a few of us, black or white, are going to be cool enough to have great in­stincts our whole career.

The black executive is not given the opportunity to become the business and the music. Why not? Why shouldn't he be the one that everybody reports to? When you get an act that sells 5 million—at a major compa­ny—the black executive's out of the room. But when there's some sort of problem, the major label looks at the black executive: ""Why can't you handle this act?"" When the artist hires a violent manager and the violent manager is coming up to the record company, the label's, like, ""How did it get to this?"" How? Because they [the white executives] couldn't see it coming. Because they re not sensitive to his issues. By then the relation­ship between the record company and the artist is dys­functional. And then the black executive gets blamed and fired. But they created the monster.

When I had the artist, I talked to his mother, his girl­friend, his babies' mother with the two children, dealt with his drug counselor, and whatever other dysfunc­tional Generation X problems he has. He'd call me late at night.

But he feels like they're just businesspeople. And they don't understand. And they might be racist. He's comin' with all that energy. Even if they like him as a person, he still has goo years of issues he has to get over to accept them. And they have a lot of work to do to gain his trust and respect.

So what are your immediate plans?

I will be moving to Beverly Hills. I'll have a house out there for a 12-to-18-month period, and I'll be bicoastal between the New York and L.A. offices. Then I'm moving the company to New York. I'm going to have a satellite office in Atlanta—A&R-oriented. I'm going to build a recording studio in New York, Motown Studios.

Any new musical directions?

The sound I'm going for now is soul. I'm looking for voices that sound like 400 years of slavery and then some. I'm looking for that inspirational, take-us-out­-of-our-plight, Aretha Franklin, Bill Withers, Al Green voice. I'm looking to build those kinds of stars now.

What about the younger acts on Motown? Have you met with Boyz II Men?

No. Those meetings will come after I execute the deal. Boyz II Men are the biggest group I've ever seen. I don't know what I'm bringing to the party except to keep them from goin' crazy from the level of success they've had. They probably need a break, a little time out to lead their personal lives. Outside of that, that for­mula is working. Queen Latifah, I'd like to bring her record sales up to match her celebrity. Zhané I'd like to give a little bit more image. I'm gonna bring Johnny Gill back—he had a fabulous first album. And I'm excit­ed about working with Michael Bivins. He's tremen­dously talented, and if he and I get together, we can real­ly do some important things.

Are you apprehensive?

I got a lot of work to do. But no problems. Making hits is not a problem. I'll be making some noise real quick. And I ain't gonna stop makin' noise until I'm done.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs early Jan. 29, 2019. Chicago police said on Saturday, Feb. 16, ""the trajectory of the investigation"" into the reported attack on Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the ""Empire"" actor. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the ""Empire"" actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett's attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett's attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Chicago police insiders told TMZ that authorities are keeping a close eye on two Nigerian brothers, who were arrested and questioned about the attack before being released on Friday, to make sure that Smollett doesn't try to contact them.

Investigators have said they believe Smollett may have paid Empire extras Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo $3,500 to assault him in an orchestrated, rehearsed attack on January 29.

Sources say Smollett initially agreed to sign complaints against his assailants, but declined to do so once he heard that Abel and Ola were the men in custody because he knew them and felt bad for them.

Reports of a possible grand jury emerged hours after the Chicago Police Department said Smollett was not yet being considered an official suspect, despite insider claims to the contrary.

'We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question,' CPD said in a statement to TMZ.

'After new developments, we've reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.'

Smollett has furiously denied claims that he orchestrated the assault and said 'nothing could be further from the truth'.

A grand jury will hear the Jussie Smollett case next week, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation into the Empire actor's alleged hoax attack

Reports of the grand jury came just after it was claimed that the two Nigerian brothers Jussie Smollett is accused of paying $3,500 to attack him, Abimbola 'Abel' (left) and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo (right), allegedly told police that the trio rehearsed the assault beforehand

Smollett (above four days after the attack) had claimed that the assailants 'yelled out racial and homophobic slurs' as they tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance that he suspected was bleach on him

Abel and Ola reportedly told detectives that the 2am attack was supposed to happen earlier and that they did a practice run beforehand, according to CBS Chicago.

Sources said one of the brothers put a rope around Smollett's neck and poured bleach over him while the other wore a red hat and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

THE FULL STATEMENT FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S ATTORNEYS Lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson issued the following statement on Jussie's behalf on Saturday night: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. 'One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. 'Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.' Advertisement

The brothers, who reportedly had a relationship with Smollett and were extras on Empire, told authorities they had bought the items used in the attack at the actor's direction.

Smollett had told police that on January 29, two assailants tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him while yelling 'Empire f****t' and 'Empire n*****' at him.

That narrative, however, is now under serious scrutiny by investigators, who reportedly have evidence that Smollett directed his 'attackers' to buy the rope used in the 'assault' at a local hardware store.

Documents prove two Nigerian brothers, who work as extras on the highly rated Fox drama, bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Chicago.

Sources said that the brothers used Smollett's money when they made the purchase on the weekend of January 25.

They also bought two red plain hats that they wore during the alleged attack, according to sources close to the investigation.

Police believe that the red hats were purchased at a local beauty supply store in the Uptown section of Chicago.

'We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,' Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.

'We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.'

Chicago police are now ‘eager to speak to Jussie Smollett’ in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

‘We have been in touch with Smollett's attorneys,’ a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said. ‘We made our intentions clear.'

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE Here is what we know so far about the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett and the ongoing investigation by the Chicago Police Department. Since CPD is not commenting citing the ongoing probe, the public has been left to rely on Smollett’s version of events. On January 29, Smollett was allegedly assaulted by two men at around 2am. Reports indicated that he was allegedly beaten up and had a noose tied around his neck. The alleged assault took place as Smollett was on his way home after buying a sandwich at a local Subway. Initial reports indicated that the attackers were ‘white men’ who yelled ‘This is MAGA country’ while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and pouring bleach on him. But during an interview with Robin Roberts of ABC’s Good Morning America, Smollett denied that his assailants wore red MAGA hats. Smollett also told Roberts that contrary to reports, his ribs were not broken as a result of the incident. After the assault, some began to wonder if Smollett concocted the entire story. That there were those who doubted Smollett stems from a number of factors. A Chicago Police spokesperson said on the day after the alleged attack that investigators were unable to find evidence of an assault. The only surveillance camera at the scene was pointed in the opposite direction. Smollett also phoned the police from his apartment rather than from the scene. When Smollett initially refused investigators’ request to hand over his phone, this raised eyebrows. Smollett then handed over his phone records, but they were redacted in order to protect the privacy of people not involved in the attack. On Friday, police arrested two Nigerian men in the connection with the attack - only to have them released later. Since both men are black, this has led some to be suspicious of Smollett’s claim that this was a hate crime. Information emerged later on showing that Smollett knew the two men who were arrested since they were extras on Empire. A theory floating around on social media stated that Smollett staged the attack because his character was being written off Empire. But the show’s producers and writers quickly refuted that claim. Source: Slate

Scene: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... but I was not hospitalized,' said Smollett (map with inset of the scene where the attack occurred just outside Smollett's apartment)

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were Abel and Ola Osundairo

Ola and Abel were picked up at O'Hare Airport while disembarking a flight from Nigeria on Wednesday night.

The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised another $500 upon returning, according to WBBM-TV.

Earlier on Saturday, Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Attorney Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, revealed in a radio interview on Thursday in Chicago that he is representing Smollett.

Monico, speaking on WGN's The Roe Conn Show, did not reveal how long he has been representing Smollet or in what capacity. Monico last month took over as co-counsel for Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer.

Michael Monico (above) revealed that he is Smollett's lawyer in a radio interview on Thursday

It came as police in Chicago suddenly released the two Nigerian extras on Smollett's show, who had previously been described as suspects in the attack, saying that 'new evidence' had emerged in their interrogations that requires further detective work.

'Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,' Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday night.

The Osundairo brothers' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, spoke briefly to reporters after their release, hinting that Smollett's legal future could hold difficulties.

'There's so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,' Schmidt said when asked if her clients had helped Smollett stage the attack. 'I'm going to let them tell their story when the time is right.'

Smollett has vigorously denied speculation that details of the attack were fabricated or staged, speaking out in an interview that aired on Wednesday just hours before the Osundairo brothers were detained.

It is unclear at this time what the Osundairo brothers told police that would alter the course of the investigation.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT COULD GET 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FILING A FALSE REPORT TO POLICE Mitchell Dutz, 18, was sentenced to three years in Illinois state prison for fabricating claims that three black men stole a car with a 13-month-old infant inside Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony. That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison. By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who 'transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.' Last week, a central Illinois man was sentenced to three years in state prison after he pleaded guilty to fabricating an Amber alert. On December 15, Mitchell Dutz, 18, told police that three black men stole his car with a 13-month-old infant inside. Dutz used a social media photo of a child he did not know to claim that there was a kidnapping, according to Peoria Journal Star. But police rescinded the Amber alert after it became clear that it was a hoax. Dutz pleaded guilty to motor-vehicle burglary and disorderly conduct. Last month, a Chicago woman was charged with a felony after she allegedly made a 911 call that turned out to be a 'swatting' incident. Keesha S. Ingram, 41, allegedly called police before dawn on December 11 to report that a man was threatening to shoot his wife in their home in Warren Township. Sheriff's deputies responded to the call. They arrived at the scene and set up a perimeter around the house. Illinois police have issued an arrest warrant for Keesha S. Ingram, 41, who has been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly calling police and fabricating claims that a man was threatening to shoot his wife After making contact with the residents inside, the deputies determined there was no incident to warrant an arrest, according to the Daily Herald. Authorities then determined that they were dealing with a 'swatting' incident whereby a person falsely reports an ongoing crime at a particular address in order to harass the individual who lives there. An investigation led back to Ingram, who is alleged to have known one of the people who lived in the Warren Township home. Investigators believe Ingram made the swatting call out of revenge against the victim, whom she accused of not paying her money that was owed to her. Ingram is still on the loose and is wanted for arrest, according to Patch.

Late on Friday, police sources said that cops had seized a bottle of bleach from Smollett's apartment, according to Fox News correspondent Matt Finn.

Meanwhile, new information surfaced about the Osundairo brothers, who in the course of 48 hours went from 'potential persons of interest' to 'potential suspects' to being under arrest because investigators had 'probable cause that they were involved in a crime' to being set free.

Since their release on Friday night, they have been staying at an undisclosed location.

Police said that the brothers were the two men who were seen on a surveillance image released to the public, and Smollett positively identified the two men in the image as his attackers in a televised interview.

The two brothers are both strongly opposed to President Donald Trump and fervently pro-LGBT, fellow Empire cast and crew members tell TMZ. Both men are said to be loyal fans of former President Barack Obama.

Smollett is said to be close with the brothers and would frequently approach them on set to discuss health and fitness.

Colleagues on the tight-knit Empire set said they had a hard time imagining that the Osundairo brothers could have been involved in the kind of homophobic and bigoted attack that Smollett described.

Abimbola, pictured, was booked on DUI and speeding charges in July 2015 according to Chicago arrest records. The brothers were picked up at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday

Police initially said that they tied the brothers to the reported attack using meticulous investigative efforts, including surveillance videos and information from ride-sharing companies.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett's luxury apartment block.

The brothers left Chicago for Nigeria hours after the attack.

Celebrities rally behind Empire's Jussie Smollett after he is 'brutally attacked' in Chicago Celebrities and fans alike rallied to lend their support to Jussie Smollett after the 35-year-old actor claimed he was attacked last month. Janet Jackson took to her Twitter to share a special message for the actor, along with a photo of the two of them together. 'Sending so much luv and healing energy your way @jussiesmollett. we know that you’ll continue to change the world,' added Fergie. The sentiment was shared by Shonda Rhimes, who said: 'Sending love, healing, and support to @jussiesmollett. We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this, REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE.' Naomi Campbell posted a impassioned plea to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to find the people responsible for the attack. Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack. We support you and pray that you find peace and justice,' said John Legend. 'This is heartbreaking and terrifying...please pay attention to what's happening here,' said Zendaya. 'Sending all my love to @JussieSmollett.' 'No words. Love to you @JussieSmollett,' added Margaret Cho. 'This is horrifying,' said Jamilah Lemieux. 'We love you @JussieSmollett. May justice be swift and unflinching.' '@JussieSmollett I love you,' said Tika Sumpter '@JussieSmollett praying you have a full and speedy recovery. So sorry this happened to you, added Raegan Gomez. Many condemned the racist and homophobic behavior and demanded justice. Ana Navarro said: 'I saw Jussie Smollett in Miami last week. I can't believe this happened. It is sad and disgusting and and deplorable.' The sentiment was shared by Reverend Al Sharpton, who added: 'The reported hate attack on my friend and brother, actor Jussie Smollett is despicable and outrageous. The guilty must face the maximum.' 'Sending so much love and prayers to you, @jussiesmollett. I’m in disbelief of what happened to you,' added Eva Longoria. 'It’s a senseless act that shall be met with justice! I can’t believe this is happening in 2019. This world has no room for hate. #AwaitingJustice' Others took the moment to throw criticism at 'gay jokes' and Kevin Hart's recent appearance on Ellen where he addressed the controversy surrounding his hosting the Oscars. Actor Ryan Jamaal Swain stated: 'This is why holding ""a little homophobic joke'""accountable is taken so FREAKING SERIOUSLY. To quote @amandaseales, you have to be overly confident...black gay men have to deal w/ not only racism but homophobia.' It is always abt duality and a form of respect. @JussieSmollett 'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks,' said Saeed Jones. 'Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'

Their shared apartment was also raided by police, who took away bottles of bleach, electronics, a red hat and a pair of Nike shoes.

The FBI is also involved in the investigation after Smollett reported receiving hate mail.

Federal investigators have taken the lead on the mail case, and are supporting Chicago police in the investigation into Smollett's report of an assault.

Police have been cautious in their official public statements about the case. At last report, investigators still officially considered Smollett a victim in the case.

Smollett has continued to angrily denounce any speculation that the attack did not occur as he described, ascribing racist motives to skeptics and saying that no one would doubt him if he had reported being attacked by non-white assailants.

'I will never be the man that this did not happen to,' he told ABC on Wednesday. 'I am forever changed.'"

""To put this disaster in perspective, the arena Trump spoke in can hold more than 19,000 people, but only 6,200 people attended. That's one-third capacity!

""Aw, poor Trump,"" Trevor Noah deadpanned at The Daily Show. ""For somebody who was born into wealth and never suffered a single consequence for his actions, this dude just cannot catch a break."" Coronavirus fears almost certainly depressed turnout, but Trump was also ""foiled by a bunch of meddling kids"" and K-pop fans, he laughed.

By the time Trump's helicopter landed back at the White House, ""it was clear that all of those empty seats really took a toll,"" Noah said. ""Honestly, it's weird to see Trump display emotion — it's actually uncomfortable,"" he added. ""But I think this experience was the first time Trump actually felt the full weight and severity of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jussie Smollett is not officially a suspect in the Chicago PD investigation, despite multiple sources inside the department who tell us he is squarely just that.

We reached out to Chi PD and asked if the status of the ""Empire"" star has officially gone from victim to suspect. We were told ... ""We have some information that needs to be corroborated and verified with the Empire cast member before we can answer this question. After new developments, we've reached out to his attorney and requested additional time to interview him.""

It actually makes sense ... the cops are playing the case close to the vest, so witnesses aren't influenced by police statements. As we reported, there was a sentiment early on in the Department Jussie's story didn't track, but officially they never let on.

As we reported, the 2 brothers with connections to both ""Empire"" and Jussie ""completely cooperated"" with cops during their interrogation, and they made it clear ... their participation was at the behest of Jussie.

Jussie's lawyer has indirectly lashed out at the brothers, doubling down that Jussie is a victim and ""anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Jussie Smollett‘s legal team has spoken.

Just a few hours after bombshell news reports hit the wire that indicated Chicago police were at least investigating the possibility that the Empire actor somehow staged and/or facilitated his alleged attack with the help of two acquaintances, the actor’s legal team has released a statement.

Related: Nigerian ‘Suspects’ Released Without Charges

And in the statement, attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson strongly deny the accusations that Smollett may have faked or made up the attack for some sort of personal gain or other reason.

The lawyers’ statement, in full (below):

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Wow.

That’s certainly a very strong statement to put out there — and it’s clearly at least beginning to show that Smollett isn’t backing down from what he says happened. Surely lots more will come out in this case soon…

What are your thoughts, Perezcious readers? Are the police on to something here? Or are they as crooked as can be, and can’t be trusted?

At the very least, what is now known is that early reports by Smollett and his representatives were likely false, including claims the assailants were white, and that they were Trump supporters.

At the time, NAACP President Derrick Johnson linked Trump to the alleged crime, saying the “rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric.”

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the “Empire” actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers say: “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.

Chicago police earlier Saturday said their investigation of the attack had “shifted” following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released from police custody Friday without being charged.

Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men was the actor’s personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The Jussie Smollett assault story took a strange turn in the past 48 hours.

It turns out Smollett’s story was likely fabricated as CNN reported this past weekend that Chicago Police believe Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault. The brothers who were arrested in connection with the assault last Wednesday were released without charges on Friday because of “new evidence.”

Smollett maintains that he is telling the truth as attorney’s for the Empire star said Saturday that Smollett is “angered” and devastated” by reports that he is familiar with the attackers.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

According to two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation, the two men were released based on this information.

Smollett has denied playing any role in his attack. In the initial January report, he claimed that the two men had been “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” with one putting a rope around his neck and pouring an unknown chemical substance on him.

Smollett, 36, claims he was attacked on January 29 around 2 a.m. by two white men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, doused him in a bleach-like liquid, hung a rope around his neck, and yelled ""This is MAGA country,"" before he was able to chase them away. He was seen on security footage entering his upscale apartment with an intact Subway sandwich and a noose around his neck (which he was still wearing when police arrived). Of note, Smollett's manager claims he heard the ""MAGA country"" slur - which makes him part of this.

While there was no footage of the ""attack"" despite Chicago's thousands of surveillance cameras, two ""persons of interest"" were captured on camera...

In a case that’s been growing stranger and more complicated by the day, Chicago Police now believe actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated his own alleged attack.

Per a CNN report, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were brought in on Wednesday as the lead suspects in the attack. After a round of interviewing and the threat of being charged with battery, the Osundairo brothers claimed that Smollet hired them to participate in the staged attack, paying them $4,000 for their assistance. They went on to paint a drastically differed picture of the incident, claiming to have bought the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a local hardware store and the red imitation MAGA hats at a beauty supply. They even rehearsed the attack a few days prior.

Smollett’s initial account of the attack claimed that he was accosted by two white men in ski masks and MAGA hats, yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him. In a recent statement, his lawyers maintained that the assault was real and that Smollett is “angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.” It goes on to reveal that one of the Osundairo brothers is a personal trainer that worked with Smollett and that “it is impossible to believe this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett has yet to directly address the new developments, but is cooperating with CPD investigators in new rounds of interviews."

While his high-priced lawyers are still desperately playing the victim card, it appears that Smollett paid the two Nigerian brothers who “attacked” him (and whom he clearly knows) in a conspiracy to create a hoax.

This is a fraud in which the mainstream news media might as well have been an unindicted co-conspirator. They, along with kindred spirits within the top ranks of the Democratic party, instantly went all in on supporting Smollett’s always implausible claim, subjecting it to basically zero scrutiny.

Since Smollett is black, gay, very anti-Trump, a celebrity, and, at least at that time, a hate-crime victim, whatever ability liberals may have had to see through his inherently absurd story was immediately stripped away. Those qualities, creating what I refer to as Smollett’s “Political Correctness Force Field,” acted like Kryptonite on the power of liberals to see what was always very obvious to us who are not blinded by the biography of the person making an allegation.

Before the media narrative dramatically changed, I wrote three columns pointing out the very clear problems with Smollett’s story, eventually making the case that everyone had been duped by Smollett. It did not require a whole lot of sleuthing on my part to figure out his story was wasn’t true. It only needed a modicum of common sense, and a lack of fear of being politically incorrect, which are two qualities in dangerously short supply among the mainstream news media.

This is hardly the first time that I have sniffed out clearly false stories where the national news media was too in love with the narrative to even properly examine it.

My favorite, which had a lot of the same red flags as Smollett’s hoax, was the viral story of a Santa Claus who claimed to have cradled a dying boy in his arms as he gave him a final Christmas gift. That absurd narrative instantly crumbled like one of Santa’s uneaten cookies left out over Christmas Eve, partly because even Santa didn’t have as much of a PC force field protecting him as Smollett did.

Here is a handy math equation that I use on these types of stories, which I highly recommend for the news media so that they don’t keep falling for such obvious bullcrap…

Take the inherent plausibility of the story (on scale of 1-100, Smollett’s was about a 15)

Add to that number the lack of evidence corroborating it in comparison to what would be logically expected (Smollett’s case scored, at best, a 20)

Then divide that number by the hesitancy of the news media and/or the authorities to debunk the claim due to fear of political correctness (Smollett’s case was about as high as it gets, at least a 95)

If the final number you get is less than one, then the story is probably false (for the record, Smollett’s case scored less than a .4, which is the lowest number I have ever calculated for a major news event, except for the “Penn State Scandal,” which, based on my investigation, was, at best, a .2)

The real problem here is that this issue of media gullibility–at least when it fits their agenda, or a narrative they like—is much larger than the relatively minor ramifications of reporting a false story about Santa Claus, or a mostly unheard of TV actor. There have now been a series of these types of mishaps, specifically dealing with President Trump.

I strongly believe, as do the vast majority of conservatives, that the >allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were totally false and that the news media embarrassed themselves in that nightmare. You could make a strong argument that Smollett’s fraud further destroys the case against Kavanaugh because the entire argument on behalf of his primary accuser, Christine Ford, was that a prominent person would never tell a false story about being assaulted, especially not in such a public way.

The media also badly blew it in the “Covington Catholic” fiasco. Trump fans most definitely do not see it as a coincidence that in all three of these cases the news media clearly sided with the anti-Trump figures in the story and that, in all three situations, at least in the minds of “conservatives,” they were absolutely 100% wrong.

This loss of credibility has huge ramifications for the media’s ability to be taken seriously by Trump fans on nearly any other issue involving him. As I tweeted last night (to which I received a remarkably strong response), the news media, by lunging after these false anti-Trump narratives like spastic teenage boys with major impulse control issues, may even be unwittingly paving the path for his reelection.

Dear Media: Next time you’re baffled about why Trump supporters don’t believe a damn thing you report about the Russia scandal, please think back to how you handled Brett Kavanaugh, “Covington Catholic,” & Jussie Smollett… & then please blame yourself when Trump is re-elected. — John Ziegler (@Zigmanfreud) February 17, 2019

Jussie Smollett’s lawyers have released a statement pushing back on recent reports that the actor was somehow involved in the racist and homophobic attack against him late last month.

The statement was specifically responding to sources from the Chicago Police Department claiming that the Empire star paid two men to assault him.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” Smollett’s lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said in the statement.

The statement also says that one of the two brothers arrested on Wednesday, and later released on Friday, was Smollett’s personal trainer.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.” it said.

Smollett’s lawyers added that they were still willing to continue cooperating with the Chicago Police, but “have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation.”

Michael Rowe

These sources told CNN that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago. The sources said the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement following the discovery of “new evidence.”

The CPD has yet to release a new statement given the most recent reports. Earlier this week they pushed back on rumors and false news reports that claimed the attack on Smollett was staged.

“Media reports [about] the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” read statement from the department obtained by ESSENCE.

The statement added that the department has “no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed [Chicago Police Department] sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

We’ll continue to follow the story."

Smollett's legal team issued their statement Saturday night after CBS News, CNN and other outlets reported that the ""Empire"" actor allegedly paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. Now Smollett -- through his lawyers -- denies those reports and says he is being ""further victimized.""

Chicago police issued a statement on Saturday after the media reports confirming they had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" adding, ""We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told authorities he was attacked by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

Two law enforcement sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

One of the brothers had worked as an extra on ""Empire,"" and their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, has confirmed to The New York Times that they both knew Smollett.

Following the reported attack, Smollett's colleagues, civil and gay rights leaders, legislators and President Donald Trump expressed support and outrage at the attack that the actor described."

Come on dude. Two MAGA hat wearing rednecks walking around freezing Chicago at 2am with bleach and a noose beat him up and yelled “THIS IS MAGA COUNTRY!” That was the fakest story I’ve ever heard and anyone with any sense knew it was fake.

As soon as he refused to turn over his phone and left the rope around his neck until cops arrived the lie was exposed. Desperation to see the country through your twisted perspective made it seem logical to you.

Not true at all. The “information” given at the time was literally only from him. Taking accusations seriously is something everyone should do. But reporting on them without concrete evidence and telling everyone it it definitely happened when there’s no proof is wrong.

This might just be the worst take I've seen on the Jussie Smollett case. Justifying celebrities, journalists, and politicians spreading total misinformation to smear Trump because the media ran with a fake story is not making the point you think it's making. https://t.co/ndSLZ1I8uT

Not surprisingly, Reynolds has since deleted that tweet. But the responses are telling:

Given the information at the time, these are completely acceptable responses. If these were posted in the last 5 minutes, it would be entirely different. https://t.co/DChdlRQfo7

Broadcast journalist Shawn Reynolds, though, has volunteered to play defense for the Democrats, arguing that everything they said was a completely acceptable response at the time.

A lot of tweets from politicians and celebrities wishing to get in on the story haven’t aged well, and Caleb Hull passed around a few screenshots from Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, who called the alleged attack “a modern-day lynching.”

Incredibly, some journalists are excusing these responses as ""acceptable"" - despite the titanic smear against their political opponents that was based on zero evidence.

A Chicago police spokesman said : ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He added that police wanted to speak to Smollett again.

But they were silent on Saturday, when law enforcement sources said that Chicago Police believed ""Empire"" star Smollett, 36, who is gay, paid two black men to set up the assault. Police arrested the men, who are brothers from Nigeria, on Wednesday but released them Friday after discovering ""new evidence.""

Democratic presidential candidates jockeying for position in 2020 had a lot to say when actor Jussie Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago by two white men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs as they beat him.

The investigation into the alleged assault on Smollett took an unexpected turn on Saturday, when CNN reported that two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation had informed the news organization that Chicago Police believe Smollett orchestrated his attack.

On Wednesday, two brothers with alleged connections to the FOX series were arrested on suspicion but were releaed on Friday without charges. Although sources told CNN that Chicago Police have records of the brothers having purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a Chicago Ace Hardware store, law enforcement officials cited the discovery of ""new evidence"" as the reason for the release. CNN also reported from sources that Chicago Police believe the two men may have been paid by Smollett to commit the assualt, or were directly involved in arranging the attack with Smollett; and that both men are cooperating fully with authorities.

Smollett alleged to authorities that he was the victim of an attack on January 29 by the two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,"" who proceeded to pour ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene. At the time of the assault, Chicago Police announced that the attack was being treated as a ""possible hate crime.""

Last Thursday, ABC's Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett where the actor/singer went into detail about the assualt and what life has been like for him since that time. Speaking with interviewer/GMA co-host Robin Roberts, Smollett had this to say when asked about allegation being made that the attack was a hoax:

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

NBC News and the Chicago Tribune cited unnamed law-enforcement sources as saying police are investigating whether Smollett paid the brothers to help him stage the attack.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the ""Empire"" actor played a role in a reported assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers say: ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.



The lawyers' statement came after police said Saturday the investigation into the attack has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview Smollett.



Police released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked early Jan. 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.



Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett said he was cooperating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire"", James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Police released grainy images of two people they said were in the area at the time of the reported attack and said they wanted to question them.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the Nigerian brothers — one of whom they said worked on ""Empire""— at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

And then on Saturday, Guglielmi said the investigation had shifted."

Mark the tone of absolute certainty about an unconfirmed claim. Many other news outlets took the same tack. “Celebrities, lawmakers rally behind Jussie Smollett in wake of brutal attack,” reported ABC News. “Jussie Smollett Performs at Troubadour Just Days After Chicago Attack: ‘I Had to Be Here Tonight,’ ” read a Los Angeles Times headline. Many commenters linked the alleged attack to larger alleged sicknesses: “The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far-right America’s endgame,” tweeted GQ, in a sentiment echoed by many others.

Possibly it might be wise to establish whether an incident actually happened before leaping to conclusions about it. Remember Covington? Oh, right, that was almost a whole month ago.

The certain tone of the reports about an attack that Jussie Smollett may or may not have suffered was notable given the strange circumstances surrounding the actor’s claims. The Times would have been on firm ground if it simply added six letters — “says he” — between the words “Empire” and “was attacked.” And the Times is generally wary of publishing as fact information that may or may not turn out to be true. So why put their reputation at risk by abandoning normal practice? I and many others expressed doubt that any attack had transpired the way Smollett described it.

This week Chicago’s ABC7 News reported that “multiple sources,” presumably in the Chicago Police Department, had called the alleged attack “staged” by Smollett and two accomplices. CBS2 News and the Chicago Tribune made similar reports. A spokesman for the CPD rushed to say that the sources cited were “uninformed and inaccurate.”

That there might be more to this story than met the eye seemed evident from the outset. Who walks around Chicago on a frigid night with a rope and a bottle of bleach looking for gay black men to attack — but then suddenly turns and runs away from the victim without doing him much injury or robbing him?

Yet Cory Booker went on Twitter to say, “The vicious attack on Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.” Joe Biden: “What happened today to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.” Kamala Harris: “This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin.”

One progressive reaction that case might be a hoax is simple dejection. Our friends on the left are saddened that a gay black man perhaps wasn’t viciously beaten up by Trump-loving thugs.

How dismal it must be to be a progressive, to rest your political purview on extremely dark assumptions about the nature of the American psyche. No matter what the era or who is in charge, disaster always looms, and any weird anecdote that supports the larger doom narrative is eagerly, even devoutly, believed."

This is a lot different than when Smollett alleged he was attacked, when there were nothing but questions but we apparently knew everything.

If that sounds confusing to you, you clearly aren’t familiar with how liberals view anything that might involve conservatives or Donald Trump supporters in the year 2019.

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett said he was attacked on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him (Smollett is black and gay) along with the phrase “This is MAGA country.” According to his account, a strange chemical was thrown upon him and a rope was put around his neck.

It quickly became apparent there were some inconsistencies in Smollett’s story. Even though the attack happened in a Chicago neighborhood replete with surveillance cameras, it wasn’t caught on video. Smollett hadn’t called the cops from the scene and had requested, once they showed up, that they turn their body cameras off. The sandwich he had purchased from Subway before the alleged attack was completely intact and undamaged, according to reports. These were just a few of the irregularities that cast some measure of doubt upon Smollett’s story from the beginning.

But, more importantly, the story seemed to fit too neatly into a narrative — a narrative many people were willing to buy into before a single arrest was made. This was especially true for politicians and liberal celebrities, who didn’t seem to notice how tailor-made this whole attack was for their agenda. Not everything I mentioned above was public knowledge when they made their pronouncements, mind you, but Smollett’s allegation was tantamount to truth from the start, as far as they were concerned.

In fact, numerous declared or potential 2020 Democrat presidential candidates were willing to cosign this story before a single arrest had been made:

Where, then, are these individuals now that Chicago Police reportedly believe the 36-year-old “Empire” actor possibly orchestrated the attack with the help of two Nigerian brothers, one of whom appeared on the show?

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday, according to WLS-TV.

Celebrities, I am aware, don’t carry the same responsibilities that politicians do. Their political clout is questionable at best. The reason I include these tweets, however, is to demonstrate just how quickly influencers of all sorts jumped to the conclusion Smollett must have been attacked. Why? Because they seem to believe they believe they live in an America that’s irredeemably racist and homophobic, and has gotten more so thanks to Trump.

In short, these are people who are suffering from conservaphobia. To a large portion of the left, conservatives aren’t just people who diverge from them politically. They’re also not just racists, sexists, homophobes, transphobes, Islamophobes, anti-Semites and, well, deplorables. They’re people who are willing to physically threaten anyone who isn’t like them in order to maintain their privilege or white supremacy, whichever term you feel like using that day.

Take this Democrat campaign ad from 2017, which is a uniquely perfect distillation of conservaphobia. It literally shows a white person in a truck with a Trump bumper sticker and a Confederate flag trying to run down minority children:

That ad was in service of a politician who was later found out to have had a picture of a two men — one dressed as a Klansman and another in blackface — in his medical school yearbook. He later claimed he knew the picture wasn’t of him because he had dressed in blackface on another occasion and would have remembered if he dressed in blackface in that photo. But that’s a story for another day.

Picture this ad running 10, 20 or 30 years ago. It would have been unthinkable because it would have been laughable. Liberals have always tried to paint conservatives as regressive on issues of race, sexism, gay rights and the like. However, there was never that kind of widespread fear of those who believed different than them — the idea that conservatives are lurking around every corner and there’s no idea what they might do. The idea of conservatism as a pickup truck literally running down children would have been considered so far beyond the pale as to sink the candidacy of anyone who released this video. Not so much anymore, which is part of the reason Ralph Northam is governor of Virginia.

That’s why the Smollett case resonated even without evidence to politicians and celebrities of the liberal stripe. Now, mind you, we still don’t know what happened. Conservatives ought not fall into the same trap and conclude this was a setup based on the fact that police have shifted their investigation. Beyond the right of due process, we’ve seen what happens when you jump to conclusions.

As for the celebrities who loathe and fear conservatives, there’s nothing particularly new there. However, for politicians, this is inexcusable. They used a mere allegation to make a political point about an America they believe to be sick to the core — so long, that is, as the Democrats are out of power. Now that it’s looking more and more like there’s a possibility Smollett orchestrated the attack, there’s absolute radio silence. But the tune never changes. The other side isn’t just bigoted, it’s capable of the most unthinkable forms of violence and hatred. The left’s outrage over Smollett may have morphed into silent embarrassment, but conservaphobia will continue unabated.

Law enforcement sources with knowledge of the Smollett investigation told CNN on Saturday that police believe that Smollett hired two men to stage the attack on him.

And considering the amount of attention Smollett’s original report received from liberal celebrities and top Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, the latest development could be more than a little embarrassing for the country’s liberal political and entertainment establishment.

The men, identified by ABC News as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested on Wednesday as persons of interest in the investigation into Smollett’s claim that he had been attacked on Jan. 29.

The Osundairos were released 48 hours later without being charged, due to Chicago law enforcement’s discovery of “new evidence,” CNN reported.

ABC News reported that Chicago police said they were “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” after they released the Osundairos.

According to CBS News Chicago sources, the brothers told detectives that Smollett rehearsed the attack with them in the days leading up to Jan. 29.

Smollett reportedly told the Osundairos which items he wanted used in the assault and even paid for the rope used during the incident.

Smollett is reported to have paid the brothers $3,500 before they left for Nigeria later the same day of the incident. Smollett also promised them $500 more when they returned to the U.S, CBS reports.

Since the Osundairos were released from police custody they have been staying in an undisclosed location and are cooperating with the police, according to CBS.

The brothers’ information has changed the focus of the investigation, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement on Saturday.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview,” Guglielmi said, as reported by CBS.

Police raided the Osundairos’ home on Wednesday, the same day the brothers were arrested after returning from Nigeria.

CBS reported that the police seized a seized a black face mask hat, an “Empire” script, phone receipts, and bleach from the brothers’ home.

On Jan. 29, Smollett reported to police that he had been attacked near his apartment in Chicago. His two attackers allegedly shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before they put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical on him.

ABC reported that police say that the Osundairos “have a relationship” with Smollett. Deadline reported that at least one of the Osundairos seems to have already known Smollett and worked with him on “Empire.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement to ABC on Saturday night that their client is angry over doubts about the legitimacy of the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement reads.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett has previously expressed his anger over those who doubt his claims.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black (who attacked me), I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” Smollett said in an interview on “Good Morning America.”

Well, then.

While there’s still no way of knowing exactly what happened in the Smollett case, there’s no doubt that big-name liberals rushed to accept the original report of the attack unquestioningly.

In a Twitter post, before any investigation had a chance to take place, Booker said the Smollett attack was an “attempted modern-day lynching.

Pelosi called it “racist” and “homophobic” and an “affront to our humanity.”

According to his lawyers, Smollett will continue to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.

But no matter how it plays out, the celebrities and major Democrats who leaped at the chance to pontificate about the Smollett attack report should have learned a lesson about the potential for embarrassing themselves.

On Saturday, police said they were “eager” to speak with Smollett again and had been in touch with his attorneys as reports began to surface authorities believed the attack was staged.

In other words, that whole “This is MAGA country” story — Smollett’s claim that he was attacked by two apparent supporters of President Donald Trump — isn’t exactly holding up so well at the moment.

Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise. As conservative actor James Woods reminded us on Twitter as events were breaking on Saturday night, Smollett’s animus against President Donald Trump was very well known.

Woods retweeted one of Smollett’s perorations on the president and, well, let’s just say it’s not going to help his case.

Warning: There’s plenty of bad language ahead, including racial slurs. Reader discretion is advised.

Smollett’s tweet was in response to a Jan. 11 tweet by the president which made his case for the wall.

The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

I’m not quite sure how Smollett’s response qualifies as a rebuttal, but whatever works for him, I suppose.

RELATED: Coronavirus Silver Lining: Playboy Magazine's Print Edition Is No More

In fact, Smollett put forward his criticisms of the president as the reason he was attacked during an interview with “Good Morning America.”

“I come really, really hard against 45,” he said, referring to President Trump.

“I come really, really hard against his administration and I don’t hold my tongue.”

He also again implied that his attackers were inspired by the president.

“I can only go off of their words,” Smollett said. “Who says, ‘(bleep) ‘Empire,’ this MAGA country,’ (bleep) ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on to you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Well, we don’t know that, but the way things are trending, and given Smollett’s inconsistent stories, it probably wasn’t Trump fans.

Although I don’t know the political leanings of the two brothers who were questioned by Chicago police, WBBM-TV reported sources saying the men were paid $3,500 to orchestrate the attack on Smollett, which was rehearsed, and were to be paid $500 upon their return.

According to the same outlet, the two men also claim Smollett paid for the rope that was used in the attack.

How much stock to take in the story these gentlemen are telling is anyone’s guess. However, the narrative that this was some sort of Trump-based attack on an “Empire” cast member because he was black and gay and anti-Trump seems to be eroding by the hour.

What’s becoming more likely — although far from a foregone conclusion — is that Smollett, for whatever his own reasons may have been, orchestrated the attack and used it to further his animus against President Trump.

A battalion of liberal politicians and celebrities, also predisposed to hate the president, bought into the story from the get-go and amplified the message that Trump’s America™ was to blame. And then came the inconsistencies, and the raid, and the arrests, and now here we are.

Whatever the case may be, Smollett’s tweet didn’t age well.

But we can thank James Woods for bringing it to everyone’s attention again.

Two brothers told investigators they were paid by the ""Empire"" actor to stage the attack, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. The person asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the investigation.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement Saturday. “We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

On Sunday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted, ""While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what's been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""

Smollett’s attorneys issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in staging an attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

USA TODAY has reached out Smollett's representatives for comment on the investigation.

Pamela Sharp, Smollett's spokeswoman, told the Associated Press on Sunday that she had no updates ""as of now."" Another representative, Anne Kavanagh, said she couldn't comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was attacked while walking home through Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood late last month. He told police masked men tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and yelled racial slurs and “MAGA country!”

Police found records in the Chicago home of one of the men that showed they purchased rope from a hardware store that was used in the alleged attack, the source told USA TODAY.

Donald Trump Jr. targeted Smollett on Twitter after the revelations, saying the actor ""tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.""

Social media reaction to the latest development in the case ranged from mockery to disbelief.

""What a disgrace to MLK, Rosa Parks, and other people who actually suffered racism,"" ""Survivor"" alum Anna Khait tweeted.

""If this story turns out to be a hoax, orchestrated by Smollett to boost his career, he will have cynically betrayed supporters across the country and slandered a great city,"" tweeted David Axelrod, director of the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics and CNN commentator.

Police had questioned the two brothers, who are of Nigerian descent and have long lived in Chicago, last week after arresting them at O'Hare International Airport upon returning from international travel. They initially classified the brothers as suspects in the alleged attack Jan. 29.

Late Friday, the men were released without charges. Guglielmi cited ""new evidence” as the reason for the men's release.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom he hired to get him physically fit for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,"" the statement said.

Chicago’s ABC affiliate reported last week that investigators believed Smollett staged the attack because he was being written off the show.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the Chicago-based family drama, pushed back against the notion that Smollett was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement said.

Since launching the investigation, police have consistently described Smollett as a victim of an attack.

Earlier:I saw the rope 'and I started screaming,' Jussie Smollett says

Asked by USA TODAY on Saturday whether investigators still believed Smollett was a victim of an attack, Guglielmi stopped short of categorizing how investigators view the actor.

""We have some new information that we would like to corroborate,"" he said.

Smollett said in an interview Thursday with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that people who doubt him ""don't even want to see this is the truth.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” he said.

In earlier report by Smollett, he had claimed that his alleged attackers punched him hard while hurling racial and homophobic insults at him. He also claimed that his assailants poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck.

The actor who says he has been forever changed by the incident, also said his attackers said “This is Maga country,” he says they told him, referring to President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan, during the attack.

However, latest police report say the ‘Empire’ actor may have paid two men to carry out January attack on him.

According to Chicago Police source, Smollett’s alleged attackers are two Nigerian brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who had worked as extras on Empire. The alleged suspects were said to have told police that they were paid to take part in the 29 January attack.

Smollett’s lawyers he paid anyone to carry out the alleged homophobic and racist assault on him.

By Friday night, the Chicago police said that they arrested two Nigerian brothers who were involved with the alleged attack.

The New York Post spoke to the police, who told the newspaper that no charges were filed at that time. TMZ found out who the men were through its own sources, Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo. TMZ’s sources also contradict the police by saying the men face battery charges.

Cops noticed that the alleged attackers did some work on Empire, the show Smollett is well-known for. As of Sunday morning, the cops now say that Smollett paid these two men to orchestrate a pre-planned attack in order to garner attention, and they rehearsed the attack too, according to CBS Chicago.

JTA reports that Smollett has a Jewish father and African-American mother. After the alleged attack, a number of notable Jewish people and organizations showed their support.

In a tweet, The American Jewish Committee said it is “horrified by the assault on @jussiesmollet, whose attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs before putting a noose around his neck.”

It went on to say “We pray for his recovery and call on police to bring the perpetrators of this hate crime swiftly to justice.”

“This reported attack on Jussie is a disturbing reminder of the terrible homophobia and racism that plagues our society,” Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “We call on police to investigate this vile incident as a hate crime and work swiftly to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.”"

US actor Jussie Smollett’s lawyers have denied he had any role in an attack on him last month that he alleged was carried out by two white men.

They said the Empire star was “angered and devastated” by reports that the perpetrators were individuals that he is familiar with.

It comes after sources told US media that police believed he had paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on January 29.

Police today said the “trajectory of the investigation” had shifted and that they wanted to interview Smollett again.

On Friday, police released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement on Saturday, which said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Lawyers for Smollett later issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimised"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

Smollett has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country!"".

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on January 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up two brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late on Friday, police said they were no longer suspects.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from the actor's lawyers said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement added.

Police said they combed surveillance video but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Smollett has claimed that two men looped a rope around his neck and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him on Jan. 29. “They called me a f-----t, they called me a n----r,” Smollett said a ""Good Morning America"" interview on Feb. 14. “There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Questions about the veracity of Smollett’s account have been growing in recent days, however. Sources told the news station that at least one of the brothers bought the rope at Smollett’s request. Smollett also paid for the rope at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store, located in the Ravenswood neighborhood, the weekend prior to the incident, sources reportedly claimed.

The brothers, who appeared as extras on ""Empire,"" were allegedly paid $3,500 to participate in the attack, and then promised they would receive an additional $500 after returning from a trip to Nigeria, the sources claimed. They traveled to Africa shortly after the attack, per the report.

The brothers, who were arrested on suspicion of their role in the alleged attack earlier this week, after they came back from Nigeria, were released Friday.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the 'Empire' cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollet’s lawyers have said that he felt “victimized” by reports suggesting that the attack was staged.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement Saturday about the latest claims: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

(Michael Monico, Smollett's defense lawyer, said ""sorry but no comment"" in an email when contacted by The Daily Beast.)

Authorities’ recent skepticism of Smollet’s account marks a dramatic shift from their prior position, in which they disputed reports that the attack was a hoax."

With their clear sound, the absence of hiss, crackles, and pops, and excellent portability, there was no more room for improvement.

Not that the tech industry didn’t try, of course. Over the next 20 years, we saw formats like DAT and DCC (both using digital signals on magnetic tape), Sony’s MiniDisc (essentially music on a special floppy disc), HDCDs and DVD-Audio (evolutions of the CD), and the stillborn DataPlay disc.

The game-changer was the MP3, the digital format introduced in the early ’90s that set us on the road to iTunes and eventually today’s streaming music services. Now platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and the rest of them have libraries in excess of 50 million songs, all available instantly to anyone with an internet connection.

Just a few years ago, this kind of access to this much music was the stuff of science fiction. Now we take it for granted.

So that’s it, right? After 120 years of developing music storage products that started with Edison’s wax cylinders, we’re reached the end. There’s nothing that could possibly improve on streaming, right?

Not so fast. For a taste of the future, we once again need to look at the tech industry. While it may not be obvious at the moment, certain trends in tech could have massive implications for how we consume music in the future. In fact, we already had a taste of things more than a decade ago with the alternate reality game Second Life.

On Aug. 3, 2006, American singer Suzanne Vega assumed the role of a Second Life avatar to become the first major artist to perform in a virtual realm. Later that month, Duran Duran became the first major group to stage a live concert in-world for Second Life using custom-designed avatars. They were followed by an all-female Scottish punk band called The Hedrons who staged something in Second Life on Oct. 9, 2006, using tech that cost them a total of $2,500. The following September, The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was recreated in Second Life as they performed in front of 1,200 people in the real world.

At the time, these performances were regarded largely in the real world as technological proofs-of-concept and little more — if the real world noticed at all. But the tech industry has been vamping on these ideas ever since. How could a virtual world or new advances in virtual reality be adapted to the music fans of the future?

Rapper Chamillionaire and the band Hinder were among the first to hold live-yet-virtual meet-and-greets with fans inside Second Life. A group of U2 fans fastidiously reenacted a show from the Vertigo tour. Other artists have held listening parties this way. Duran Duran even created their very own virtual universe which, sadly, seemed to be a little ambitious for its time.

A number of companies have been working on technologies that allow people to be virtually transported to an actual concert in the real world. In August 2017, I lay in my bed with a giant Samsung VR headset weighing me down as I watched Coldplay perform a sold-out show at Soldier Field in Chicago. I had a “seat” right down front, and swiveling my head allowed me a complete look at the stadium as if I was actually there. The sound was bad and there was some latency with the visual display which caused dizziness and disorientation, not to mention that the headset was awkward and scared the dogs. But I did get the sense that I was there — almost.

The latest advances have come via Fortnite, the game that everyone seems to be playing. Its technology is far better than what we saw with Second Life in 2006. On Feb. 2, DJ Marshmello appeared in the game’s Pleasant Park and staged a virtual set for everyone who has in the game at the time. They were all able to witness the show and dance in front of Marshmello’s avatar.

Story continues below advertisement

How big was the audience? Perhaps as high as 10 million.

His set was short — it was all over in about 10 minutes — but the impact was huge. Streams of some Marshmello tracks increased by as much as — wait for it — 24,000 per cent. That is NOT a typo.

Whoa.

And not only that: Marshmello sold merch inside the game. Fans could buy things like a hoodie for just US$55. No merch figures have been released, but you gotta think with 10 million concurrent users in the game at the time of his set, more than a few might have shelled out for one.

To be fair, it’s easier for a DJ to present a virtual show because you’re dealing with just one avatar and some programmed tracks. In fact, if other DJs (Steve Aoki, Tiesto, Deadmau5) don’t jump on this bandwagon, they’re missing out. The virtual world is perfect for EDM types.

Still, you wonder how a singer-songwriter might do under similar circumstances. Say portions of Lady Gaga’s jazz routine she’s currently doing in Las Vegas. Ed Sheeran seems like a natural because much of what he does requires just a guitar. How about a resurrection of MTV’s Unplugged series?

The video game industry is far, far larger than the music industry. Sony, for example, the owner of Fortnite, grossed US$2.4 billion on this one game last year. Meanwhile, its PlayStation division is killing it, too, grossing US$4.9 billion in just one quarter last year. Meanwhile, Sony Music grossed $3.9 billion in all of 2018. Someone is going to figure out how to follow this money.

Could this be the future of music consumption? Don’t bet against it.

Smollett reported two men beat him up, tied a rope around his neck, said racial and homophobic slurs, threw an unidentified chemical substance on him and yelled, “This is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country,” at him in January.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P.

The statement comes following reports that two Chicago Police Department (CPD) sources believed Smollett paid the suspects to help him plan his own attack, according to CNN. The sources said records showed the two brothers purchased the rope found on Smollett’s neck at a Chicago hardware store.

The Nigerian brothers were released Friday after getting arrested for suspicion of assault and battery. (RELATED: Two Men Arrested In Smollett Case Released With No Charges)

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Sunday to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi said previously that media reports claiming the attack was a hoax were “unconfirmed” and the “supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate,” on Twitter Thursday.

One of the “purported suspects” was Smollett’s personal trainer who prepared him for a music video, according to the attorneys’ statement.

One of the suspects worked on “Empire.”

Pugh and Henderson did not immediately respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment.

So, you can see how this took a life of its own. It became a Frankenstein monster within the media, though they missed some red flags.

They’re now cooperating with the investigation after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated battery this week (via Associated Press):

Chicago police say they have released two Nigerian brothers who had been arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assaulting “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, saying that detectives have additional investigative work to complete. The men were picked up by police Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday. They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charges.” Smollett says he was assaulted on Jan. 29 by two men who shouted racial slurs and put a rope around his neck.

Oh, and guess what—those Nigerians bought the rope that was involved in the alleged attack at an ACE Hardware store, though another story is that Smollett himself paid for the rope at a different hardware store. The point is both stories allegedly point to Smollett planning a fake hate crime. Now, Chicago Police sources have told CNN that they feel Smollett orchestrated the attack. The supposed attackers were also allegedly paid over $3,000 each to stage this assault. Oh, and they supposedly held rehearsals for it (via CBS Chicago) [emphasis mine]:

Jussie Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack against him, directed them to buy items used in the alleged assault and actually rehearsed it with them, sources say. Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett. The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.

Jussie Smollett allegedly promised to pay his two pals $4,000 to stage his racist and homophobic assault — which the trio even rehearsed beforehand, according to a new report.

The embattled “Empire” star paid $3,500 to bodybuilding brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo before they left for Nigeria the day of the Jan. 29 attack, and promised another $500 upon their return to the US, sources told CBS Chicago.

Late Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said cops reached out to Smollett’s lawyers to arrange a follow-up interview.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said Guglielmi, who did not elaborate further.

The brothers told cops that the alleged attack in Chicago was supposed to happen before Jan. 29 and that they practiced it in the days before it happened.

Smollett, 36, also allegedly paid for the rope, which was purchased from the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach on Smollett during the 2 a.m. attack, while the other donned a red hat and shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett has claimed his two attackers called him a “f—-t,” “n—-r” and yelled “This is MAGA country!” before throwing a noose around his neck and dousing him in an unknown “chemical substance.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested Wednesday, the same day they returned from Nigeria, and identified as suspects — but then released Friday without charges.

They are cooperating in the investigation and holed up at an undisclosed location.

Cops have said the pair of budding model-actors have a “relationship” with Smollett and worked on his hit TV show on Fox.

Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement late Saturday, saying the actor is “angered and devastated” by claims he staged the attack, according to ABC Chicago.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement said. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter to weigh in on the Smollett controversy.

“It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story,” Trump Jr. wrote.

President Trump previously condemned the alleged hate crime as “horrible.”

On Sunday, media accounts on CNN and Fox News, using unnamed sources, were reporting that police were no longer treating Smollett as a victim and were saying that the evidence they collected implied the attack on Smollett was staged.

Smollett’s attorneys fired back at those reports, Deadline reported.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said defense lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson in a statement.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement said. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett, a gay, black actor who stars in the TV series “Empire,” has said that he was attacked at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he walked on the street near his apartment building. Smollett has said two men shouted racial and homophobic slurs as they struck him and wrapped a rope around his neck yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

The alleged attack provoked harsh condemnation on Twitter from entertainment and political circles.

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 30, 2019

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.

Gloria Schmidt, attorney for Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, spoke to the media Friday night after the brothers — who had been picked up by Wednesday and were reported as possible suspects in the case — were released by police. A video of her comments was posted to the site TMZ.

Asked if that attack was staged, Schmidt said, “There’s so many moving parts to this. That will come out, I think, in due time. I don’t want to speculate.”

Later, talking to reporters, she tried to make her clients’ position clear.

“My guys are walking home. They are not charged. They are not suspects in this case,” she said.

Schmidt added, “there’s still a lot of moving parts to this. … I’m not part of Jussie’s defense. I’m not part of what’s going on with him. I can just tell you that my guys (are) innocent of the charge and they’re going home.”

Meanwhile, the Chicago police confirmed that the “trajectory” of the investigation had changed.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Asked about the evidence, Schmidt said, “Obviously, I had it. Obviously, my clients had it. But I think it took a matter of coordination.” She would not elaborate.

Police said that the two men were the men seen on surveillance videos of the night of the attack.

“Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video,” Chicago police said, WLS reported. “The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”

On Thursday, Smollett was interviewed about the alleged attack on “Good Morning America.” He said the men in the surveillance video had to have been his attackers.

“’Cause … I was there,” he said. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Woods said in the tweet,

“Please join me in using proper grammar, syntax, and spelling. The correct pronoun usage in the English language is “he” for a singular male and ‘she’ for a singular female. ‘They’ is used for the plural of either males, females, or both. Don’t be bullied by hare-brained liberals.”

Other Twitter users wasted no time correcting him, but the best came from Dictionary.com…

“They has been in use as a singular pronoun since the 1300s.”

Dictionary.com also made note that Chaucer, Shakespeare and Jane Austen used “they” as a singular pronoun.

Woods’s slam was of course directed toward transgender and non-binary people, among whom “they” has become a popular pronoun because of its of gender non-specificity.

Woods has also appeared to endorse conspiracy theories surrounding the attack of actor Jussie Smollett, insinuating that the actor faked the violent assault for publicity. Comedian Dave Chapelle did a whole routine about it. (The jury is still out on that one… and public opinion is all over the map.)

I’ve mostly steered clear of this confusing tale except for some of the usual banter on Twitter, but the most recent developments seem to be sending the actor toward a very dark place. To be clear, we’re not at the point where anything is 100% confirmed, and if Smollett actually was attacked I want his assailants found and prosecuted. But according to the Chicago police, the investigation into his alleged assault has “shifted.” They’re still not being terribly specific, but there are plenty of hints to be found as to what they’re talking about. (Associated Press)

Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again. Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack. “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

The cops sounded pretty confident that they had identified the two men seen in various bits of video footage from the time of the supposed assault. The two Nigerians were later identified as being associates of Smollett, with one of them being a personal trainer he’d previously hired to help get him in shape for an acting role. They also don’t seem to fit the profile one might expect of typical “rednecks” in MAGA hats, to put it mildly.

For his part, the actor is still saying there’s “no truth” to the idea he might have played role in the attack, and he finds the suggestion offensive. And of course, he’s blaming Trump, as Karen pointed out yesterday. But details are leaking out and it’s now being alleged that not only did he put his buddies up to participating in a hoax hate crime, but he paid them thousands of dollars to do it. (NY Post)

Chicago police now believe “Empire” TV actor Jussie Smollett paid two pals to fake the attack that he has insisted was carried out by a pair of homophobic and racist strangers, according to a stunning new report. The buddies — body-builder brothers from Nigeria — told cops they purchased the rope for the noose recovered from Smollett’s neck ­after the attack, Fox’s Chicago affiliate reported Saturday night, citing multiple Chicago law-enforcement sources. The two are cooperating with the probe, and have turned over to cops the Ace Hardware receipt for their purchase of the rope, Fox 32 reported.

Coming up with a receipt for the rope used to make the noose sounds like a pretty specific piece of information. Unless some new, startling evidence to the contrary turns up, it’s really looking as if Smollett faked the attack for reasons we don’t yet know.

So let’s say that’s what actually happened. If so, what becomes of this entire debacle? Smollett’s supporters in both Hollywood and the political circus should walk back all the accusations they hurled and their indignant statements of support for him, though most will likely go into radio silence mode on the subject.

But there’s more damage to clean up than the usual Twitter wars. The police invested resources into a lengthy investigation. And the actor has cast a shadow over not only his own career but the future success of the show he’s on. Who pays for all of that? Under Illinois law, filing a false police report in this fashion is just a Class A misdemeanor under the state’s disorderly conduct statutes. For a first offense, it brings a maximum fine of $10,000 and some community service, but jail time is unusual. Does that seem like sufficient justice for setting off a national media firestorm in this fashion?

I’m seeing some people suggest that the supposed death threat letter he received could be treated as a federal crime with more serious penalties. Sending death threats through the U.S. mail system is definitely a crime, but if he either sent it himself or had his friends do it, and all parties knew that it was a hoax, was there really a death threat sent? Seems to me that a competent attorney could get that charged kicked fairly easily.

He didn’t really defame anyone if the two alleged participants not only went along with it but were paid for their services. Making a generic accusation against “Trump-supporting rednecks” may be proven to be a total fabrication, but no specific person would be able to show damages. So is that it? He writes a check to the courts, maybe spends a couple of weekends picking up trash in a public park and everyone just gets on with their lives? That’s what it looks like to me, but it certainly doesn’t feel like a satisfying conclusion."

A disturbing new twist in the Jussie Smollett story arrived on Saturday, when CNN reported two sources inside Chicago law enforcement claiming the Empire actor had played a role in his alleged assault. Now Smollett’s lawyers are denying the allegations, saying, “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The statement, written by defense lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, was obtained by Deadline. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.”

It also reveals that one of the alleged perpetrators is Smollett’s personal trainer. Among the new allegations leaked to the press is that the two men who assaulted the actor, while shouting racial and homophobic epithets, may have been brothers hired to attack him. Another claim is that the men purchased the noose from a local hardware store that was found around his neck when police arrived to investigate the alleged incident.

Late Saturday, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told reporters that “we can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” Guglielmi added, “we’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

More questions surrounding Jussie Smollett and that alleged attack last month have surfaced.

As previously reported Chicago police arrested Nigerian brothers Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo in connection with the crime. The men admitted through their attorney that they know Jussie but denied being involved in the attack.

Now according to CNN, the men are cooperating with police and there’s new evidence that’s NOT painting Smollett in a positive light. Law enforcement sources told CNN that there’s “new evidence” that suggests that Smollett orchestrated the attack himself.

The sources told CNN there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Jussie is apparently pissed about rumors that he’d fabricate an entire hate crime and he’s speaking via his attorneys Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson.

The duo issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying;

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Y I K E S. So do Jussie and his attorneys think the real attackers are still at large???

Fans are pointing out that police, the Chicago ones, in particular, aren’t the most trustworthy so they’re holding out hope that the entire thing wasn’t a hoax.

We’re waiting with bated breath for some clarity on this entire situation—this is all so confusing."

Those Democrats included Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and Reps. Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others.

Waters blamed the attack on President Donald Trump and asked, “Why all of a sudden do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have picnic while black, and being attacked?”

Pelosi tweeted, “The racist, homophobic attack on [Smollett] is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.”

Kamala Harris tweeted that the attack was a “modern-day lynching,” while her fellow senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker used the same term to describe the alleged attack.

Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the attack was not “possibly” a racist and homophobic attack, but that “it was a racist and homophobic attack.”

Smollett, who is gay, claimed that his attacker shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him. However, additional details later added a cloud of doubt to Smollett’s story, including the fact that Smollett was later seen walking to his house in the early hours of the morning with a subway sandwich in his hand.

On Thursday, reports emerged that the Chicago Police Department now believe that the incident was a hoax and that Smollett staged the attack to garner sympathy because his character was being written off the show “Empire,” a report which 20th Century Fox denied, calling the claims “patently ridiculous.”

Two Nigerian brothers were arrested in connection with the case, and on Saturday CNN reported that the brothers are “now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

Chicago police now believe that Smollett paid the two brothers to stage the assault.

Chicago (CNN) Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Smollett denies playing a role in his attack, according to a statement from his attorneys.

The men, who are brothers, were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.”

The sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him."

What did the lawyers say?

They said in a statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.



One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.



Jussie and his attorney's anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At present time, Jussie and his attorney's have no inclination to respond to '""unnamed"" sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.

What are the details?

After weeks of intense investigative work, the case took a turn last Wednesday when Chicago police apprehended two Nigerian brothers who worked as extras in the same TV show that Smollett stars in. Those brothers — Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola Osundairo, 25 — were released Friday night when new evidence surfaced, shifting the trajectory of the investigation.

Reports now indicate that the brothers, who are fully cooperating with detectives, admitted Smollett hired them to orchestrate the attack. The admission reportedly came after investigators confronted them with evidence proving they bought the rope found around Smollett's neck after the attack.

According to WBBM-TV, not only did the Osundairo brothers purchase the rope at Smollett's request, but Smollett also paid for it. The brothers were allegedly paid $3,500 each for the hoax attack before leaving for Nigeria later on the afternoon of Jan. 29, the same day Smollett says he was attacked.

The brothers were reportedly promised another $500 each upon their return to the U.S.

More from WBBM-TV:

Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.



The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.



Meanwhile, Fox News' Mike Tobin reported Saturday, citing a Chicago Police spokesman, that Smollett is no longer considered a ""victim"" in the case. That's a dramatic shift after police, upon releasing the Osundairo brothers without charges late Friday, maintained that Smollett is a victim."

Smollet also hired a top-level legal team known for high-profile criminal and civil cases located in Chicago.

On Feb. 16, 2019, news agencies began reporting that Smollett orchestrated his own hate crime. CNN confirmed they had their own sources which verified Smollett’s story was false.

Smollett’s new attorneys, Victor P. Henderson, and Todd S. Pugh submitted to Forbes on Feb. 16 a statement stating their client continues to be victimized by the claims he was a participant in his own attack. The continued by saying it is not true and anyone who says anything otherwise is lying.

Smollet appeared on Good Morning America with host Robin Roberts to discuss the alleged attack. In the interview, he told Roberts he never stated his attackers wore “MAGA” hats.

On Feb. 13, two Nigerian brothers who worked with Smollett as extras on “Empire” were arrested. They were released from custody on Feb. 15. At the time, police informed the press that these two individuals were known by Smollett. Police continued to report that the case was still considered a hate crime wherein two white men who were wearing ski masks attacked the actor, placed a rope around his neck shouting “MAGA country,” poured a chemical substance on him, and spewed homophobic and racist slurs.

Multiple news organizations reported Smollett hired Michael Cohen’s criminal justice attorney Michael Monico. Monico told the “The Roe Conn Show” on Feb. 14 he was hired to represent Smollett. Forbes magazine spoke with Smollett’s team on Feb. 16, who informed them Monico was not representing the “Empire” actor.

On Friday, police released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement on Saturday, which said: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Lawyers for Smollett later issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimised” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson said.

Smollett has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country!”.

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on January 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up two brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late on Friday, police said they were no longer suspects.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from the actor’s lawyers said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement added.

Police said they combed surveillance video but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

“The giddiness among Trumpsters over the Smollett news is gross. This story is awful. He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics,” CNN host S.E. Cupp tweeted.

CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, the author of the network’s “Reliable Sources” newsletter, retweeted her in agreement shortly thereafter. Look:

“This is sad no matter your politics.” https://t.co/DuqLVATWrb — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 17, 2019

Never mind that thanks to what now appear to be Smollett’s lies — not to mention the media’s rush to report these lies without performing even the slightest due diligence — half the country thinks Trump supporters are a bunch of racist, homophobic monsters.

Smollett claimed in late January that two men had assaulted him, poured bleach on him and placed a noose around his neck, all while allegedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs and shouting, “This is MAGA country!” FYI, Chicago hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931.

According to TMZ, Smollett also claimed that the suspect was white. The dubious description of the alleged attack provided to local authorities by him led the left to assume the perpetrators were racist white supporters of President Donald Trump and that Trump was therefore to blame.

“This is what happens,” actress Ellen Page said on “The Late Show” earlier this month, referencing the attack. “If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them — you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is gonna happen? … This needs to f–king stop.”

Yet this false narrative began to crumble like a day-old muffin last week when authorities in Chicago raided the homes of and arrested two Nigeran brothers, actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, on suspicion of orchestrating a fake hate crime.

While the two were released Friday, local authorities are now reportedly requesting a follow-up interview. Moreover, law enforcement sources have confirmed with the media that the Chicago Police Department are now fairly certain Smollett paid the men to orchestrate a fake assault on him.

CNN: Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault.

HERE’S WHAT YOU’RE MISSING …

Now ask yourself a question: How would you feel if someone tried to smear you by accusing you of committing a hate crime against him? How would you then feel if he was finally outed as a liar who had concocted the hate crime out of thin air? Perhaps you’d feel relieved, even giddy?

You’d very likely also feel anger at the perp for having smeared you. Except according to CNN, the perp’s disgusting attempt to smear you doesn’t deserve anger. No. YOU deserve anger and condemnation because YOU have the audacity to feel relieved that the man who smeared you has been exposed.

#ThisIsCNN …

Perhaps Cupp and Stelter should spend some time reading the enraged, top-voted replies to their absurd, sanctimonious tweets today, because they may yet learn something.

…

Look:

What America should be doing is giving the media it’s anger in full . Smollett is a tool you used to look down, pass judgement and divide this country. Don’t try to pivot out of this SE. What media did was just as bad as the crime, hoax or not. — IrritatedWoman™ (@irritatedwoman) February 17, 2019

Again. And they learned nothing since doing it to the Covington teens a few weeks prior. Except they hired Tom Hanks to lecture us all in a $5M dollar ad in the middle of the Super Bowl. Can’t imagine why we’d be giddy. — The Smirking Hillbilly (@LauraLMonroe33) February 17, 2019

Gross is watching usually decent people willingly accept this farcical take and run with it.

Gross is watching ABC, Robin Roberts, and every Dem Presidential candidate hold this lying dolt up like some victim.

Gross is smearing political rivals as criminals. — Daniel (@Sinclair_D_F) February 17, 2019

Sad is the amount of coverage the truth won’t get.

Sad is thinking that educated people believed this fairy tale.

Sad is the lack of accountability for those who pushed this drivel. — Daniel (@Sinclair_D_F) February 17, 2019

The only tweet where @secupp admits that “He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report” is in a tweet ripping Trumpers for being giddy at media. Well your tweets explains the giddiness — Yossi Gestetner (@YossiGestetner) February 17, 2019

What is gross is accepting that anyone who voted for Trump is a de facto racist and so using that worldview to believe every obviously outrageous tall tale because it confirms your bias. The people hurt most by this are real victims. Smollett is disgusting as is the media. — Melissa Mackenzie ? (@MelissaTweets) February 17, 2019

Correction. I believe you meant “The giddiness among ANTI-Trumpsters over the Smollett news WAS gross.” — Joe Timmerman (@JoeTFinance) February 17, 2019

The latter user nailed it. Every time a Trump supporter commits an alleged offense of some type, the entire left — including the media — wield the alleged (and more often than not later debunked) as a cudgel against “Trump’s America” and his purportedly mean, evil supporters.

“To many, the Smollett incident — and the political nature of the assault — is yet another reminder for many black gay Americans that this president’s vision of a “great America” does not appear to include them,” The Washington Post excitedly wrote after Smollett claimed to be attacked last month.

Except as usual, the vision of a racist America touted almost daily by the disingenuous, politically driven media has turned out to be a total lie. And it’s no surprise given how many red flags Smollett’s tale contained, as noted by former TV news host Megyn Kelly:

J. Smollett case had plenty of red flags, but media was too attached to storyline (& victimhood) to see/admit them. Once again, journos dedicated more to proving *themselves* virtuous than to reporting facts botch the story. It’s tiresome & won’t change. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) February 17, 2019

Red flags that the media conveniently chose to ignore, of course.

Yesterday Chicago police said their investigation of the attack had “shifted,” having previously dismissed earlier suggestions that the attack had been staged.

To recap: Smollett, one of the stars of FOX’s hit show Empire, which shoots in Chicago, told police he was attacked January 29th by two men who had assaulted him and tried to tie a rope around his neck. They also spilled a liquid on him that was widely referred to as bleach in the media. This was all while they simultaneously hurled racial slurs and shouted this is MAGA country.

Two Nigerian brothers who are extras on the show (see them below with Empire creator Lee Daniels) appear to be the two men spotted in a surveillance video near the scene of the crime.

“The Nigerians said they had bought the rope used in the attack at a nearby hardware store,” a source told CNN after thee two brothers were released from custody Friday.

Smollet’s attorneys issued a statement to CNN Saturday saying: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

Attorneys for the actor and singer Jussie Smollett have said there is no truth to reports that he played a role in orchestrating an alleged assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

Jussie Smollett says he was assaulted because of his criticisms of Trump Read more

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers said: “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The lawyers said Smollett, who stars in the TV drama Empire, would continue to cooperate with police.

Earlier on Saturday, Chicago police said their investigation of the attack had “shifted” following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released on Friday without being charged.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men was the actor’s personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and homophobic slurs and a Trump slogan: “This is MAGA country!”

On Thursday, in his first detailed interview since the alleged 29 January assault, Smollett was asked by ABC’s Good Morning America why he thinks he was targeted. In his reply, he referred to Donald Trump by his moniker as the 45th president.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” he said. “I come really, really hard against his administration and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Smollett was played a clip of Trump responding to news of the alleged attack. The president said: “I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I’m concerned.”

The actor said he appreciated Trumps words, but added that he had no doubt that his assailants were motivated by his criticism of the president.

With ABC censoring the comment on taste grounds, Smollett said: “I can only go off of their words. Who says, ‘[bleep] Empire, this Maga country,’ [bleep] ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on to you? And this is just a friendly fight?”

Smollett told police the men looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on 29 January. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the alleged attack.

On Sunday the Democratic presidential contender Cory Booker, who called the alleged attack on Smollett a “modern-day lynching” after the actor reported it, said he was now withholding judgment.

After meeting hundreds of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, the New Jersey senator said he would reserve judgment “until all the information actually comes out from on-the-record sources”.

Turning his focus back to combating hate crimes broadly, Booker called for a unified pushback against “attacks on people because they’re different”."

Now, TMZ reports that a grand jury has been assembled to decide whether the Empire actor orchestrated his own attack.

According to the website, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo – the two Nigerian brothers and reported Empire extras who said they conspired with Smollett to carry out the attack – are set to testify before a grand jury.

Last month, Smollett alleged that he was attacked in a shocking racist and homophobic assault, with police later confirming that the incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime on January 29.

The Osundairo brothers were released without charge on Saturday (February 16). Chicago Police Department’s Chief Communications Officer, Anthony Guglielmi, revealed that “new evidence” had been found in relation to the incident.

Gugliemi tweeted: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

It was revealed that police were seeking to interview Smollett again and that the investigation had “shifted” focus based on new “information received.”

An additional statement from Gugliemi read: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

CBS reported claims that the Osundairo brothers were paid $3500 to help stage the attack before leaving for Nigeria, with both promised an additional $500 on their return.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, released a statement about the allegations of staging.

The statement read: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

Smollett gained fame for his portrayal of musician Jamal Lyon on Empire, which began in 2015. Earlier this week, writers of Empire released a statement denying Smollett was being written out of the show."

Hollywood actor Jussie Smollett is facing further questioning by police after he claimed he had been a victim of a homophobic and racist attack.

The actor said he was physically abused by two men wearing pro-Donald Trump hats and shouting racial and anti-gay slurs.

Chicago Police is now stating it wants to speak to him again after the “trajectory of the investigation” shifted.

The i newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.

But what happened to Smollett and why are the police now questioning claims about the attack? Here’s what we know.

Who is Jussie Smollett?

Jussie Smollett is an American actor who started his career in the kids’ film The Mighty Ducks and various TV adverts.

He shot to fame after landing the role of musician Jamal Lyon in the award-winning Fox drama series Empire, and also starred as Ricks in Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant, the sequel to Prometheus.

He came out as gay in 2015.

Why has he become the focus of a police investigation?

In January 2019, Smollett, 36, said he was attacked outside his apartment in Chicago as he returned from getting food at a nearby Subway restaurant at 2am.

He claimed two masked men in ski masks used racial and anti-gay slurs and shouted “This is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country!”.

According to the claims, the men looped a rope around his neck before running away. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him but he fought them off and was admitted to hospital and discharged a few hours later.

Public figures, including celebrities and Democrat politicians, expressed public support for Smollett on social media.

Smollett also told police he was on the phone to his manager Brandon Z. Moore at the time of the attack, with Moore confirming he heard some of what happened including the MAGA cry and a racist slur.

What happened after the attack?

Chicago Police released CCTV footage of two individuals walking down a street who they said were wanted for questioning.

However, police said they combed surveillance video but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Police earlier this week said there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect”.

Celebrities including Katy Perry, John Legend and Viola Davis spoke out on Twitter in support of the artist.

Have any arrests been made?

On Wednesday 13 February , Chicago police picked up two brothers of Nigerian descent at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

The following day, Chicago Police dismissed claims that the actor had been in on the assault and said reports he was involved were “unconfirmed”.

But late on Friday 15 February, the two men were released without charge as police said they were no longer suspects.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Chicago Police then told ABC News: “Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack – or whether the attack happened at all.”

Who are the two men arrested?

The men have been extras on Empire and know Smollett from working on the show. According to a statement from Smollett’s lawyer, one is his personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video.

The statement added: “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

What has Smollett said about the incident?

Apart from his report to police, the actor told ABC News that he at first hesitated to call police because “we live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak”.

He then did an emotional interview with Good Morning America during which he broke down in tears as he shared details of the attack and told host Robin Roberts he was “pissed off” that people were doubting him.

He said: “It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks. You know, at first it was a thing of, if I tell the truth, that’s it, because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of like, oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth.

“And then it became a thing of, oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.”

He added: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Why are questions being raised over his allegation?

Doubts began to form when Smollett initially refused to give police his mobile phone because the device contained private content and phone numbers.

Some even began to question Smollett’s claim and wonder if he had concocted the entire story with many taking to social media to share their doubts.

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Law firm Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson said Smollett would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimised” by reports he might have been involved in the attack.

I filed this column late — about 20 years late.

My brother, a Los Angeles-based marketing specialist who came out as gay two decades ago, often urges me to write more about the LGBTQ community. I’m missing a big story, he says.

But, I tell him, I need a news peg. Now, suddenly, I have my pick.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the uprising in New York’s Greenwich Village in June 1969 credited with sparking the gay and lesbian civil rights movement.

It also seems we’re living through an LGBTQ moment.

— Last week, Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” addressed doubts about his claim that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. Smollett says that two men yelled slurs, hit him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck while shouting, “This is MAGA country!” In an emotional interview Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” the actor called “ridiculous” the idea that he would lie about such a thing, as some have alleged. Smollett told co-anchor Robin Roberts: “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.”

— A few days after the alleged assault on Smollett, during an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” actress Ellen Page launched her own attack. Page, who is married to a woman, took aim at Vice President Mike Pence. Page said Pence tried to ban same-sex marriage when he was Indiana governor, and said the vice president believes in conversion therapy. She accused Pence of “hating” LGBTQ people and wanting “to cause suffering.” She blamed the vice president for the alleged attack on Smollett and other assaults against LGBTQ folks. “This needs to f—— stop!” Page said to rousing applause.

— Then Page slammed actor Chris Pratt after the star of “Guardians of the Galaxy” — during an appearance of his own on Colbert’s show — discussed his church. In a tweet, Page called Pratt’s house of faith — Hillsong Church — “infamously anti-LGBTQ.” According to Variety, in 2015, church executives drew criticism for calling homosexuality a sin. Pratt rejected Page’s accusation and fired back with a post on Instagram, saying that “nothing could be further from the truth.” His church, he claims, “opens their doors to absolutely everyone … regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender.”

— In Texas, a gay couple was brutally beaten on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime committed by four men who have since been arrested. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were holding hands as they left a gay club in downtown Austin when they heard a man shout a homophobic slur. More obscenities followed, as the man motioned for the others to join him. One of the men punched Perry to the ground, and Deehring was also attacked when he tried to defend Perry, according to the report. With both men on the ground, the cowards allegedly punched and kicked them until they were unconscious. Deehring suffered cuts and a minor concussion while Perry had a major concussion, internal bleeding and a broken nose.

— Finally, just this past week, in San Diego, in what authorities are calling a hate crime, a gunman opened fire in the Hillcrest neighborhood, which is considered the epicenter of the city’s LGBTQ community. Armed with a high-powered AR-15 rifle, Stefano Parker allegedly shot 19 rounds through the window of restaurant after posting an anti-LGBTQ comment on Facebook. There were nine people in the establishment, but no one was hurt. Parker was charged with nine counts of attempted murder.

Just curious. What decade is this? I’m asking for friends and family.

The conventional thinking is that — with millions of dollars in AIDS funding, the Supreme Court having struck down laws banning gay marriage, and scores of LGBTQ characters and storylines on film and television — all the battles have been fought and won.

Not even close. Members of that community say they fear a rollback of hard-earned rights, privileges and protections, and that they’ll force the issue in the 2020 presidential election. This is the conversation America needs to have.

In the 1990s, the mealy-mouthed compromise was: “Don’t ask, don’t tell.” Today, in many families, it’s more like: “Don’t talk, don’t share.”

Our fellow Americans are hurting. They’re marginalized, threatened and beaten. Then they’re told there is something wrong with them.

This has to stop!

In fact, all the evidence suggests that Smollett hired actors to stage the fake crime to promote an anti-Trump narrative ― which the media gleefully lapped up.

Evidence suggests that Smollett ― whose Twitter feed is filled with anti-Trump hatred dating back to 2011 ― paid $3,500 to two Nigerian brothers to stage a hoax attack, which he blamed on white Trump supporters.

Chicago police released the following statement on Feb. 16:

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Nigerian Brothers Bought 2 Red Hats

A police investigation shows that the two Nigerian brothers worked as extras on Smollett’s TV series “Empire.” The brothers’ names are Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo.

Records also show that they bought the rope that was found around Smollett’s neck from a Chicago hardware store on January 25 ― four days before the alleged attack.

Police sources noted that the Nigerian brothers also purchased two plain red hats (resembling MAGA hats) at a local Chicago beauty supply store.

The Osundairo brothers told authorities that Smollett paid them $3,500 before they left for Nigeria (hours after the bogus attack on January 29) and were promised an additional $500 upon their return, CBS Chicago reported.

No Chicagoan Would Yell: ‘This Is MAGA Country!’

As BizPac Review reported, Jussie Smollett’s unbelievable story started to fall apart immediately, as the “facts” he presented did not appear credible from the jump.

Smollett claimed that on January 29, he was approached by two men who “yelled out racial and homophobic slurs” while attacking him. Specifically, Smollett claimed his imaginary assailants yelled: ‘Empire f**got! and ‘Empire n****.”

Smollett further claimed that one of the attackers tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Keep in mind that Smollett claimed this attack happened in Chicago ― a liberal city which has not had a Republican mayor since 1931. The idea that anyone would consider Chicago “MAGA Country” was the first laughably suspicious “factoid” that drew skepticism from Trump supporters.

Another odd claim Smollett made was that the imaginary Trump supporters who attacked him identified him as an actor from the hip-hop TV show “Empire.” The statistical odds that any Trump supporter actually knew who Jussie Smollett was (or were fans of “Empire”) are comically minuscule.

Jussie Smollett was an obscure actor who starred on the hip-hop TV show “Empire” from 2015 until February 2019.

Even though Smollett tried to gain public sympathy by playing the victim, he led a very privileged life — earning $125,000 an episode on his hit TV show.

Smollett Denies He Staged Crime, Despite Evidence

Through his attorney, Smollett denied that he paid the two Nigerian brothers to stage a fake hate crime, and insisted that he is still a victim:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Media and ‘Celebrities’ Rushed to Judgment

Predictably, countless celebrities and politicians issued statements condemning the fake “racist and homophobic” attack on Smollett in their bids to smear these hateful imaginary Trump supporters.

Actor Jussie Smollett has denied reports suggesting that he played a role in his own attack. Attorneys for the Empire actor on Saturday issued a statement saying Smollett is “devastated” with the recent developments in his case, reports variety.com.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” said the lawyers, Victor P Henderson and Todd S Pugh. They said Smollett is “the victim of a hate crime” and will continue to cooperate with investigators.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” lawyers added. Earlier this week, media reports here said Smollett, who was allegedly attacked by several men last month, had himself planned the attack.

Following the reports, Chicago Police started investigating and found the reports “unconfirmed by case detectives”."

THE FULL STATEMENT FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S ATTORNEYS

Lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson issued the following statement on Jussie's behalf on Saturday night: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. 'One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. 'Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels. During the attack, the assailants yelled 'Empire f****t' and 'Empire n*****,' the actor has long maintained. That narrative, however, is now under serious scrutiny by investigators, who reportedly have evidence that Smollett directed his 'attackers' to buy the rope used in the 'assault' at a local hardware store. Documents prove two Nigerian brothers who work as extras on the highly rated Fox drama bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Chicago. The brothers made the purchase on the weekend of January 25. They also bought two red plain hats that they wore during the alleged attack, according to sources close to the investigation. Police believe that the red hats were purchased at a local beauty supply store in the Uptown section of Chicago. 'We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,' Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said. 'We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.' Chicago police are now ‘eager to speak to Jussie Smollett’ in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News. ‘We have been in touch with Smollett's attorneys,’ a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE Here is what we know so far about the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett and the ongoing investigation by the Chicago Police Department. Since CPD is not commenting citing the ongoing probe, the public has been left to rely on Smollett’s version of events. On January 29, Smollett was allegedly assaulted by two men at around 2am. Reports indicated that he was allegedly beaten up and had a noose tied around his neck. The alleged assault took place as Smollett was on his way home after buying a sandwich at a local Subway. Initial reports indicated that the attackers were ‘white men’ who yelled ‘This is MAGA country’ while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and pouring bleach on him. But during an interview with Robin Roberts of ABC’s Good Morning America, Smollett denied that his assailants wore red MAGA hats. Smollett also told Roberts that contrary to reports, his ribs were not broken as a result of the incident. After the assault, some began to wonder if Smollett concocted the entire story. That there were those who doubted Smollett stems from a number of factors. A Chicago Police spokesperson said on the day after the alleged attack that investigators were unable to find evidence of an assault. The only surveillance camera at the scene was pointed in the opposite direction. Smollett also phoned the police from his apartment rather than from the scene. When Smollett initially refused investigators’ request to hand over his phone, this raised eyebrows. Smollett then handed over his phone records, but they were redacted in order to protect the privacy of people not involved in the attack. On Friday, police arrested two Nigerian men in the connection with the attack - only to have them released later. Since both men are black, this has led some to be suspicious of Smollett’s claim that this was a hate crime. Information emerged later on showing that Smollett knew the two men who were arrested since they were extras on Empire. A theory floating around on social media stated that Smollett staged the attack because his character was being written off Empire. But the show’s producers and writers quickly refuted that claim.

‘We made our intentions clear,’ he said.

Brothers Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo, 25, were cut loose from police custody late on Friday. They had been held since Wednesday, after being picked up at O'Hare Airport while disembarking a flight from Nigeria.

The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised another $500 upon returning, according to WBBM-TV.

Earlier on Saturday, Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Attorney Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, revealed in a radio interview on Thursday in Chicago that he is representing Smollett.

Monico, speaking on WGN's The Roe Conn Show, did not reveal how long he has been representing Smollet or in what capacity. Monico last month took over as co-counsel for Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer.

It came as police in Chicago suddenly released the two Nigerian extras on Smollett's show, who had previously been described as suspects in the attack, saying that 'new evidence' had emerged in their interrogations that requires further detective work.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT COULD GET 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FILING A FALSE REPORT TO POLICE

Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony.

That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison.

By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who 'transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed,

Last week, a central Illinois man was sentenced to three years in state prison after he pleaded guilty to fabricating an Amber alert.

On December 15, Mitchell Dutz, 18, told police that three black men stole his car with a 13-month-old infant inside.

Dutz used a social media photo of a child he did not know to claim that there was a kidnapping, according to Peoria Journal Star.

But police rescinded the Amber alert after it became clear that it was a hoax.

Dutz pleaded guilty to motor-vehicle burglary and disorderly conduct.

Last month, a Chicago woman was charged with a felony after she allegedly made a 911 call that turned out to be a

'swatting' incident.

Keesha S. Ingram, 41, allegedly called police before dawn on December 11 to report that a man was threatening to shoot his wife in their home in Warren Township.

Sheriff's deputies responded to the call. They arrived at the scene and set up a perimeter around the house.

After making contact with the residents inside, the deputies determined there was no incident to warrant an arrest, according to the Daily Herald.

Authorities then determined that they were dealing with a 'swatting' incident whereby a person falsely reports an ongoing crime at a particular address in order to harass the individual who lives there.

An investigation led back to Ingram, who is alleged to have known one of the people who lived in the Warren Township home.

Investigators believe Ingram made the swatting call out of revenge against the victim, whom she accused of not paying her money that was owed to her.

Ingram is still on the loose and is wanted for arrest, according to Patch

'Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,' Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday night.

The Osundairo brothers' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, spoke briefly to reporters after their release, hinting that Smollett's legal future could hold difficulties.

'There's so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,' Schmidt said when asked if her clients had helped Smollett stage the attack. 'I'm going to let them tell their story when the time is right.'

Smollett made international headlines after reporting the attack on January 29, in which he said two men assaulted him at 2am on a Chicago street, shouting vile racist and homophobic slurs.

The actor said that he fought back bravely as the two men shouted 'this is MAGA country,' poured bleach on him, and looped a noose around his neck.

Smollett has vigorously denied speculation that details of the attack were fabricated or staged, speaking out in an interview that aired on Wednesday just hours before the Osundairo brothers were detained.

It is unclear at this time what the Osundairo brothers told police that would alter the course of the investigation.

'The left is mentally insane': Trump supporters say they are vindicated since 'Jussie is a liar and a fraud'

As Jussie Smollett is now suspected by authorities of fabricating claims he was beaten by two men alleged to have been Trump supporters, the president’s backers said on Saturday that they are vindicated. The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted: ‘It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.’ Journalist Michael Tracey tweeted: ‘Popular culture and political media have been so relentless in their promotion of alarmist Trump-era narratives that all critical faculties go out the window when it comes to ""hate"" incidents that align suspiciously closely with everything pundits, celebs, etc. want to believe.’ Brian Flood tweeted: ‘CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news... but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters.’ ‘There was never any real attack,’ according to Ryan Fournier.

Brian Flood tweeted: ‘CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news... but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters'

Andrew Surabian tweeted: ‘And just like with Covington, the media was all too willing to help Jussie Smollett pull off his hoax and in the process frame Trump supporters in the court of public opinion before any actual facts came out’

‘Jussie paid to be attacked and then made it look like Trump supporters did it.

‘This is how mentally insane the left has become. They will do anything to bring us down.

‘Well it’s not happening because Jussie is going to jail.’

Fournier also tweeted: ‘Jussie Smollett is a liar and a fraud.

‘He needs to be punished for faking an assault and framing Trump supporters.’

Others compared the Smollett case to last month’s controversy surrounding the teens from Covington, Kentucky, who were filmed making faces at a Native American protester in front of the Lincoln Memorial.

A number of teens from a Catholic high school wore red ‘Make America Great Again’ hats.

Andrew Surabian tweeted: ‘And just like with Covington, the media was all too willing to help Jussie Smollett pull off his hoax and in the process frame Trump supporters in the court of public opinion before any actual facts came out.’

Late on Friday, police sources said that cops had seized a bottle of bleach from Smollett's apartment, according to Fox News correspondent Matt Finn.

Meanwhile, new information surfaced about the Osundairo brothers, who in the course of 48 hours went from 'potential persons of interest' to 'potential suspects' to being under arrest because investigators had 'probable cause that they were involved in a crime' to being set free.

Since their release on Friday night, they have been staying at an undisclosed location.

Police said that the brothers were the two men who were seen on a surveillance image released to the public, and Smollett positively identified the two men in the image as his attackers in a televised interview.

The two brothers are both strongly opposed to President Donald Trump and fervently pro-LGBT, fellow Empire cast and crew members tell TMZ. Both men are said to be loyal fans of former President Barack Obama.

Smollett is said to be close with the brothers and would frequently approach them on set to discuss health and fitness.

Colleagues on the tight-knit Empire set said they had a hard time imagining that the Osundairo brothers could have been involved in the kind of homophobic and bigoted attack that Smollett described.

Police initially said that they tied the brothers to the reported attack using meticulous investigative efforts, including surveillance videos and information from ride-sharing companies.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett's luxury apartment block.

The brothers left Chicago for Nigeria hours after the attack.

(Jim Young/Reuters)

What if these are not extraordinary times -- or, at least, not extraordinary in the way our activists and media entrepreneurs would have us believe?

Jussie Smollett’s story has always sounded a little . . . extraordinary.

Smollett, who appears on the television series Empire, says he was attacked on the streets of Chicago at 2 a.m. by two men who shouted racial and homophobic abuses at him, beat him, doused him with bleach, and fastened a noose around his neck, exclaiming, “This is MAGA country!” a reference to President Donald Trump’s political slogan.

That story assumes two possible extraordinary backstories: One, that these two MAGAmen were stalking Smollett and bided their time until they could nab him at 2 a.m. on his way home from getting a snack at Subway, executing their lightning strike with practically Swiss precision, over and done in less than a minute while keeping their violence entirely within the lacunae between the surrounding security cameras; or, two, that two criminally violent Trump fans who happened to cruising the streets of the part of Chicago where Smollett lies at 2 a.m. while in possession of a noose and a jug of bleach just happened to notice him — these are Trump fans who are also big Empire fans, apparently — and, recognizing him as a gay black man and outspoken advocate on gay-rights issues, jumped him on a lark, nonetheless executing their lightning strike with practically Swiss precision, over and done in less than a minute while keeping their violence entirely within the lacunae between the surrounding security cameras.

Either of those scenarios certainly would be extraordinary.

Two men were captured on video walking near the scene of the alleged attack at the time it is supposed to have happened, though the attack itself escaped filming. Smollett says he is sure that the men on the video are the ones who attacked him. Police believe those two men are Nigerian nationals and aspiring actors who appeared with Smollett on Empire and sometimes hung around with him at the gym. It is possible that two black immigrants in the entertainment business are Trump partisans so rabid in their admiration that they hunted down one of their black colleagues and abused him in racial terms while assaulting him.

That would be quite extraordinary.

Two relevant facts here are not in dispute: that gay men and members of other minority groups sometimes are targeted for violent crimes by men driven by hatred, and that there has been a years-long epidemic of members of minority groups and allied political activists staging fake hate crimes for their own selfish reasons or to — odious phrase — “raise awareness” about such crimes.

The irony is that the hoaxers have something in common with Mr. MAGA himself: They desire to proclaim a state of emergency.

Emergencies are dangerous things. India was in many ways dysfunctional in the 1970s, but it was a democratic society operating under the rule of law until Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency. The prelude to her declaration will not be entirely unfamiliar to contemporary Americans: The executive (in a parliamentary system embedded in the legislature) arrogated new powers unto itself, unhappy with the limitations imposed on it by the other branches of government, in this case the judiciary. Genuine social problems led to tension and unrest, which were channeled into a dispute involving allegations that the election had been monkeyed with. A court case was opened. Mrs. Gandhi lost that case, and, with it, her seat in the upper house of Parliament; the court further banned her from standing for office for six years. She and her supporters argued that she was being removed from office for a conviction on relatively trivial charges (misuse of state resources for political purposes, offenses for which her guilt was never seriously in doubt) and insisted that her critics were not merely engaged in opposition politics but attempting a coup d’état. A state of emergency was declared, and Mrs. Gandhi’s first use of her new emergency powers was to . . . cut off the electricity to the nation’s newspapers. India’s newspapers are a wonderfully troublesome lot. Mrs. Gandhi considered them agents of the coup.

Everybody has an emergency to peddle. They always appear at the most convenient times and in the most convenient places. President Trump has just suffered a humiliating defeat in his confrontation with Congress about funding for his beloved wall — and losing a political contest, or having a disagreement about spending, is not an emergency. President Trump has been in office since January 2017, and if illegal immigration is an emergency now, it was an emergency then, but he has only now got around to declaring a state of emergency. The variable isn’t the level of illegal immigration — it’s Trump’s getting steamrolled by Nancy Pelosi.

The fake hate crimes tend to crop up in the places where real ones are least likely to happen but where people are most eager to have them happen in order to affirm their own petty hatreds, which means the socially segregated spaces occupied by the social-justice Left, college campuses prominent among them. In November, Goucher College was convulsed by a series of threats against black students and racist graffiti, which turned out to be the work of a hoaxer, Fynn Arthur, a black student and member of the lacrosse team who was charged with a criminal offense in the matter. These things have the feel of inevitability: The closest thing to a genuine hate crime to happen at Goucher College was the school’s decision to admit young Jonah Goldberg as an undergraduate.

Likewise, the “epidemic” of sexual assaults on college campuses is a myth, an urban legend that shows up nowhere in the actual crime statistics, which suggest that college women are in fact less likely to suffer a sexual assault than a member of the general population. (The women most likely to suffer sexual assault are poor, nonwhite, and non-college educated, especially those residing in relatively insular or isolated communities.) Campus feminists invent these stories for reasons of cultural politics, as we have seen over and over: Lena Dunham and “Barry” the College Republican, the Rolling Stone fiction, etc.

Informed by Randolph Bourne’s admonition that “war is the health of the state,” socialists have long used every war — or “moral equivalent of war” — as a pretext for insisting that the state take over the commanding heights of the economy: World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, Paul Ehrlich’s fanciful Malthusian prophecies regarding overpopulation, the 2008-09 financial crisis, the “inequality” panic, and now, under the dotty inspiration of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, global warming — a dozen different maladies, the same proffered therapy in every case.

Extraordinary.

Emergencies offer a moral permission slip. Under normal circumstances, the political leaders of the democratic world would not countenance the indiscriminate bombing of civilian population centers for the purpose of trying to bully a foreign dictator into surrender, but that is exactly what happened under U.S. leadership in World War II. (Necessary evil is no less evil for its being necessary.) President Lincoln did a few things that probably weren’t quite legal. Winston Churchill favored a massacre of German military and government leaders after the war as a prophylactic against Nazi revanchism and had to be pressed into accepting the Nuremberg trials, which he considered a farce. The citizens of the world’s liberal democracies, Americans especially, have an implicit understanding with their covert operatives: Our agents do things that are sometimes illegal or immoral in the pursuit of that which is necessary to physical security, and we pretend not to notice as long as they perform their additional professional duty of preventing us from being forced to notice.

What to do about Adolf Hitler is a different kind of question from what to do about Donald Trump or what to do about the illegal immigrants employed by such firms as Houston-based Waste Management of Texas. But if you can convince yourself that Trump is the moral equivalent of Hitler, that illegal immigration is a sudden existential threat to the republic, that our nation’s allegedly atavistic redneck culture has us on the verge of a Kristallnacht for homosexuals, or that all life on Earth will become extinct if Field Marshal Sandy doesn’t have her way every time she stamps her foot, then you can justify — to others, and to yourself — measures that are extraordinary. Among those extraordinary measures is the lie in the service of “a greater truth.”

But what if these are not extraordinary times — or, at least, not extraordinary in the way our activists and media entrepreneurs would have us believe?

The “greater truth” is this: The United States of America is a relatively peaceful, extraordinarily prosperous, and fundamentally decent society. Americans are greedy and violent, but we also are generous and brave. Our country is home to flat-Earthers and world-changing geniuses, both of them in unusual numbers. It’s a package deal. We have a relatively ineffective and dysfunctional federal government, and we have social differences that have put the two main modes of American life (and the political tendencies related to them) at odds with one another, and that more bitterly than is necessary. Those are real problems.

We’ll sort them out — if we allow the excellent institutions we have painstakingly constructed to do that perform as necessary. These include the separation of powers, the rule of law, due process and the presumption of innocence, models of guilt and entitlement that are individual rather than racial or otherwise corporate, freedom of speech, open discourse and inquiry, adversarial political parties, and — this is almost lost — a meaningful distinction between public and private things. The purpose of emergencies — and, especially, phony emergencies — is to empower partisans and advocates and people with power to overrule those institutions in the pursuit of their own immediate parochial goals, whether those include a wall along the southern border or a mandatory seminar on “rape culture” at Yale. Conservative budget nerds often speak of their desire to see Congress return to “regular order.” But it isn’t just Congress that needs to return to regular order — so do the presidency, and the courts, and the people."

Chicago police want to interview Smollett, after learning new evidence from two Nigerian brothers who were released on Friday night. Local media outlets have reported that the brothers admitted to police that Smollett paid them to carry out the attack. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement earlier Saturday saying that the new evidence “shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Smollett’s attorneys denied that he was involved, saying “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two men had attacked him, poured bleach on him, put a rope around his neck, and used racial and homophobic slurs. Police scoured hundreds of hours of surveillance video in search of clues in the case, eventually tracking down the two brothers on Wednesday night.

In the statement, Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” said the attorneys, Victor P. Henderson and Todd S. Pugh.

The lawyers said that Smollett is “the victim of a hate crime,” and will continue to cooperate with investigators.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the attorneys said.

The full statement:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Almost immediately after suffering from what he told cops was a violent, anti-gay and racist attack, “Empire” star Jussie Smollett insisted on going on TV to tell his story, The Post has learned.

Smollett was quickly “adamant” that he wanted to appear on ABC’s Good Morning America, said one source with knowledge of the GMA booking decision.

His case took a dark turn Saturday night, when Chicago police told Fox that they now believe Smollett paid two pals to fake the crime.

“When Kim Kardashian was the victim of that horrific burglary in Paris, she went to ground, she closed down, she gave no interviews for months. You can see how shaken she was.

“But Jussie was adamant that he wanted TV right away. He raised his voice and said, ‘I need to do this right now. I’m a black gay man and people need to know what happened to me. I want to tell my story.’ He wanted media right away.”

During his Feb. 14 appearance on the show, Smollett tearfully told GMA being beaten about the head and berated with racist and homophobic insults.

“This is MAGA country, n—–!” he said he was threatened by the two strangers, who he said he believed were white."

Smollett, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" ignited a furore on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as ""persons of interest"" who were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged January 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of ""new evidence"" from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was ""no evidence to say this is a hoax.""

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that ""information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He added, ""We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Neither Monico nor any of Smollett's previously known representatives could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

""Empire"" debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

Two Nigerian brothers were arrested and then released this week in connection with the incident on January 29. Citing law enforcement sources, CNN reported on Saturday night that they are now “cooperating fully” with the investigation, in which Smollett has become the chief suspect.

Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo are two recurring extras on the set of the TV show 'Empire,' in which Smollett stars, and know him personally.

In the hours after the story was published, Smollett released a fresh statement, not just reiterating that he was a genuine casualty, but insisting that he is now being re-traumatized.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said his legal team.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The lawyers added that the involvement of an unspecified Osundairo brother who Smollett had hired as a personal trainer to ""ready him physically for a music video"" was ""impossible."" They added that their client has “no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources.”

Persistent doubts

According to Smollett, last month’s attack took place as he was returning home from a Subway sandwich shop at 2am. The actor, who is black and gay, was purportedly accosted by two white men, who called him “Empire fa**ot” and “Empire ni***r”. The men allegedly tied a noose around his neck and poured bleach on his head, as one of them shouted “This is MAGA country!” in reference to Donald Trump’s political slogan.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention. https://t.co/EwXFxl5f2m — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) 29 January 2019

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) 29 January 2019

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris called the incident “outrageous,” while another potential 2020 nominee Cory Booker immediately branded the incident a “modern-day lynching,” as part of a wave of sympathy and support for Smollett, who has a history of progressive activism.

Shut the hell up you bitch ass nigga. You will continue to run this country further into the ground and risk lives every time you breathe. You’re not the president. Just a dumpster full of hate. FOH. Sick to my stomach that literal shit currently represents America to the world. https://t.co/qoNWllmZIm — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) 12 January 2018

However, his account of the incident aroused almost immediate skepticism from some quarters, both official and general. Did two Empire-watching Donald Trump supporters happen to be randomly wandering through a deserted Chicago neighborhood when it was -14C outside, carrying a noose and chemicals, and then stumble upon Smollett? Or were they perhaps master stalkers, who could have predicted that the actor would have gone for a tuna sandwich and a salad - both of which remained intact after the attack - at this late hour?

Police also said that they didn’t manage to locate anyone matching the description provided by Smollett, despite studying hundreds of hours of footage from one of the most advanced CCTV systems in the world. Nor could they document the moment of the attack. Two silhouetted figures were identified in the vicinity, but their role remained unclear.

Doubts were compounded when Smollett refused to hand over his phone in the aftermath, and instead presented investigators with a PDF file purportedly showing a record of his calls, which detectives could not consider tamper-proof.

‘MSM uncritically accepted his lies’

Reports over the last week that cited inside sources have put together a radically different account of events.

Smollett purportedly paid $3,500 to the black LGBT-supporting Osundairo brothers to buy a noose and bleach, and play-act the attack, inflicting superficial injuries. Police have found evidence of them buying the rope, while bleach was located during a search of one of their houses.

The Osundairos, who appear to be the shadowy figures in the surveillance footage, departed on a flight to Nigeria hours after the alleged incident, before being arrested the moment they touched down back in the US.

The details have resulted in much gloating online, not least from those claiming that because the story fitted a convenient political narrative, all attempts at critical analysis were abandoned.

However, the story could result in more than just humiliation and career damage for Smollett, who may face up to three years in jail if he is found to have filed a false police report. It also brings attention to an earlier incident, in which police investigated a potential terrorist attack when the actor received an envelope containing white powder at his work address last month. The substance turned out to be ground-up aspirin.

In the wake of allegations that Smollett staged a fake attack that he blamed on Trump supporters, the tweet is not aging very well.

On Saturday, police in Chicago announced that they no longer considered the Empire actor a victim in the alleged attack that took place late at night at the end of January. Smollett had told police that a pair of men attacked him late at night, shouting “This is MAGA country!” in reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, before putting a noose around his neck and pouring a chemical on him. Smollett is a black and openly gay man, and the attack was seen as a potential hate crime.

But police now say that their investigation has shifted amid allegations that Smollett paid a pair of friends to carry out the attack. The potential motive is not known.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement (via Fox News). “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

While Jussie Smollett issued a statement maintaining that he was indeed the victim of a hate crime and pushing back strongly against the most recent reports, many who had originally supported Smollett were criticizing him online. Many said that the allegation indicating that he faked the attack would only serve to hurt the gay and black communities by giving ammunition to critics.

I believed @JussieSmollett until I heard the whole “This is MAGA country” bs. C’mon. Who even says that?

If #JussieSmollett orchestrated this scam and claimed he was attacked because he’s black and gay, the real tragedy will be all of the victims of REAL hate crimes whose stories won’t be believed. pic.twitter.com/XIWwXazg5L — Victor Blackwell CNN (@VictorBlackwell) February 17, 2019

Some had already criticized those who initially defended Smollett, including 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who called the attack a “modern day lynching.” The California Senator has introduced a bill that would make lynching a federal crime, but critics now question her close relationship with Smollett, who had helped her campaign and even accused her of knowing that the attack was a fake.

Getting even more viral attention online was the tweet Smollett wrote in 2016 that blamed people who willingly believed an obvious lie. It was retweeted thousands of times after allegations that he may have staged the attack, and gained a number of mocking responses.

Who is more to blame? A Devil who spreads obvious lies or a fool who chooses to believe those lies and pass them along? ???? #Thoughts — Jussie Smollett (@JussieSmollett) March 22, 2016

Chicago Police have not officially said that Jussie Smollett is a suspect in the alleged attack."

Lawyers for the US actor Jussie Smollett have denied he had any role in an assault last month he alleges was carried out by two white men.

Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on 29 January.

The brothers, who worked as extras on Empire, the show Smollett starred in, have been questioned by Chicago police.

Police have only said the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has shifted.

What have Smollett's lawyers said?

""Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer, and the lawyers said it was ""impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity"".

And the police?

They had questioned the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, last week but the pair were released on Friday and are said to be still co-operating with the investigation.

The brothers had left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last Wednesday.

Police sources told US media the pair had bought rope used in the attack at a nearby hardware store.

Police searching their flat found ropes, masks and bleach, CBS reported.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Ola and Abel Osundairo have both appeared as extras on Empire, a drama about a hip-hop mogul and his family. In this Instagram post, Ola Osundairo (R) is seen alongside Empire creator Lee Daniels (C).

What has Smollett himself said about the alleged attack?

He said two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults as they punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck.

""This is Maga country,"" he says they told him, referring to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.

The actor said he had been ""forever changed"" by the incident."

Smollett has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country!"".

The 35-year-old, who is gay and plays gay character Jamal Lyon in the New York-set hip-hop drama, said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on 29 January. He said they also poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

In response to subsequent made claims on social media, Smollett said his account is ""100% factual and consistent on every level"".

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up two brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria.

They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

However, late on Friday police said they were no longer suspects.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from the actor's lawyers said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement added.

Police said they examined surveillance video but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Law enforcement sources have told muliple media outlets, including CNN, the actor is suspected of paying two Nigerian-born brothers to orchestrate the attack, who were arrested on Wednesday.

But in a statement to the Assosciated Press, Smollett’s solicitor said there was no truth to the claims.

BREAKING: Jussie Smollett attorneys' statement: No truth to reports that ""Empire"" actor played a role in attack on him — The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2019

The siblings were released without charges on Friday due to “new evidence,” a Chicago Police spokesperson said. They are now “co-operating fully” with police, insiders told CNN.

According to TMZ, one of the brothers has turned over his phone and there is a record of a phone call between him and Smollett near the location and time of the supposed attack.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a police source told Deadline.

Sources on Friday told both ABC and CBS that investigators were looking into whether the men helped Smollett stage the attack because he was being allegedly set to be written off the show — something that was denied by Empire’s writers.

The brothers’ lawyer Gloria Schmidt told CBS News they worked with Smollett on the set of his hit TV show Empire, in which he played gay character Jamal, and worked out with him at the gym.

According to Smollett, he was attacked in Chicago during the early hours of January 29 by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him.

The actor, who is gay, alleged one of the men also poured an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

Sources told US TV station Fox 32 there are records that the two brothers had purchased the rope found around Smollet’s neck at a store.

Speaking to US breakfast show Good Morning America on Thursday, Smollett denied he had initially told police his attackers were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and said he was frustrated doubt was being cast over his story.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said.

“And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”"

The 37 best actors who have never won an Oscar 1/37 Jake Gyllenhaal Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain. And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko. Getty 2/37 Pam Grier Pam Grier was not only robbed of an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s classic thriller Jackie Brown, she was robbed of a nomination full stop. Conversely, her co-star Robert Forster picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. Certainly, an oversight from the Academy. Miramax Films 3/37 Jim Carrey Jim Carrey has been nominated for more Grammy Awards than Oscars, having picked up a nomination for ""Best Spoken Word Album for Children"" in 2006 for A Series of Unfortunate Events. The academy, sadly, has never given Carrey a fair chance, despite winning over the world in the likes of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show. Getty Images 4/37 Jessica Chastain Chastain has the aura of an Oscar winner. Somewhere down the line, surely one her roles won her an Oscar? Yet, despite nominations for The Help and Zero Dark, plus stand-out leading roles in films such as Molly’s Game, the actor still does not have a statuette. Getty Images 5/37 James Dean Of James Dean’s three credited film roles, two were nominated for Oscars – Giant and East of Eden (Rebel Without a Cause was not nominated). Only one of his films, Eden, was released before his tragic passing in 1955. Magnum Photos 6/37 John Goodman The Academy members should hang their heads in shame for never nominating John Goodman, one of the finest ever character actors, for an award. Considering his brilliant performances in Raising Arizona (1987), Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) – and those are just his collaborations with the Coen Brothers – he must be wondering what he has to do to be acknowledged by the Academy. Getty Images 7/37 Salma Hayek Salma Hayek’s career highlight, Frida, came within inches of bringing her an Oscar. Yet, it was not to be – the actor was beaten by Nicole Kidman in The Hours, and Hayak has since been ignored by the Academy. Getty Images 8/37 Michelle Pfeiffer Michelle Pfeiffer was one of the most popular actors working in the 1980s and 1990s, nabbing Oscar nominations for Dangerous Liaisons (1988), The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). However, as the ceremonies came and went, no victory followed. Getty 9/37 Rosario Dawson That Rosario Dawson has become more associated with Superheroes than awards is a tragedy. Her roles in Rent, 25th Hour and Sin City have won her praise from critics and fans alike, but there’s still not an Oscar or Golden Globe mention on her IMDB page. Getty Images 10/37 Angela Lansbury You'd think that Angela Lansbury, having won five Tony Awards and six Golden Globes, would have at least one Oscar at home. Not so. Despite her three nominations – for Gaslight (1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) – the Dame is yet to triumph at the Academy Awards. Getty Images 11/37 Oscar Isaac Oscar Isaac, his many fans argue, was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Inside Llewyn Davis. The critically acclaimed Coen brothers film failed to make the Best Picture cut, and poor Isaac, who played the eponymous struggling folk singer to perfection, was left without a nod. He was also overlooked for Ex Machina and A Most Violent Year. Getty Images 12/37 Robin Wright The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Moneyball: Robin Wright has consistently left critics and audiences impressed. And while no Oscars have followed, her work on the TV series House of Card has earned her seven primetime Emmy award nominations. AFP/Getty Images 13/37 Bradley Cooper Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, had won acclaim across the board and looked set for Oscars glory (with a Best Actor award almost within grasp). However, Rami Malek stole victory away from him at the last moment. Perhaps the best run of his career came between 2013 and 2015, when he was nominated for three consecutive acting Oscars: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and American Sniper. Rex Features 14/37 Joaquin Phoenix You would be forgiven for presuming Joaquin Phoenix has an Oscar statuette somewhere at home. Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award. Getty 15/37 Angela Bassett Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What's Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy. Neilson Barnard/Getty Images 16/37 Sigourney Weaver Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979 Corbis 17/37 David Oyelowo Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Getty 18/37 Marilyn Monroe One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy. Rex 19/37 Steve Buscemi The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller's Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award. Getty Images 20/37 Woody Harrelson Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide. Frederick M Brown/Getty Images 21/37 Mia Farrow Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe. Getty 22/37 Idris Elba While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters. Getty Images 23/37 Edward Norton Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it. AFP/Getty Images 24/37 Scarlett Johansson By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar. Getty 25/37 Samuel L Jackson Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset. GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film Festival 26/37 Michelle Williams With four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences. Getty Images 27/37 Annette Bening Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Getty Images 28/37 Kirk Douglas Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry. 29/37 Irene Dunne Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy. Getty Images 30/37 Arthur Kennedy One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win. United Artists 31/37 Albert Finney One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000). Rex 32/37 Deborah Kerr Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance"". Getty Images 33/37 Thelma Ritter Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959). 20th Century Fox 34/37 Glenn Close Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn's most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) . Dave M. Benett 35/37 Amy Adams Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote. AFP/Getty Images 36/37 Richard Burton Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons. Getty Images 37/37 Peter O'Toole Peter O'Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O'Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.

After scouring hundreds of hours of surveillance video, police eventually tracked down the two brothers who are now said to be co-operating with the investigation as attention shifts to Smollett.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source close to the situation told Deadline, revealing that they’re looking into the possibility that Smollett paid them to buy the rope.

Chicago police have “reached out” to Smollett’s attorney “to request a follow-up interview”.

Days after jumping to the Empire star’s defence, Fox – the network that broadcasts the drama – had no comment.

On Thursday, ABC7 claimed ""multiple sources"" had said that police were investigating whether the actor and the ""two persons of interest"" had ""staged the attack allegedly because Smollett was being written off of the show."

Nobody in the media questioned it until it had to because it fit their prejudices about Trump supporters and their tribal obsession with viewing everything through a racial lens.

Now, as the second hoax is coming apart, the media still hasn't learned any lessons.

Jussie Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack against him, directed them to buy items used in the alleged assault and actually rehearsed it with them, sources say. Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack. Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

The media is slowly reluctantly reporting on these developments before rushing off to the next hoax that reinforces all its prejudices."

CHICAGO: Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from US Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

In a statement, Smollett's attorneys, Todd S Pugh and Victor P Henderson, said the actor is ""angered and devastated"" over the recent reports that the investigators believe he may have paid the men to carry out the attack himself.

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" his attorneys said.

The lawyers said that one of two suspects was Smollett's personal trainer for a music video.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" they said.

According to Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago police want to interview Smollett after learning new evidence from two Nigerian brothers who were released on Friday night.

Smollett was attacked on January 29 when he was leaving a restaurant in Chicago. Two men allegedly shouted racial and homophobic slurs towards him before they attacked him.

The actor, who was hospitalised for his injuries, had told the police that the attackers yelled pro-""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) comments during the attack.

Jussie Smollett hiring two Nigerian princes off an email scam to dress up as Trump supporters and attack him is the plot twist we deserve in 2019 — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) February 17, 2019

Now, the latest report on the case is that the two men initially arrested in connection with the assault on Smollett are Nigerian brothers — identified as Ola and Abel Osundairo — and were captured on surveillance video at the time that Smollett said he was attacked. Even quite shocking is that they have now been released following their confession that Smollett reportedly hired them to stage his assault on January 29, 2019. Furthermore, they have been dismissed as suspects and are currently co-operating with the police. It’s a whole lot to take in, I know, and goes further to harm and discredit real victims of racist and homophobic attacks.

Nonetheless, if the story turns out to be a hoax, it shouldn’t be weaponised to invalidate the abuse, violence and dehumanisation that LGBTQ people face, especially in countries where homosexuality is criminalised. This rare, singular case shouldn’t be used to discredit victims of sexual assault, especially queer victims. So far, Smollett is yet to comment on the release of the Nigerian brothers, or make a statement about this new development that has seemingly thrown the authenticity of his attack out of the window."

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

CHICAGO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Chicago police have shifted the direction of their investigation into actor Jussie Smollett’s report of a hate-crime assault and are seeking to interview him again, after releasing two men detained for questioning in the probe, a police spokesman said on Saturday.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was “angered and devastated” by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

11 p.m.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the “Empire” actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers say: “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.

Chicago police earlier Saturday said their investigation of the attack had “shifted” following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released from police custody Friday without being charged.

Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men was the actor’s personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

7 p.m.

Chicago police say “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the “Empire” actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement via Twitter on Friday, February 15.

The Chicago Police Department confirmed to Us Weekly on Friday that the two men had been arrested. Guglielmi told the Associated Press at the time that the men were “persons of interest” and were brought in because of “probable cause that they may have committed a crime.”

The brothers were arrested at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday, February 13. According to Guglielmi, one of the men worked on Empire.

Smollett, 36, was hospitalized on January 29 after two people yelled “racial and homophobic slurs toward him,” Guglielmi told Us, adding: “The offenders began to batter the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim. At some point during the incident, one of the offenders wrapped a rope around the victim’s neck.”

ABC 7 Chicago claimed on Thursday, February 14, that the attack was a hoax, though Guglielmi later said on Twitter that the outlet’s report was “unconfirmed by case detectives” and was “uninformed and inaccurate.” Fox also shot down the “patently ridiculous” allegations that Smollett faked the incident because he was being written off Empire.

Guglielmi told Us on Friday that the singer is being “treated by police as a victim, not a suspect” and there is “no evidence” that proves the attack was a hoax.

In his first TV interview since the ordeal, Smollett admitted to Good Morning America on Thursday that he is “pissed off” at his attackers and those who believe he might be lying.

“It’s like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ‘cause it’s the truth,’” he noted. “Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It’s the truth.’ And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”"

Chicago: Two men who were being questioned in connection with an attack reported by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, have been released without charge, the Chicago Police Department said.

The men, who were arrested on Wednesday, were released on Friday “due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations. Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” said Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, reports cnn.com.

The men arrested were the same two who police previously said were being viewed as “potential suspects”, police spokesperson Tom Ahern said.

Earlier Guglielmi said the two Nigerian brothers were being treated as “potential suspects” and that there was “probable cause that they may have been involved”.

At that time police did not say precisely what the brothers were accused of or what the alleged crime might have been.

The two men and Smollett had some kind of previous affiliation, a police source said, without providing further detail.

Smollett, one of the stars of the TV drama “Empire”, told authorities he was attacked on January 29 by the men who used “racial and homophobic slurs” on him.

There was also a brief struggle, Smollett told police. One attacker had allegedly put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, before running away.

Police has also searched apartment of two other men who were apprehended at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Wednesday night, but they were not considered suspects at that time.

One of the brothers had appeared on “Empire,” according to police.

Authorities previously released surveillance images of two silhouetted figures in the area of the attack and said they were wanted for questioning.

Aurora attacker took gun to work he shouldn't have owned

AURORA, Ill. -- The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn't supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn't even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

""He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,"" Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. ""It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.""

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has 'shifted'

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the ""Empire"" actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett's attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

In Brexit limbo, UK veers between high anxiety, grim humor

LONDON -- It's said that history often repeats itself - the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Many Britons feel they are living through both at the same time as their country navigates its way out of the European Union.

The British government awarded a contract to ship in emergency supplies to a company with no ships. It pledged to replace citizens' burgundy European passports with proudly British blue ones - and gave the contract to a Franco-Dutch company. It promised to forge trade deals with 73 countries by the end of March, but two years later has only a handful in place (including one with the Faroe Islands).

Pretty much everyone in the U.K. agrees that the Conservative government's handling of Brexit has been disastrous. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing this divided nation can agree on.

With Britain due to leave the EU in six weeks and still no deal in sight on the terms of its departure, both supporters and opponents of Brexit are in a state of high anxiety.

Pro-EU ""remainers"" lament the looming end of Britons' right to live and work in 27 other European nations and fear the U.K. is about to crash out of the bloc without even a divorce deal to cushion the blow.

US-backed Syria force says IS holding 1,000 civilians

AL-OMAR OIL FIELD BASE, Syria -- Islamic State militants are preventing more than 1,000 civilians from leaving a tiny area still held by the extremist group in a village in eastern Syria, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian militia fighting the group said Sunday.

""Regrettably, Daesh have closed all the roads,"" Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told The Associated Press, referring to IS by its Arabic acronym.

SDF officials have said the extremists are hiding among civilians in a tented village and using a network of caves and tunnels. IS, which once ruled a proto-state in large parts of Syria and Iraq, is clinging to an area less than a square kilometer (square mile) in the village of Baghouz, in eastern Syria.

The extremists may include high-level commanders, and could be holding hostages among those trapped inside.

Occasional coalition airstrikes and clashes continue inside the village of Baghouz. Artillery rounds were meant to clear land mines for the SDF fighters to advance. SDF commanders say the end of IS' self-declared caliphate is near.

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON -- Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that ""the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.""

Nauert's impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centered on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert's inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

France's yellow vests mark 3 months amid racist tensions

PARIS -- Paris authorities opened an investigation Sunday into anti-Semitic remarks hurled at a noted philosopher during a yellow vest protest in the capital, an incident that raised national concerns about the movement's ascendant radical fringe.

The Paris prosecutor's office said Sunday an investigation was launched into ""public insult based on origin, ethnicity, nationality, race or religion.""

A few demonstrators targeted philosopjer Alain Finkielkraut with insults on the sidelines of a yellow vest protest through Paris on Saturday. The shocking incident prompted criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron and other prominent figures.

Meanwhile, yellow vest demonstrators called for multiple rallies around Paris and some other French cities Sunday, including a march expected to start at the Arc de Triomphe monument. The increasingly divided movement has held protests every Saturday since Nov. 17, but some groups are holding rallies this Sunday to celebrate the movement's 3-month birthday.

An online invitation to Sunday's main Paris march says ""Let's stay peaceful.""

Patrick Caddell, pollster to Jimmy Carter, dies at 68

WASHINGTON -- Patrick Caddell, the pollster who helped propel Jimmy Carter in his longshot bid to win the presidency and later distanced himself from Democrats, has died, a colleague said Saturday night. He was 68.

Caddell died Saturday in Charleston, South Carolina, after suffering a stroke. That's according to Professor Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston, who confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

After working with Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, Caddell eventually drifted away from the Democratic Party and began advising supporters of Republican Donald Trump and was a contributor to Fox News for a time.

Caddell worked for 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, then joined with Carter in the mid-1970s to develop a campaign strategy to overcome the cynicism spawned by the Vietnam War and Watergate. In an oral history for the University of Virginia's Miller Center, Caddell said Carter's best bet was to present himself as an outsider who could help heal the country.

Iran blasts US efforts to turn Europe against nuclear deal

MUNICH -- Iran's foreign minister is blasting the United States' ""unhealthy fixation"" with his country and condemning the Trump administration's efforts to press European countries to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran.

Mohammad Javad Zarif addressed the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, a day after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence prodded European powers Germany, France and Britain to follow Washington in withdrawing from the deal and to ""stop undermining U.S. sanctions.""

The U.S. withdrew unilaterally last year from the 2015 agreement, which offers Iran sanctions relief for limiting its nuclear program.

Zarif says ""we have long been the target of an unhealthy fixation, let's say obsession"" from the U.S. He said Pence ""arrogantly demanded that Europe must join the United States in undermining its own security and breaking its obligations.""

John Collins: Favorite dunker is Hawks teammate Vince Carter

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- John Collins has a favorite dunker. Not surprisingly, it's his Atlanta teammate Vince Carter.

Collins will represent the Hawks in the dunk contest, one of the events during All-Star Saturday Night. The 3-point contest and skills competition are also on the evening docket.

Collins had perhaps the best dunk of the Rising Stars game Friday night, going with a pass off the backboard to himself for a slam over Dallas' Luka Doncic. He says he's got three or four dunks ready to go for Saturday night.

He won't reveal what to expect: ""No hints,"" he said Saturday morning.

From Bogart to millennials: Italian hat maker tries new look

SPINETTA MARENGO, Italy -- Hats off, Bogie.

The traditional Italian hat maker Borsalino, whose fedora has defined the rough-and-tumble images of Robert Redford, Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart, has a plan to appeal more to women and millennials by pushing into high-end fashion, streetwear and even sportswear.

The recent troubles of the company, which has been rescued financially by a private equity fund, underline the difficulties facing Italian companies - not only fashion brands - seeking scale to stay competitive and grow in the age of globalization.

Entering new markets, targeting new demographics and expanding retail presence all require cash. And even the best-laid business plan can be complicated by a company's bad baggage, and Borsalino came with plenty of that.

The 162-year-old hat maker, arguably Italy's oldest fashion brand, was founded in the northwestern Italian city of Alessandria by Giuseppe Borsalino, whose family sold control decades ago. By the time the Swiss-Italian private equity firm Haeres Equita was approached about investing in 2015, the company had been mismanaged and bled dry by the previous owner."

CHICAGO - Chicago police have shifted the direction of their investigation into actor Jussie Smollett’s report of a hate-crime assault and are seeking to interview him again, after releasing two men detained for questioning in the probe, a police spokesman said on Saturday.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama Empire, ignited a furore on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged 29 January assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has retained the services of criminal defence lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Neither Monico nor any of Smollett’s previously known representatives could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

Empire debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

Many (perhaps most) Americans from the beginning suspected that Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad. But not the mainstream media. They fell for it hook, line, and sinker.

You would think that after falling for “tribal elder” Nathan Phillips’ dubious claims last month — to the point of being legally culpable — the media would be a bit more circumspect.

But no. When presented with another enticing opportunity to demonize Trump supporters, they jumped like Pavlov’s dogs at the chance.

TMZ broke the original version of the story late last month in a report alleging that Smollett was the victim of a vicious hate crime:

Upon leaving a Chicago Subway sandwich shop circa 2 AM one sub-zero night in late January, two masked men recognized him as the openly gay black actor starring in Fox’s ‘Empire,’ hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, beat him to the point of breaking his ribs, doused him with bleach, tied a noose around his neck, before pronouncing “This is MAGA Country!” and fleeing.

Detectives now have a receipt for the rope found on Smollett’s neck showing that his Nigerian friends bought it.

There were inconsistencies in Smollett’s story from the beginning, not to mention a continuous flow of leaks from Chicago cops indicating that they were investigating a potential hoax.

Why didn’t Smollett mention that the attackers yelled, “This is MAGA country!” during his first interview? How did he know the race of his attackers if they were completely covered and wearing face masks? Why was he still holding his Subway sandwich when he got back to the apartment? Why did he wait more than 40 minutes before calling the police? Why did he still have the noose around his neck when the police came? Why did he ask them to turn off their body cameras? Where did TMZ get the idea that he had broken ribs? (He didn’t.) Is it really plausible that these racist, anti-gay Trumpies would be out hunting for Smollett at 2 a.m. on one of the coldest nights of the year?

Local reporters did an excellent job of looking for answers to those questions and bringing out the facts before they were officially confirmed by the Chicago Police Department.

But amid all of the questions and inconsistencies, most of the national media *still* uncritically reported Smollett’s tale of being “brutally assaulted” by racist, homophobic Trump supporters — right up to the bitter end.

As Grabien notes, “The national media owed it to their viewers to give this story the circumspect coverage responsible journalism demands.”

But instead, we saw journalists in many cases report Smollett’s highly dubious claims as facts — not allegations. And as his story was rapidly falling apart, Smollett was granted a softball interview on Good Morning America, where he was treated with kid gloves.

Some in the media drew deeper meaning from the incident to indict Trump’s racist America in 2019.

And some even attacked those who raised doubts — like Mercury News’ Martha Ross, who accused Donald Trump Jr. of “promoting a conspiracy theory” because he “seemed to believe” Smollett’s hate crime story was a hoax.

Trump Jr. liked and retweeted posts by people who have suggested that the reported attack early Tuesday in Chicago could be a left-wing hoax, perpetrated by a Hollywood celebrity who has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump’s presidency, according to Splinter News and a review of Trump Jr.’s Twitter feed. Among those promoting this view are conservative commentator Candace Owens, whose post Friday was liked by Trump Jr.

Well, guess what? Trump Jr. and Candace Owens were right. It was “a left-wing hoax perpetrated by a Hollywood celebrity who had been outspoken in his opposition to Trump’s presidency.”

All it took was a working BS detector and some common sense to have doubts about the Smollett’s implausible story — but those are in short supply these days in the MSM, apparently.

“This is America in 2019,” CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin lamented in response to the Smollett’s hate crime story.

She’s actually right about that. But not in the way she thinks."

According to Smollett's account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" before fleeing.

But the actor now appears to be under investigation himself amid claims he staged the incident because he feared he was about to be written out of the popular television show.

Police say the focus of their investigation has ""shifted"" after they received new information about the attack from the alleged assailants.

Police detained two Nigerian brothers, identified as Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo last week, who were recognised from surveillance footage taken in the area of the alleged assault.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett details his alleged attack by two men who he says put a 'rope around my neck' in TV interview

The actor, 36, was even said to have paid for the rope that was used in the alleged assault – with police sources claiming it was rehearsed days before, according to CBS.

Brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, who worked as extras on Empire, are understood to have told detectives that Smollett orchestrated the attack.

The brothers have now been released without charge.

A spokesperson for Smollett's lawyers said: ""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Smollett has hit back at the hoax claims, saying he feels “angered and devastated”.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from his lawyers read.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'I AM NOT LYING'

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, pointed out that one of the brothers was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Ravenswood, at Smollett’s request, according to CBS.

EMPIRE STAR 'PAID FOR ROPE FOR NOOSE'

It has been claimed that the Empire actor paid for the rope.

The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid £2,714 ($3,500) before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

They left for Nigeria later in the day on January 29, hours after the attack.

Documents reportedly prove that one of the Osundairo brothers bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck in Chicago.

The brothers were arrested on Wednesday but were released on Friday without charge after police said new evidence emerged during their interrogations.

Police are now “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

'RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK'

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Jussie, 36, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

He told how he was punched and kicked by masked attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor said he was battered, doused in acid and had a noose put around his neck by the men, who also called him a “f***ot”.

He previously denied claims that he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Cops initially said the Osundairo brothers were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has hit back at claims that the attack was faked.

SMOLLETT DENIES FAKING ATTACK

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

By Saturday, multiple outlets reported that, citing law enforcement sources, Smollett paid two men to stage the incident with him.

In the lead-up to this stunning conclusion, the flagship morning and evening broadcast network newscasts spent 101 minutes and 22 seconds helping to spin Smollett’s original claims from the first newscasts on the night of January 29 after the story broke through the February 14 evening newscasts (excluding teases).

ABC’s behavior was particularly pitiful. Between Good Morning America and World News Tonight, the Disney-owned network was responsible for 52 minutes and 38 seconds of sympathetic coverage. As my colleague Nicholas Fondacaro and Kristine Marsh have reported, Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts gave Smollett a soft platform to spin his tall tale less than 24 hours before it was blown to pieces.

Perhaps most telling about Roberts’s shameful disregard for journalistic ethics was how, on Thursday’s Good Morning America, she never once used the word “alleged” (or a variation of it) when talking about the supposed incident. In other words, ABC and Roberts have some explaining to do.

When broken down by newscast, Good Morning America dedicated 37 minutes and five seconds to Smollett with a total of 15 minutes and 33 seconds over on World News Tonight between January 29 and February 14.

NBC News came in second with 34 minutes and 57 seconds between the first three hours of Today (20 minutes and 55 seconds) and NBC Nightly News (14 minutes and two seconds). And as Fondacaro discovered, the February 13 and 14 editions of NBC Nightly News began to at least hint at problems with Smollett’s story while ABC was giving Smollett a boost.

Concerning length of time spent on the Smollett saga, CBS This Morning and the CBS Evening News showed admirable restraint with a combined 13 minutes and 47 seconds.

But after separating out the two newscasts, the picture becomes even more stark as CBS This Morning was responsible for nine minutes and 38 seconds of that total, leaving just four minutes and nine seconds for the nighttime show anchored by Jeff Glor.

However, the CBS coverage showed another ethical blindspot on the part of CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, who decided on February 4 that she would speak out in defense of Smollett:

KING: I know there are a lot of questions in this case, but I know Jussie Smollett is a really, really good guy. I want justice to be served in this case. You know, the investigation is underway. I'm glad he's all right. Really glad he's okay. NORAH O’DONNELL: And everybody cooperate with the police — KING: And the police say he — he’s cooperating with — in every step of this investigation.

Yikes. It’s probably safe to opine that journalists should exactly be calling balls and strikes on a story based on whether they personally think someone is a “good” or “bad” guy.

While CNN’s Brian Stelter asserted Saturday night (here and here) that the media coverage of Smollett should be applauded and not be seen as a subplot of this fiasco, numbers such as this one for the breathless coverage (at least on the part of ABC and NBC) suggest otherwise.

In reality, the press served as co-passengers in a story with a number of intoxicating facets for the press to hype (ex. an LGBT Hollywood star, late-night in a major U.S. city, and a claim it was likely done by Trump supporters).

Instead, the Jussie Smollett story will likely go down alongside the Duke Lacrosse and University of Virginia fraternity stories in doing real, lasting damage to actual victims of heinous crimes."

Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

According to CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz: “Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

Earlier Saturday, CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported at least one of the brothers bought the thin rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was bought at “the direction of Smollett,” and the brothers were reportedly paid $3,500 before traveling to Nigeria and promised an extra $500 upon their return, said De Mar.

The Daily Mail reports:

Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony. That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison. By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who ‘transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.’

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police was attacked early January 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs. The actor told police they looped a rope around his neck, doused him in an unknown chemical substance and shouted

“This is MAGA country!” before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant.

Smollett’s lawyers said in a statement Saturday evening that their client is “angered” and “further victimized” by claims that he staged his own attack. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the actor’s lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” the statement continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

“.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery,” tweeted Harris. ” This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Previously, Smollett said he was cooperating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on February 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked. “I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Smollett also told Roberts he believes he was targeted due to outspokenness against President Donald Trump and his administration. “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he said.

Earlier this week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama supported Smollett, saying his character on Empire, James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation. Smollett maintains he was the victim of a vicious attack.

Meanwhile, Michael Monico, the high-powered criminal defense attorney representing longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, said Thursday that he is representing Smollett, a sign the 36-year-old may be gearing up for a major legal fight.

TRUMP-BORDER SECURITY

White House indicates Trump to veto disapproval of emergency

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A top adviser to President Donald Trump is indicating that Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove of his declaration of a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller tells “Fox News Sunday” that “the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration.” Asked if that meant Trump was ready to veto, Miller said, “He’s going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed.”

Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration. It is likely to pass Congress, with several Republican senators already indicating they would vote against Trump — though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.

EMPIRE CAST MEMBER-ATTACK

Chicago police seek follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police and representatives for Jussie Smollett aren’t speaking publicly about the investigation into a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

Police said Saturday that the investigation had “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them without charges. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police had reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request a follow-up interview with him.

Pam Sharp, a spokeswoman for Smollett, said Sunday that there were no updates “as of now.” Another spokeswoman, Anne Kavanagh, said she couldn’t comment on whether Smollett had agreed to another interview.

Smollett reported last month that he was attacked by men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs.

Smollett’s lawyers said late Saturday that the actor felt “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault. They also said Smollett would continue cooperating with police.

FACEBOOK-UK REPORT

UK lawmakers recommend stiffer social media regulation

NEW YORK (AP) — A parliamentary committee report is recommending that the United Kingdom government increase oversight of social media platforms like Facebook to better control harmful or illegal content.

A report published Sunday says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator. The report called out Facebook in particular, saying that the site’s structure seems to be designed to “conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions.” The report expands on an earlier report by the committee issued in July .

Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.

TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE-MCCABE

Ex-FBI official: Rosenstein “absolutely” backed Trump probes

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was “absolutely” supportive of the decision to launch investigations into whether President Donald Trump was inappropriately aligned with the Russians or whether he had obstructed justice.

McCabe also said in an interview aired Sunday on “60 Minutes” that the FBI had good reason to investigate whether Trump was in league with Russia following the May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey.

McCabe cited what he said were Trump’s efforts to publicly undermine the investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday night.

In excerpts released last week by CBS News, McCabe also described a conversation about invoking the Constitution to remove Trump from office.

JAPAN-ABE-TRUMP

Abe mum on reports he nominated Trump for Nobel Peace Prize

TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his chief spokesman have declined to say if Abe nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Abe noted while speaking in Parliament on Monday that the Nobel committee does not disclose the parties behind nominations for a half-century. He said, “I thus decline comment.”

The government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that Japan highly valued Trump’s efforts on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, but he echoed Abe in refusing other comment.

Trump said Friday that Abe had nominated him, sending him a “beautiful copy” of a letter sent to the committee. That claim could not be immediately verified.

The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported on Sunday, citing unnamed government sources, that Abe nominated Trump’s at the president’s request.

TRANSGENDER BATHROOM-LAWSUIT

Transgender teen fights to have sex changed on transcript

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A school board in Virginia that was willing to defend its transgender-bathroom policy all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court may finally give up the fight.

The Gloucester County School Board will hold a public hearing Tuesday. It will discuss the possibility of allowing transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.

The meeting comes just months before a trial is set to begin over the board’s current bathroom policy. Former student Gavin Grimm has been suing the board since 2015 for banning him from using boys restrooms.

Grimm is also expanding his case. A federal judge ruled Thursday that Grimm can sue the school board over its refusal to change the gender listed on his high school transcript. The record still lists him as female.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — LeBron James was trading lob pass with Dwyane Wade again, one last time. Lobs from Kyrie Irving once again, too. And after making a stepback 3-pointer late, he stared down Joel Embiid to send a message without saying a word.

Oh, this mattered.

Team LeBron, down by 20 in the second half, finally got firing and went on to beat Team Giannis 178-164 in the All-Star Game on Sunday night. MVP Kevin Durant scored 31 points for Team LeBron, the one that James drafted and led to victory in the captain’s-choice format for a second consecutive season. Klay Thompson scored 20, and James and Kawhi Leonard each scored 19 for the winners.

Giannis Antetokounmpo — the first-time captain — led everybody with 38 points for the club he drafted. Paul George and Khris Middleton each scored 20 points for Team Giannis, which got 17 apiece from Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook.

“We just started making shots,” Durant said.

Durant is now a two-time MVP, also winning it back in 2012. He lauded Charlotte for the weekend.

“Thanks for the hospitality,” Durant said. “It was an amazing weekend. Glad we capped it off with a ‘W.'”

The highlights, as would be expected, were absurdly good, time and again.

Curry slammed the ball off the floor on a first-half fast break and watched it ricochet toward the rim with an apex that flirted with the top of the backboard. Too high for most humans — but Antetokounmpo isn’t most humans. The freakishly long Greek star slammed Curry’s unconventional alley-oop pass home, with both benches reacting in disbelief.

It was not a defensive showcase, as always.

Team Giannis set an All-Star record with 23 field goals in the first quarter, topping the mark of 22 set on four other occasions — by both the West and the East in the first quarter of the 2017 game, and by the West in both the second and third quarters of the 2016 game.

The 53 points tied a one-quarter All-Star record as well, matching the total by the West in the third quarter of the 2016 games and by the East in the first quarter of the 2017 game. But when it was time to get competitive, things tightened up considerably, at least by All-Star standards.

But when Team LeBron used a flurry of 3s to get back into it, everyone on the bench was standing — sometimes running from the bench and onto the court during play, the celebrations a bit more exuberant than what’s usually allowed.

And the All-Star farewells for Miami’s Wade and Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki— the adds to the game by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, in honor of their career bodies of work — were festive, as everyone wanted.

Nowitzki entered the game late in the first quarter and made his first three shots — all of them 3-pointers — before heading back to the bench. Wade checked in not long after Nowitzki took the floor, then started the second half and achieved his primary missions for his last All-Star Game as a player.

He got an alley-oop lob from James.

And he threw an alley-oop lob to James.

Wade dunked, James dunked, and the close friends who entered the NBA together in 2003 and won championships with Miami in 2012 and 2013 got a couple more moments to savor in their final night as on-court teammates.

Wade finished with seven points in 10 minutes, and Nowitzki never returned after his nine-point, four-minute opening stint. When the third quarter ended, every player gathered behind them as Wade and Nowitzki were honored with commemorative jerseys at midcourt.

“Thank you to the commissioner and the NBA for allowing us to both be on this stage again,” Nowitzki said.

“Exactly what Dirk said,” Wade said as he took the microphone. “We’re very thankful for this opportunity. … The game is in great hands. It’s easy to walk away right now.”

TIP-INS

Team Giannis: Antetokounmpo was awarded a first-quarter free throw — but instead of shooting it, he tossed a pass to himself off the backboard. It isn’t legal, and didn’t work, but he didn’t mind. … Joel Embiid had 12 rebounds and Antetokounmpo added 11. … Kemba Walker, the lone Charlotte player in the game, had four points on 2-for-8 shooting.

Team LeBron: James spent part of halftime on the court listening to J. Cole’s performance, then grabbed a hug from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. … New Orleans’ Anthony Davis, who was dealing with a muscle strain in his shoulder, played five minutes and made both of his shot attempts.

SPLAT BROTHERS

Ordinarily “Splash Brothers” in Golden State, Curry went splat — courtesy of Klay Thompson.

Early in the fourth quarter, Curry shot a 3-pointer from the right wing while getting fouled by someone who’s usually his teammate. Thompson gave a dismissive wave, as if to ask “Why’d I do that?” when Curry’s 3 swished. And Curry made the free throw to seal the four-point play.

OLADIPO SPEAKS

Victor Oladipo’s season is over with a leg injury that kept him from playing in the All-Star Game as well. The Indiana Pacers star, however, was watching. “Wish I could be there playing with you guys but I know this will be a good game to watch!” Oladipo tweeted. “I was on Team LeBron last year but this year it’s all about #TeamGiannis! Lets Go Fellas!!!” Oladipo was replaced on the Team Giannis roster by Brooklyn’s D’Angelo Russell.

NO-FIGHT NIGHT

There were no fights, though that didn’t stop the league from bringing in reknowned boxing ring announcer Michael Buffer to deliver his famed “Let’s get ready to rumble” proclamation just before tip-off.

UP NEXT

The next All-Star Game is Feb. 16, 2020, in Chicago.

The Latest: Denny Hamlin wins 2nd Daytona 500 in 4 years

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Denny Hamlin has won his second Daytona 500 in four years, taking the checkered flag for Joe Gibbs Racing a month after Joe Gibbs’ oldest son died following a long battle with a degenerative neurological disease. J.D. Gibbs was 49.

Hamlin predicted a long night of celebrating. He says “I’m going to hate tomorrow, but I’m going to love the rest of my life.”

Hamlin moved out front after a final restart and had teammate Kyle Busch blocking in the final lap. Busch finished second, followed by another JGR teammate, Erik Jones. Defending Cup Series champion Joey Logano was fourth.

Joe Gibbs says “what happened here is really unreal.”

Joe Gibbs Racing and Fox Sports paid tribute to J.D. Gibbs early in the race. The team and the television network recognized Gibbs during the 11th lap of the Daytona 500.

Gibbs’ favorite number was 11, the car number Hamlin has driven for the team since 2005.

US-backed Syria force says IS holding 1,000 civilians

AL-OMAR OIL FIELD BASE, Syria (AP) — The U.S.-backed Syrian militia fighting the Islamic State in its last toehold in Syria says there are over 1,000 civilians trapped in the tiny area and that the militant group is preventing them from leaving.

Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, tells The Associated Press Sunday that IS has closed all the roads in and out.

SDF officials have said the extremists are hiding among civilians in a tented village and using a network of caves and tunnels. IS, which once ruled a proto-state in large parts of Syria and Iraq, is clinging to an area less than a square kilometer (square mile) in the village of Baghouz, in eastern Syria.

The extremists may include high-level commanders, and could be holding hostages.

ELECTION 2020-KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

‘Carer-feeder’: Gillibrand plays up motherhood in 2020 race

WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is cranking up her presidential campaign. But far from trying to hide her working-mom juggle — she’s running on it.

The New York Democrat opens her standard campaign speech vowing to “fight for your children as hard as I would fight for my own.” She’s floated the idea of making an RV trip through Iowa this summer, to be able to prepare meals for her family while she travels to meet supporters.

To be sure her competitors for the nomination mention their children while campaigning. But none is going as far as Gillibrand to highlight her role as caregiver.

The strategy is a clear appeal to a coveted and energized part of the Democratic coalition: young, working women with families.

White House indicates Trump to veto disapproval of emergency

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top White House adviser said on Sunday.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told “Fox News Sunday” that “the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration.” Asked if that meant Trump was ready to veto a resolution of disapproval, Miller added, “He’s going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed.”

The West Wing is digging in for fights on multiple fronts as the president’s effort to go around Congress to fund his long-promised border wall faces bipartisan criticism and multiple legal challenges. After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfill his signature campaign pledge, Trump’s declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC’s “This Week” that his state would sue “imminently” to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.

Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump — though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.

Chicago police seek follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Sunday they’re still seeking a follow-up interview with Jussie Smollett after receiving new information that “shifted” their investigation of a reported attack on the “Empire” actor.

The trajectory of the investigation “shifted” after detectives questioned two brothers about the attack and released them late Friday without charges, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday. He said police also reached out to Smollett’s attorney to request another interview with him.

Guglielmi said Sunday the interview had not yet been conducted. He declined to comment on published reports that police believe Smollett staged the assault or that a grand jury may hear evidence in the case. The reports cited unnamed police sources.

“We’re not confirming, denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we’ve gotten,” he said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked last month by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was returning home from an early morning stop at a Subway restaurant in downtown Chicago. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

UK lawmakers slam Facebook, recommend stiffer regulation

NEW YORK (AP) — British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the U.K., and called for greater oversight of social media companies.

The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.

The report called out Facebook in particular, saying that the site’s structure seems to be designed to “conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions.”

“It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,” the report states. It also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the U.K. Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.

Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

Ex-FBI official: ‘Crime may have been committed’ by Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Sunday that a “crime may have been committed” when President Donald Trump fired the head of the FBI and tried to publicly undermine an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.

McCabe also said in the interview with “60 Minutes” that the FBI had good reason to open a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was in league with Russia, and therefore a possible national security threat, following the May 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.

“And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia’s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, “Why would a president of the United States do that?” McCabe said.

He added: “So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?”

Asked whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was onboard with the obstruction and counterintelligence investigations, McCabe replied, “Absolutely.”

Aurora shooter’s permit was revoked but gun wasn’t seized

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — An initial background check failed to detect a felony conviction that should have barred the man who killed five co-workers and wounded six other people at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant from buying the gun.

Months later, a second background check of Gary Martin found his 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi involving the stabbing of an ex-girlfriend. But it prompted only a letter stating his gun permit had been revoked and ordering him to turn over his firearm to police — raising questions about the state’s enforcement to ensure those who lose their permits also turn over their weapons.

A vigil for the victims , including a university student on his first day as an intern and a longtime plant manager, was held Sunday outside the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago. More than 1,500 people braved snow and freezing drizzle to attend.

Martin, 45, was killed in a shootout with officers Friday, ending his deadly rampage at the plant. His state gun license permit was revoked in 2014, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said.

But he never gave up the .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun he used in the attack. Investigators are still trying to determine what exactly law enforcement agencies did after that letter was sent, Ziman said.

‘Carer-feeder’: Gillibrand plays up motherhood in 2020 race

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kirsten Gillibrand had a flurry of pots on the stove and steak, haddock, peas, steamed vegetables and rice on the menu.

She had a cable news appearance coming up in a few hours, but for now, her 10-year-old son entertained the family goldendoodle, Maple, a few feet away.

The New York senator was game to talk about motherhood, leadership, her policies and her pursuit of the nation’s highest office, she told a reporter. But first she needed to save dinner.

“I need to focus, because I’m about to burn the fish,” she said. “I’ve reached my point of capacity.”

As she cranks up her presidential campaign, Gillibrand isn’t trying to hide her working-mom juggle — she’s running on it. More than any other contender in a field crowded with women, the mom of two is using her dual roles of mother and candidate to pitch herself to Democratic voters.

Warren highlights her work on economic crisis in Vegas stop

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Democrat Elizabeth Warren used her first visit to Nevada as a presidential candidate to describe a squeeze on working families and a political system that she says fails to protect homeowners, including the residents of Las Vegas who were pummeled by the mortgage crisis a decade ago.

The Massachusetts senator spoke about her work as a consumer activist and her role overseeing the bailout of banks and insurers a decade ago, a job that brought her to the city to hear from residents struggling to keep their homes.

Warren said her own family almost lost their home when she was growing up and recalled one man she met in her Las Vegas visit a decade earlier who was one of millions around the country losing his home.

“You better believe one reason that I am in this fight is we can never let this happen again. Never,” Warren told about 500 people at a botanical garden and event center northeast of the Las Vegas Strip.

Warren, fresh off a Saturday swing through South Carolina and Georgia, was bundled up in a puffy coat for the unusually chilly Las Vegas weather as she appeared on an outdoor stage with an American flag backdrop and a faux sandstone formation.

‘Taking their last breath’: IS hides among Syrian civilians

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) — From a self-proclaimed caliphate that once spread across much of Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State group has been knocked back to a speck of land on the countries’ shared border. In that tiny patch on the banks of the Euphrates River, hundreds of militants are hiding among civilians under the shadow of a small hill — encircled by forces waiting to declare the territorial defeat of the extremist group.

A spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fighting the militants said Sunday that the group is preventing civilians from leaving the area, closing a corridor from which nearly 40,000 residents have managed to escape since December.

“They are taking their last breath,” said Dino, an SDF fighter deployed at a base near the front line in the village of Baghouz, about 2 kilometers (1¼ miles) from the militants’ last spot.

An Associated Press team visited the base Sunday, escorted by the SDF, driving past mostly one-story rural houses that were destroyed, a reminder of the cost of the battle. Occasional airstrikes and artillery rounds by the U.S.-led coalition supporting the SDF, meant to clear land mines for the advance, could be seen in the distance.

The road to the base passes through a number of villages and towns from which IS were uprooted in recent weeks.

School board in Virginia may end transgender bathroom ban

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — For nearly four years, Gavin Grimm has been suing his former school district after it banned him from using the boys bathrooms in high school.

Along the way, he’s became a national face for transgender rights. His case almost went to the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated and moved to California but kept fighting.

The school board in Virginia may finally be giving in, although not in court. It will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss the possibility of allowing transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.

“I have fought this legal battle for the past four years because I want to make sure that other transgender students do not have to go through the same pain and humiliation that I did,” he said.

The Gloucester County School Board’s meeting comes just months before a trial is set to begin over its current bathroom rules.

Denny Hamlin cruises to 2nd Daytona 500 victory in 4 years

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Denny Hamlin came to the Daytona 500 determined to honor his late car owner with a victory.

He delivered with a storybook tribute for Joe Gibbs Racing.

Hamlin won NASCAR’s biggest race for the second time in four years Sunday, leading JGR in a 1-2-3 sweep of the podium in overtime. The race and the season have been dedicated to J.D. Gibbs, Joe Gibbs’ eldest son who died last month after battling a degenerative neurological disease.

J.D. Gibbs helped his father start the race team, ran it while Joe Gibbs was coaching the Washington Redskins, was a tire changer on the team’s first Daytona 500 victory and the one who discovered Hamlin during a test session at Hickory Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Hamlin was hired to drive the No. 11 — the number J.D. Gibbs used when he played football — and J.D. Gibbs’ name is on the Toyota.

When Hamlin stopped his car along the frontstretch to collect the checkered flag, he immediately credited J.D. Gibbs.

TMZ reports the Empire actor turned himself during the early hours of Thursday (February 20). He will sit in jail until he attends a bond hearing at 1:30 p.m. CT when will either post bond or be released on his own recognizance.

According to Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Smollett staged the attack because “he was dissatisfied with his salary.”

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why,” Johnson told reporters. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol.

“How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city by making this false claim? Bogus police reports cause real harm.”

Johnson also added Smollett’s wounds were likely “self-inflicted” and suggested he’d sent the “false letter” to FOX Studios shortly before the incident.

Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct on Wednesday (February 20). If convicted, he faces up to three years in prison.

Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a Cook County Grand Jury for filing a false police report. According to TMZ, the Empire actor could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

The indictment was delivered on Wednesday (February 20) after the jurors heard the testimonies and evaluated evidence. The two Nigerian brothers previously arrested for the attack — Ola and Abel Osundairo — told the jurors they staged the assault with Smollett’s help and got paid for it.

The brothers were also caught on camera buying supplies prior to the incident, including ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats.

Smollett filed the report on January 29, claiming he’d been attacked by two men yelling “homophobic and racial slurs.”

Police were suspicious of his story almost immediately. They reportedly found it strange Smollett kept the rope used in the attack around his neck for 42 minutes and knew were the surveillance cameras were.

Earlier this week, Smollett’s attorney issued a statement denying all accusations.

[This article has been updated. The last version was published on February 17, 2019 and can be found below.]

Jussie Smollett’s attorney has issued a statement on behalf of his client, adamantly denying reports the Empire actor staged his own attack.

In a statement obtained by TMZ, Smollett’s lawyer reveals his client is “devastated” by the accusation he hired two men to carry out the assault.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett reported the incident on January 29, which initially appeared to be a possible hate crime. At the time, Smollett claimed two men yelling “racial and homophobic slurs” attacked him outside a Loews Hotel in Chicago.

On Wednesday (February 13), police arrested two Nigerian brothers who were believed to be involved in the attack. They were released without charges on Friday (February 15) and are reportedly fully cooperating with police in light of the “new evidence” authorities have uncovered.

Chicago PD’s Chief Communications Officer confirmed there’s been a change in the case. “The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”

Smollett, who recently appeared on Good Morning America to tell his story, maintains he’s a victim in this case. Police have reached out to Smollett’s attorney for a follow-up interview.

[This article has been updated. The original version was published on February 16, 2019 and can be found below.]

In what has evolved into a complicated case full of twists and turns, police are now suggesting Empire actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated his own attack.

According to CNN, two law enforcement sources privy to the details of the investigation say Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to execute the plan. One of the men had appeared on Empire in the past.

The two brothers were arrested by Chicago authorities on Wednesday (February 13) but were eventually released without charges after detectives discovered the “new evidence.” They are now reportedly fully cooperating with police.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained they were set free “due to new evidence as a result of today’s investigations.” He added, “And detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

Smollett called the police in the early morning hours of January 29, claiming he’d been assaulted by two men hurling “racial and homophobic slurs” near the lower entrance of a Loews Hotel. He said one of his attackers placed a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

There are records showing the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a local hardware store.

Almost immediately, Smollett’s account of what happened raised suspicions, with many questioning the validity of his story.

Following the alleged attack, Smollett appeared on Good Morning America and expressed his frustrations. He was disappointed so many people were doubting his story and accusing him of lying.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Smollett also denied ever telling the police his attackers were wearing MAGA hats.

“I never said that,” he said.”I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a faggot, they called me a nigger. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Chicago police say “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the “Empire” actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guglielmi’s comment.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was “angered and devastated” by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn’t supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn’t even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

“He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,” Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. “It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.”

Aurora shooting victims ranged from intern to plant manager

CHICAGO (AP) — The victims of a disgruntled employee who opened fire at a suburban Chicago industrial warehouse were co-workers ranging from an intern to the plant manager. A look at the victims:

TREVOR WEHNER

The 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student was on his first day as an intern in human resources at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora and attended the fateful meeting where the gunman was fired and then started shooting.

Jay Wehner said his nephew grew up about 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Aurora in Sheridan and was expected to graduate from Northern Illinois University in May with a degree in human resource management. He was on the dean’s list at NIU’s business college.

“He always, always was happy,” Jay Wehner said. “I have no bad words for him. He was a wonderful person. You can’t say anything but nice things about him.”

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has ‘shifted’

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON (AP) — Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that “the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.”

Nauert’s impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centred on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert’s inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans’ 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) — An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google’s or Apple’s.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration’s attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate’s apparently decades-long predatory sexual behaviour.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic coverups by the Catholic church’s hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming’s role

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county’s beaches, South Carolina’s top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

“We’re getting into this sort of unknown territory,” Webster said. “We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this — it’s unheard of.”

Scientists say the Earth’s warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018’s Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months’ worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia — an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation’s first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who’s yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice-President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Patrick Caddell, pollster to Jimmy Carter, dies at 68

WASHINGTON (AP) — Patrick Caddell, the pollster who helped propel Jimmy Carter in his longshot bid to win the presidency and later distanced himself from Democrats has died, a colleague said Saturday night. He was 68.

Caddell died Saturday in Charleston, South Carolina, after suffering a stroke. That’s according to Professor Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston, who confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

After working with Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, Caddell eventually drifted away from the Democratic Party and began advising supporters of Republican Donald Trump and was a contributor to Fox News for a time.

Caddell worked for 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, then joined with Carter in the mid-1970s to develop a campaign strategy to overcome the cynicism spawned by the Vietnam War and Watergate. In an oral history for the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, Caddell said Carter’s best bet was to present himself as an outsider who could help heal the country.

Caddell consulted with other Democratic candidates in the 1980s and was a close adviser to Joe Biden during his failed 1988 bid for the presidency.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) — In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: “I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” he joked at the time.

Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighbourhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats who have been political adversaries for years, trumpeted the decision as a major coup after edging out more than 230 other proposals.

But what they didn’t expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon’s dramatic Valentine’s Day breakup with New York.

Immediately after Amazon’s Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett's attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

“We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Lawyers for Smollett later issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimised” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from Todd Pugh and Victor P Henderson said.

Smollett has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA (Make America Great Again) country!”.

He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on January 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up two brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late on Friday, police said they were no longer suspects.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from the actor’s lawyers said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement added.

Police said they combed surveillance video but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

AURORA, Ill. (AP) - An initial background check failed to detect a felony conviction that should have barred the man who killed five co-workers and wounded six others at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant from buying the gun.

Months later, a second background check of Gary Martin found his 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi involving the stabbing of an ex-girlfriend. But it prompted only a letter stating his gun permit had been revoked and ordering him to turn over his firearm to police - raising questions about the state's enforcement to ensure those who lose their permits also turn over their weapons.

A vigil for the victims, including a university student on his first day as an intern and a longtime plant manager, was scheduled for Sunday in Aurora, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.

Martin, 45, was killed in a shootout with officers Friday, ending his deadly rampage at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora. His state gun license permit was revoked in 2014, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said.

But he never gave up the .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun he used in the attack. Investigators are still trying to determine what exactly law enforcement agencies did after that letter was sent, Ziman said.

White House indicates Trump to veto disapproval of emergency

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - President Donald Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top White House adviser said on Sunday.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration."" Asked if that meant Trump was ready to veto a resolution of disapproval, Miller added, ""He's going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed.""

The West Wing is digging in for fights on multiple fronts as the president's effort to go around Congress to fund his long-promised border wall faces bipartisan criticism and multiple legal challenges. After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfill his signature campaign pledge, Trump's declared national emergency Friday shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told ABC's ""This Week"" that his state would sue ""imminently"" to block the order, after the American Civil Liberties Union and the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen announced Friday they were taking legal action.

Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump - though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.

'Taking their last breath': IS hides among Syrian civilians

BAGHOUZ, Syria (AP) - From a self-proclaimed caliphate that once spread across much of Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State group has been knocked back to a speck of land on the countries' shared border. In that tiny patch on the banks of the Euphrates River, hundreds of militants are hiding among civilians under the shadow of a small hill - encircled by forces waiting to declare the territorial defeat of the extremist group.

A spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fighting the militants said Sunday that the group is preventing civilians from leaving the area, closing a corridor from which nearly 40,000 residents have managed to escape since December.

""They are taking their last breath,"" said Dino, an SDF fighter deployed at a base near the front line in the village of Baghouz, about 2 kilometers (1¼ miles) from the militants' last spot.

An Associated Press team visited the base Sunday, escorted by the SDF, driving past mostly one-story rural houses that were destroyed, a reminder of the cost of the battle. Occasional airstrikes and artillery rounds by the U.S.-led coalition supporting the SDF, meant to clear land mines for the advance, could be seen in the distance.

The road to the base passes through a number of villages and towns from which IS were uprooted in recent weeks.

Family: UK teen who joined Islamic State has baby in Syria

LONDON (AP) - The family of a British teenager who ran away to join the Islamic State group and now wants to return to the U.K. said Sunday she has given birth to a baby boy.

The family's lawyer said 19-year-old Shamima Begum and the baby are in good health. In a recent interview with The Times newspaper, Begum said she had previously lost two babies to illness and malnutrition.

News about Begum and her desire to go back to Britain have ignited a debate in the U.K. about how to deal with citizens who joined IS and want to leave Syria now that the extremist group is on the verge of collapse.

Begum was one of a group of schoolgirls from London's Bethnal Green neighborhood who went to Syria to marry IS fighters in 2015 at a time when the group's online recruitment program lured many impressionable young people to its self-proclaimed caliphate.

Speaking to Britain's Sky News from Syria, where she has been living in a refugee camp, Begum said she didn't know what she was getting into when she left and wants to bring her baby back to Britain with her.

'Carer-feeder': Gillibrand plays up motherhood in 2020 race

WASHINGTON (AP) - Kirsten Gillibrand had a flurry of pots on the stove and steak, haddock, peas, steamed vegetables and rice on the menu.

She had a cable news appearance coming up in a few hours, but for now, her 10-year-old son entertained the family goldendoodle, Maple, a few feet away.

The New York senator was game to talk about motherhood, leadership, her policies and her pursuit of the nation's highest office, she told a reporter. But first she needed to save dinner.

""I need to focus, because I'm about to burn the fish,"" she said. ""I've reached my point of capacity.""

As she cranks up her presidential campaign, Gillibrand isn't trying to hide her working-mom juggle -- she's running on it. More than any other contender in a field crowded with women, the mom of two is using her dual roles of mother and candidate to pitch herself to Democratic voters.

School board in Virginia may end transgender bathroom ban

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - For nearly four years, Gavin Grimm has been suing his former school district after it banned him from using the boys bathrooms in high school.

Along the way, he's became a national face for transgender rights. His case almost went to the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated and moved to California but kept fighting.

The school board in Virginia may finally be giving in, although not in court. It will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss the possibility of allowing transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.

""I have fought this legal battle for the past four years because I want to make sure that other transgender students do not have to go through the same pain and humiliation that I did,"" he said.

The Gloucester County School Board's meeting comes just months before a trial is set to begin over its current bathroom rules.

Return to sender: High court to hear undeliverable mail case

WASHINGTON (AP) - Mitch Hungerpiller thought he had a first-class solution for mail that gets returned as undeliverable, a common problem for businesses that send lots of letters.

But the process he helped develop and built his small Alabama technology company around has resulted in a more than decadelong fight with the U.S. Postal Service, which says his solution shouldn't have been patentable. The David vs. Goliath dispute has now arrived at the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the justices will hear Hungerpiller's case, which involves parsing the meaning of a 2011 patent law.

""All I want is a fair shake,"" said Hungerpiller, who lives in Birmingham and is a father of three.

Hungerpiller, 56, started thinking seriously about returned mail in 1999 when he was doing computer consulting work. While visiting clients he kept seeing huge trays of returned mail. He read that every year, billions pieces of mail are returned as undeliverable, costing companies and the Postal Service time and money.

So he decided to try to solve the problem. He developed a system that uses barcodes, scanning equipment and computer databases to process returned mail almost entirely automatically. His clients, from financial services companies to marketing companies, generally direct their returned mail to Hungerpiller's company, Return Mail Inc., for processing. Clients can get information about whether the mail was actually correctly addressed and whether there's a more current address.

Polish PM cancels Israel visit amid new Holocaust tensions

WARSAW, Poland (AP) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.

Morawiecki informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's of his decision by phone Sunday, Michal Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.

It ""is a signal that the historical truth is a fundamental issue for Poland, and the defense of the good name of Poland is and always will be decisive,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek explained.

Netanyahu said Thursday during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that ""Poles cooperated with the Nazis"" - wording suggesting that some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.

He was initially quoted by some Israeli media outlets as saying not ""Poles"" but ""The Poles"" cooperated, phrasing which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.

Disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner released from prison

AYER, Mass. (AP) - Disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has been released from federal prison after being convicted of having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl in 2017.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons website shows the 54-year-old New York Democrat is currently in the custody of its Residential Re-entry Management office in Brooklyn, New York.

It's not immediately clear when Weiner was transferred and where he's staying now, but Weiner will have to register as a sex-offender and spend three years on supervised release under the terms of his sentence.

The prison bureau, federal prosecutors in New York and Weiner's lawyer didn't respond to emails seeking comment Sunday.

Weiner began serving a 21-month prison sentence at the Federal Medical Center Devens, located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston in Ayer, Massachusetts, in November 2017.

Patrick Caddell, pollster to Jimmy Carter, dies at 68

WASHINGTON (AP) - Patrick Caddell, the pollster who helped propel Jimmy Carter in his longshot bid to win the presidency and later distanced himself from Democrats, has died, a colleague said Saturday night. He was 68.

Caddell died Saturday in Charleston, South Carolina, after suffering a stroke. That's according to Professor Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston, who confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

After working with Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, Caddell eventually drifted away from the Democratic Party and began advising supporters of Republican Donald Trump, including a close relationship with former Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, and was a contributor to Fox News for a time.

Caddell worked for 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, then joined with Carter in the mid-1970s to develop a campaign strategy to overcome the cynicism spawned by the Vietnam War and Watergate. In an oral history for the University of Virginia's Miller Center, Caddell said Carter's best bet was to present himself as an outsider who could help heal the country.

As a student at Harvard, Caddell had studied Southern politics and was helpful to Carter and his close advisers as they studied how to maneuver their campaign between the competing forces of the McGovern liberals and supporters of conservative firebrand George Wallace."

CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the investigation of the attack on Jussie Smollett (all times local):

11 p.m.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the “Empire” actor played a role in an assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers say: “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.

Chicago police earlier Saturday said their investigation of the attack had “shifted” following the interrogation of two men. The brothers from Nigeria were first considered suspects, but then released from police custody Friday without being charged.

Smollett’s attorneys say that one of the men was the actor’s personal trainer, hired to prepare him physically for a music video.

7 p.m.

Chicago police say “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the “Empire” actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant early on Jan. 29. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guglielmi’s comment.

US actor Jussie Smollett has denied a homophobic attack he claims to be the victim of was staged after reports police believe he paid men to do it.

The 36-year-old Empire star says he was assaulted in Chicago last month, but two men arrested in connection with the alleged attack have been released without charge.

CNN now reports police believe Smollett may have paid the men to carry out the attack himself, something he has strongly denied.

According to Smollett his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" before fleeing.

Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday police arrested two Nigerian brothers described as ""persons of interest"", recognised from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged assault.

Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo were freed two days later without charge in light of ""new evidence"" from their interrogation.

The pair - who reportedly work as extras on Empire and are known to the alleged victim - are no longer being classified as suspects.

CNN then reported two unnamed law enforcement sources as saying the brothers were co-operating with the force and there may have been a payment involved.

In response Smollett's legal representatives issued a statement to Entertainment Weekly condemning any allegations of a hoax.

It said: ""As a victim of a hate crime who has co-operated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.

""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to co-operate.

""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation but will continue discussions through official channels.""

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied reports officers were investigating whether Smollett staged the attack because he was being written out of the television show.

""While we haven't found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,"" he said.

""The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.""

""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" the Chicago Police Department added in a statement.

News of the alleged attack on Smollett sparked outrage but some have doubted his account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, the producer of ""Empire"" released a statement on Thursday saying the idea that Smollett has been, or would be, written out of the show was ""patently ridiculous,"" and that they continue to stand behind him."

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn’t supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn’t even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

“He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,” Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. “It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.”

Aurora shooting victims ranged from intern to plant manager

CHICAGO (AP) — The victims of a disgruntled employee who opened fire at a suburban Chicago industrial warehouse were co-workers ranging from an intern to the plant manager. A look at the victims:

TREVOR WEHNER

The 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student was on his first day as an intern in human resources at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora and attended the fateful meeting where the gunman was fired and then started shooting.

Jay Wehner said his nephew grew up about 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Aurora in Sheridan and was expected to graduate from Northern Illinois University in May with a degree in human resource management. He was on the dean’s list at NIU’s business college.

“He always, always was happy,” Jay Wehner said. “I have no bad words for him. He was a wonderful person. You can’t say anything but nice things about him.”

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has ‘shifted’

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON (AP) — Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that “the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.”

Nauert’s impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centred on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert’s inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans’ 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) — An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google’s or Apple’s.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration’s attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate’s apparently decades-long predatory sexual behaviour.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic coverups by the Catholic church’s hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming’s role

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county’s beaches, South Carolina’s top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

“We’re getting into this sort of unknown territory,” Webster said. “We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this — it’s unheard of.”

Scientists say the Earth’s warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018’s Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months’ worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia — an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation’s first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who’s yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice-President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) — In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: “I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” he joked at the time.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, Smollett’s lawyers, told ABC News. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,” they continued. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

Smollett’s statement follows reports that the Chicago Police Department now suspect the actor-singer staged the alleged assault on himself.

CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz tweeted Saturday evening: “Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

Earlier Saturday, CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reported at least one of the brothers bought the thin rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was bought at “the direction of Smollett,” and the brothers were reportedly paid $3,500 before traveling to Nigeria and promised an extra $500 upon their return, said De Mar.

The eyebrow-raising developments come after Chicago police released the two brothers due to “new evidence” obtained in their interrogations. “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police, said.

In a phone interview with New York Times reporter Sopan Deb, Guglielmi said detectives “reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again.”

The Osundairo brothers were arrested Wednesday by police at O’Hare Airport after returning from a trip to Nigeria to visit family, and brought in for questioning. They were seen on surveillance video in the neighborhood where the alleged incident took place.

Smollett, a gay African-American, told police that two masked men yelling racist and anti-gay insults assaulted him January 29. He told police the men doused him with an unknown chemical substance and place a rope around his neck before shouting “This is MAGA country!” and fleeing.

Smollett has contended that he has been “100% factual and consistent on every level” regarding the alleged attack. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he told ESSENCE magazine in his first statement after the incident.

Meanwhile, Michael Monico, the high-powered criminal defense attorney representing longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, revealed Thursday that he is also representing Smollett, a sign the actor-singer may be gearing up for a major legal battle. Under State of Illinois law, Smollett could get between one to three years in prison for filing a false police report."

AURORA, Ill. (AP) — The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn’t supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn’t even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometres) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

“He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,” Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. “It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.”

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has ‘shifted’

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON (AP) — Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that “the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.”

Nauert’s impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centred on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert’s inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans’ 2010 census data

WASHINGTON (AP) — An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google’s or Apple’s.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration’s attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate’s apparently decades-long predatory sexual behaviour.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic coverups by the Catholic church’s hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming’s role

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county’s beaches, South Carolina’s top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

“We’re getting into this sort of unknown territory,” Webster said. “We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this — it’s unheard of.”

Scientists say the Earth’s warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018’s Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months’ worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia — an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation’s first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who’s yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice-President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Patrick Caddell, pollster to Jimmy Carter, dies at 68

WASHINGTON (AP) — Patrick Caddell, the pollster who helped propel Jimmy Carter in his longshot bid to win the presidency and later distanced himself from Democrats has died, a colleague said Saturday night. He was 68.

Caddell died Saturday in Charleston, South Carolina, after suffering a stroke. That’s according to Professor Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston, who confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

After working with Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, Caddell eventually drifted away from the Democratic Party and began advising supporters of Republican Donald Trump and was a contributor to Fox News for a time.

Caddell worked for 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, then joined with Carter in the mid-1970s to develop a campaign strategy to overcome the cynicism spawned by the Vietnam War and Watergate. In an oral history for the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, Caddell said Carter’s best bet was to present himself as an outsider who could help heal the country.

Caddell consulted with other Democratic candidates in the 1980s and was a close adviser to Joe Biden during his failed 1988 bid for the presidency.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK (AP) — In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: “I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes,” he joked at the time.

Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighbourhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia.

Trump’s actions have been greeted with now-familiar claims that he is sparking a constitutional crisis or threatening the rule of law.

Considering just the substance of what Trump has done, these are large exaggerations. Everything Trump proposes to do purports to be grounded in congressional statutes and much of what he aims to do does not rely on emergency power. Trump is not relying solely on Article II executive power, and he is not invoking executive power to disregard a congressional statute. Moreover, the statutes in question expressly give Trump authority in the areas in which he claims them.

There will be questions—some of them hard, and without obvious answers—about whether Trump’s legal team has interpreted these congressional authorizations, and the conditions on their use, accurately. But abstracting away for a moment from the deeply divisive context in which Trump has asserted these authorities, the types of statutory claims he is making based on delegated power are nothingburgers from the perspective of executive branch practice, especially in the foreign relations context. The executive branch every day relies on vague or broad or dim delegations of authority, and courts usually uphold these actions. And as Trump himself stated many times, courts will ultimately sort out his claimed statutory authority in the wall context as well.

Nor is Trump’s claim of emergency power outlandish—at least by the standards of past presidential practice. Many charge that Trump is declaring an emergency when there is no emergency. But this begs all the relevant questions. The relevant statute on which Trump relies does not define the term “emergency.” Presidents have always—really, always—had discretion to decide if there’s an emergency. And presidents have often declared emergencies under circumstances short of necessity, to address a problem that does not rise to an “emergency” as defined in common parlance to mean “a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.”"

(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)

Jussie Smollett, the Trump-despising star of television’s Empire who has said he was attacked by two guys yelling a pro-Trump slogan, has now hired the lawyer for Trump’s lawyer to defend him in any criminal matters that may emerge from what he claims is a vicious January 29 attack.

Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor who has been representing Michael Cohen during the latter’s legal troubles, said on a Chicago radio show that he was now representing Smollett.

Meanwhile, two African-American brothers, U.S. citizens from Nigeria who, according to their lawyer, are friends of Smollett and work out at Smollett’s gym (and one of whom has appeared on Empire), were held by police this week but released after 48 hours of questioning without charge. (The police didn’t identify them but several media outlets reported their names and what their lawyer said about them.) Something they said has apparently given the police hope of solving the case.

Local Fox32 News reporter Rafer Weigel, who has been following the case closely, reported on Twitter that his police sources were able to prove that the brothers purchased the rope that was taken into evidence after it was used in the alleged assault on Smollett. “The brothers agreed to cooperate with police who are investigating whether Smollett made up the story after police threatened to charge them with battery,” Weigel wrote, adding, “There are unconfirmed reports that Smollett paid the two brothers to perform the alleged scheme.”

The two men held without charge by police are the same two men seen in the vicinity of Smollett at the approximate time of the attack on a previously released surveillance video. Smollett said on Good Morning America this week that he was certain those two men are the ones who attacked him. The reason the brothers were near Smollett on the night in question is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time,” Chicago Police told ABC News. They also said the information gleaned from the two men questioned “could change the story entirely.”

A Chicago police spokesman has continued to maintain that Smollett is not considered a suspect and that he is considered a victim of a potential crime. Which raises a question: Why would the victim of a brutal attack hire a criminal-defense attorney? Why would he need a lawyer at all?"

Immediately after Amazon’s Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives.

According to Variety, Jussie Smollett told Chicago police that he was attacked by two men wearing masks in late January. The actor revealed that the men yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him to get his attention and then poured a chemical substance on him before hitting him with their hands and putting a rope around his neck.

Jussie went to the hospital but was soon released with only minor injuries following the attack. Rumors began to fly about Smollett’s involvement in the attack when the actor refused to hand over his phone records, and when he finally did, police claimed the records were redacted.

Finally, cops got two suspects and arrested a set of brothers, whom they believed to be the attackers. However, it is now being reported that Smollett knows the suspects and that one of them is his personal trainer.

After allegations that Jussie Smollett may have paid off the men to attack him in order to possibly gain more fame or have a platform to become more of an activist. However, after the allegations surfaced online, the actor released a statement denying any involvement in the incident and said that he is both “angered and devastated” over the allegations.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” Smollett’s attorneys, Victor P. Henderson and Todd S. Pugh, said in a statement on the actor’s behalf.

The statement continues to state Jussie’s innocence and reveals that the actor will keep working with the Chicago Police Department in hopes of getting the story straight and figuring out what happened on the night of his attack.

The lawyers also claim that their client is the victim of a hate crime, and he continues to feel victimized by the rumors swirling around him at this time.

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement continues.

Many fans are now unsure what to believe, but that Chicago P.D. has revealed that if Jussie Smollett did have something to do with staging his own attack, they will file charges against the Empire actor."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say ""the trajectory of the investigation"" into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the ""Empire"" actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

CNN on Saturday cited CPD sources as saying that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers, the persons of interest questioned this week by police, to help him stage the attack, which had originally been described as racist and homophobic.

Later on Saturday, Chicago PD communications director Anthony Guglielmi said, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police … has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.” Our sister site Deadline meanwhile quoted a source as saying “the new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.”

The statement from Smollett’s lawyers, issued late Saturday evening, said, “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

One of the aforementioned persons of interest is said to have worked as an extra on Empire, while Smollett’s lawyers confirmed that one of the men worked as Smollett’s trainer for a music video. Both were released by police on Friday without charges.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” said the lawyers’ statement.

On Thursday, in the wake of local Chicago news reports suggesting the attack was a hoax, the Chicago PD said that that theory was “unconfirmed by case detectives” and that Smollett was still being considered a victim."

Police sources believe that, as many had suspected, “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett perpetrated an enormous hoax on the American public by staging a phony hate crime.

Now we’re waiting for apologies from the celebrities and top Democrats who not only expressed sympathy for the supposed victim of violent hate, but turned around and cited President Trump and his supporters as having somehow inspired the attack.

Which was itself pretty foolish, since much of his story seemed implausible from the start. For one thing, Smollett’s account of what took place in the frigid early-morning hours of Jan. 29 kept changing.

Smollett claimed he was set upon at approximately 2 a.m. on a freezing night by two white men who recognized him and began beating him while uttering anti-black and anti-gay slurs, as well as “this is MAGA country” — and also draped a rope around his neck.

Yet surveillance cameras showed there was at most a 60-second window for the attack, which is highly unlikely. He also waited 40 minutes before calling police, later claiming he didn’t want to further the stereotype of gay people being “weak.”

Moreover, he refused to hand over his cellphone (he said he’d been talking to his manager when the attack occurred), eventually turning over only “heavily redacted” phone records.

That’s a whole lot of red flags — especially considering the not-inconsiderable number of similar hoaxes, also widely publicized, perpetrated in recent years.

Yet Democratic presidential hopefuls jumped on the hysteria train.

As National Review’s Jim Geraghty notes, it’s one thing to be sympathetic to an apparent victim — and quite another to hold a large group of people, including the president of the United States, responsible without any factual basis."

Pic credit: ©ImageCollect.com/Admedia

When law enforcement took two men into custody earlier this week, it looked like Jussie Smollett was going to get justice. After they were let go, with investigators citing new evidence in the apparent hate crime against the Empire actor, everyone was left wondering what was going on.

It seemed impossible to believe that the Jussie Smollett attack was staged, but now evidence suggests that could have been what happened. On Saturday, CNN claimed that two law enforcement sources reported that the men taken into custody may have been paid to stage the attack on Smollett.

The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were arrested and questioned before law enforcement released them. As Monsters & Critics previously reported, news that Jussie Smollett hired a criminal lawyer came soon after.

Reports that the Osundairo brothers were released after presenting new evidence in the case, coupled with their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, revealed that they were at the scene of the alleged attack and that they would tell their story “in their own time.”

Smollett previously told law enforcement that he was attacked in the early hours of January 29 when he left his apartment to get food from a local Subway eatery. He claimed that his attackers put a noose around his neck, poured a bleach-like substance on him after calling him a “ f****t” and a “n****r.”

According to the new report from CNN, the investigation turned up records of the two brothers purchasing the rope that was placed around Jussie Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

At this point, Chicago investigators are looking at Jussie Smollett as an “active participant” in the attack. The investigation continues."

The two brothers identified by CBS as Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo — though police did not release their names — were questioned this week as “potential suspects” then released without charges “due to new evidence” on Friday. CNN cited two law enforcement sources, who said the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

In a statement Saturday night, attorneys for Jussie Smollett strongly denied that the “Empire” star faked the attack he reported on Jan. 29, and said “anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in their statement that the actor “has been further victimized” by these claims, and identified one of the men police arrested, then released without charges on Friday, as Smollett’s personal trainer.

The trainer, who was unnamed in the statement, was preparing Smollett for a music video, the statement said. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement continues.

Here’s the full statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.

CNN’s sources said records show that the two brothers, whom TheWrap confirmed with police are of Nigerian descent, purchased the rope at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

The actor has pushed back on past speculation, shared on social media, that the attack was a hoax. In an interview with “Good Morning America” this week, he said people would be more likely to believe him if he had said his attackers were Muslim, Mexican or black.

An attorney for the two men, Gloria Schmidt, did not respond to requests for comment.

But the Chicago Tribune reported Schmidt has previously said that the two brothers have worked with Smollett on “Empire” and work out at the same gym as the actor. Smollett follows their bodybuilding page (@team_abel) on Instagram.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that he was battered “about the face,” that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on him, and that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck. The substance turned out to be bleach.

On Saturday morning, a rep for Smollett denied reports that the actor had hired defense attorney Michael D. Monico. Monico, who is currently on Michael Cohen’s defense team, had said Thursday on WGN’s “The Roy Conn Show” that Smollett was his client “at the moment.”

Monico declined to comment when contacted by TheWrap Saturday about whether he repped Smollett.

A Fox representative declined comment Saturday."

The entire thing was apparently staged, just as we predicted would finally come out. Naturally, the entire Trump-hating left-wing media went along with the ploy without a scintilla of fact checking. Just the claim alone — that MAGA-hat wearing Trump supporters attacked Smollett for being black and gay — was enough for virtually every liberal media outlet to proclaim the attack happened just as Smollett had described.

Now it’s increasingly obvious the entire thing was staged. As PJ Media now reports in breaking news:

On Saturday night, Chicago Police confirmed to PJ Media that the testimonies of two black men arrested in the case of “Empire” star Jussie Smollett have flipped the story. Rather than considering Smollett the victim of an attack, it appears that police may now see him as the perpetrator of a hoax.

“The Chicago Police Department believe Empire actor Jussie Smollett staged an attack on himself last month,” reports Breitbart.com:

“Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement,” tweeted CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz Saturday evening.

Earlier Saturday, Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel, citing several police sources, reported Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — the two Nigerian brothers arrested and later questioned by police about the alleged incident — purchased the rope found around the actor’s neck the night of the alleged attack at an ACE hardware store.

CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reports at least one of the brothers bought the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was purchased at the direction of Smollett, De Mar, citing sources, added.

Further, the brothers were paid $3,500 before traveling to Nigeria and promised an extra $500 upon their return, according to De Mar.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on January 29 before fleeing the scene.

#Breaking: 2 #CPD sources tell @fox32news the brothers arrested & released in #JussieSmollett case told detectives they were paid by the #Empire actor to orchestrate the attack. Detectives also have a receipt for the rope found on #Smollett neck showing the brothers bought it. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 17, 2019

Jussie Smollett has now hired a high-profile criminal defense attorney, reports The Gateway Pundit. He’s probably going to need it… (gosh, no wonder SJWs hate the police; especially when police expose their fake hate crimes.)

UPDATE: Smollett is continuing to proclaim his innocence in all this. “Lawyers for Empire actor Jussie Smollett say their client is ‘angered’ and ‘further victimized’ by accusations that he staged his own assault in Chicago last month,” reports Breitbart.com. His lawyers are painting him as “a victim of a hate crime” who is being victimized twice because people are questioning his story. Thus, he’s a double victim of racism, bigotry and homophobia.

We are waiting with great anticipation for another announcement claiming that somehow he’s a triple victim of this obvious hate crime hoax.

The Chicago Police deserve huge credit for their relentless pursuit of the truth on this one

As media reports are now confirming, Smollett reportedly paid his two friends $3500 to stage the attack on him, and they have now turned against him, serving as witnesses for the Chicago PD’s accelerating investigation. What’s especially notable in all this is that the truth only emerged after some truly amazing police work by the Chicago PD. According to various media reports, detectives there identified Smollett’s friends on public video cameras, ran facial recognition on them, identified the men, tracked down their Lyft transport records, acquired proof of them buying the noose prop at a local hardware store, and even subpoenaed Smollett’s phone records to find out what he was covering up.

Now, it looks like Smollett is about to be charged with a multitude of crimes, starting with the filing of a false police report. His alleged use of the U.S. mail to reportedly send himself a threat letter may also involve federal prosecutors, meaning Smollett could be facing many years behind bars due to both local and federal prosecutions of his alleged crimes.

Cartoonish… amateur hour

As it turns out, Smollett’s staged victimhood theater stunt wasn’t too bright to begin with. His two accomplices left a trail of evidence implicating them all, even using their own personal Lyft accounts to get a ride to the location of the staged attack. They reportedly kept the receipt of buying the wire for a noose at a local hardware store, and apparently none of the three used burner phones (throw-away mobile phones). The entire attempt to pull of a national victimhood hate crime hoax that could be used to badger Trump supporters, in retrospect, was almost cartoonish in its lack of planning and brainless execution.

It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story. — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2019

Smollett may be a gifted actor — after all, he still cries on cue and offers a convincing performance of his own innocence — but he’s apparently not too bright when it comes to staging hate crime hoaxes. Then again, most hate crime hoaxes are pulled off by people who aren’t all that bright to begin with, especially since today’s universities spend more time teaching minority students how to be “social justice” victims rather than how to make something of themselves. Rarely do these people think their stories will be questioned, especially given the degree of minority privilege in the media, where minorities are automatically believed, no matter how outrageous their stories or allegations.

Will the national media APOLOGIZE for pushing mass hysteria over a staged fake hoax?

Here’s a montage of all the media hysteria that immediately followed Smollett’s claim of being attacked by racist Trump supporters:

Listen to my podcast on all this, recorded several days ago, before the recent facts confirmed the hoax nature of all this:

10 more hate crime hoaxes just from the year 2018

It seems there are more hate crime HOAXES in America than actual hate crimes. Almost everything that gets blown up by the Trump-hating Left turns out to be a hilarious hoax. Breitbart.com shares a list of 10 hate crime hoaxes from 2018 alone (and there are hundreds more…)

10. In January, it was discovered that a Muslim girl had lied to police in Toronto when she told them a man had “cut off” her hijab.

The hoax quickly gained the attention of Canadian media, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who told reporters that his “heart goes out the young girl who was attacked, seemingly for her religion.” Police concluded that the incident had never occurred.

9. A Long Island woman told detectives in September that four teenagers had confronted her, yelling “Trump 2016!” and that she woke up the next morning to find her tires slashed with a note that read, “Go home.”

The woman ended up being arrested and charged for fabricating the story about the Trump-related hate crime.

8. In July, a Texas waiter shared a photo of a customer’s receipt, which had the words “we don’t tip terrorist” scrawled at the top, along with the waiter’s name “Khalil” circled.

The photo gained national media attention, the waiter was offered donations, and the framed customer was banned from the restaurant. The waiter eventually admitted that he had written the words on the receipt, and that his story was made-up.

7. An Ohio University student told police that she had received homophobic death threats. The student ended up being charged with three counts of “making false alarms” after it was discovered by police that she had sent the death threats to herself.

6. A high school marching band in Georgia decided to display a racial slur during one of their performances. After conducting an investigation, the school’s principal announced that the incident was a hoax.

5. One day before the midterm elections, a black freshman at Kansas State tweeted an image of a racist note attached to his apartment door. In his tweet, the student stated that this “blatant racism” should serve as a reminder that “everyone needs to get out and vote.”

The tweet has since been deleted, and the student later admitted to police that he had created and posted the note to his own door.

4. A waitress at a restaurant in Texas wrote a racial slur against Hispanics on a receipt, claiming that a local law enforcement employee had written it and directed it toward her. The waitress later admitted to the County Sheriff that she herself had written the racist comment.

3. In November, several racist notes surfaced at Drake University, which spurred an investigation, protests, and campus-wide concern for nearly an entire month.

A student who had received one of the notes later admitted to being the one who sent the notes to herself and others. She ended up facing charges and possible expulsion.

2. Chipotle fired one of its managers in November, after a user on Twitter shared a video, accusing her of refusing to serve black customers due to the color of their skin.

It turned out that the manager had been a victim of a race hoax, and had refused the customers due to their known habit of “dining and dashing.” Chipotle has since offered the manager her job back.

1. During the October Kavanaugh hearings, a woman decided to insert herself into the elaborate and infamous watch trial, by writing a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, accusing Brett Kavanaugh of rape.

The woman later admitted that her letter was a hoax, and that she had never met Kavanaugh.

But police had trouble proving that was real, too.

“Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement,” tweeted CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz on Saturday evening.

This new report follows a previous one that suggested police were investigating Smollett and two men they believed Smollett had hired, potentially, to carry out the “attack.”

Also on Saturday, Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel said police sources had told him that Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, two Nigerian brothers with connections to Smollett whom police had questioned, purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an ACE hardware store.

Smollett allegedly requested the men buy the rope.

Smollett may have paid the men $3,500 before they recently flew to Nigeria, reported CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar.

The actor also allegedly promised them another $500 when they got back.

The men were extras on “Empire”; social media posts suggest they went to the same gym as Smollett did.

The Nigerian brothers, through their lawyer, had earlier denied any wrongdoing. “They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then,” Gloria Schmidt said in a public statement.

She continued, “When they first learned about what happened to him, they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that.”

Smollett appears to be sticking to his original story about the attack. “I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” the actor recently told Essence magazine.

“Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

The actor also recently told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he believes he was attacked because he’s been outspoken about President Donald Trump.

“I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he said.

Smollett also suggested people who question his story are racist — and would not be questioning a white man who said he was attacked.

Many liberal politicians and celebrities immediately shared their support for Smollett, no questions asked. And it’s unlikely they’ll apologize for that if it’s found definitively that he lied.

“The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) about the alleged attack.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called it an attempt at a “modern-day lynching.”

Actress Vivica A. Fox said of the alleged incident, in part, “I’m just now hearing the news about the senseless hate attack on my #EMPiRE Nephew @JussieSmollett IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!!”

“Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels posted an emotional Instagram video in support of Smollett. He said in part: “You didn’t deserve … to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you … You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are … Hold your head up, Jussie,”

As for musician Ariana Grande, she wrote on Twitter, “What happened to Jussie makes me really f***ing sick to my stomach. I can’t believe s*** like this is really still happening every day …”

Other celebrities also seemed instantly ready to believe that two Trump supporters would carry out a senseless and horrible attack such as the one Smollett alleged. Check out more reactions below:

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett’s account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an “unknown chemical substance” before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as “persons of interest” who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of “new evidence” from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was “no evidence to say this is a hoax.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that “information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the ‘Empire’ case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added, “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Neither Monico nor any of Smollett’s previously known representatives could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

“Empire” debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

Richard Shotwell/Invision / AP

CHICAGO — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the ""Empire"" actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked early Jan. 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett said he was cooperating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Police released grainy images of two people they said were in the area at the time of the reported attack and said they wanted to question them.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the Nigerian brothers — one of whom they said worked on ""Empire"" — at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

And then on Saturday, Guglielmi said the investigation had shifted."

Two Nigerian brothers arrested Wednesday as potential suspects have cooperated with investigators, claiming they were paid by Smollett to orchestrate an attack against him, police sources told CNN and USA Today.

""Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on Twitter.

Smollett, who is black and gay, had told police in January that he was walking in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville at 2 a.m when he was attacked by two masked men who had shouted racial and homophobic slurs, with one attacker putting a rope around his neck and pouring bleach over him.

Police on Friday released the brothers — identified as ""Empire"" extras Olabinjo and Abel Osundairo — without filing charges after they were picked up at O'Hare International Airport. Sources told CNN and USA Today that the brothers had bought rope at a local hardware store.

ABC7 Eyewitness News in Chicago reported Thursday that police were investigating whether Smollett and the two brothers had staged the attack because Smollett he had been written off of ""Empire."" The Chicago Tribune noted that Smollett follows their bodybuilding page on Instagram.

Smollett was interviewed on Thursday by Robin Roberts of ABC's ""Good Morning, America,"" where he went into detail about the attack and how he was bothered by those who cast doubts that he was telling the truth.

Smollett, 36, joined the cast of the Fox TV drama ""Empire"" in 2015, playing the role of Jamal Lyon, and gaining critical acclaim for his performance.

His IMDb.com profile shows that he began his acting career in 1991, when he had a small role in the TV movie ""A Little Piece of Heaven"" and later had a role in the 1992 film, ""The Mighty Ducks.""

He has also appeared on the sitcom ""The Mindy Project,"" as well as the 2017 film ""Alien: Covenant.""

Smollett released an album in March 2018 entitled ""Sum of My Music.""

Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, to a Jewish father and black mother. He graduated from Paramus Catholic High School in New Jersey.

He came out as gay in 2015 in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett has 1.38 million followers on Twitter and 5.3 million followers on Instagram.

On Jan. 27, two days before he reported the assault, Smollett posted a comment on Twitter that read: ""Frauds are everywhere y’all. Protect the mind, heart and spirit of you and your people at all costs. Just remember... Salt, cocaine and anthrax can all appear to be sugar...(the “refined” kind of course) just be careful out here fam. Happy Sunday. Love you. Real talk. Love on."""

Fake hate crime narrative finally comes to an unofficial end as the rope for the noose put around Jussie’s neck was traced to a hardware store in Chicago where the Osundairo brothers (Jussie’s “assailants”) purchased it. Now watch the story get memory holed in the national media in 5…4…3…2…1….

Another aspect of this story is just how bad an actor Smollett is. You get badly beaten up and don’t call 911 immediately but keep talking to your boss instead? You enter your apartment building right after the beating and walk right by a security desk without reporting the attack?

“Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request,” CBS News Chicago reported. “The sources also say the ‘Empire’ actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.”

Police arrested the two brothers on Wednesday “at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday,” the Associated Press reported. “They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.”

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony said. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Smollett had initially claimed that he was attacked in the early morning hours on January 29 while walking home. TMZ reported:

“Empire” star Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by 2 men who beat him up, put his head in a noose and screamed, “This is MAGA country.” Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We’re told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*****?” The 2 men – both white and wearing ski masks — viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, “This is MAGA country.”

Asa Cooper, 28, of Dorchester, is accused of shooting a man just after midnight Saturday morning outside a home on Highland Street in Woburn, Massachusetts.

Cooper is charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon causing injury, assault to murder with a firearm, discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling, possession of a firearm without a license, and illegal possession of ammunition.

Police say Cooper and the victim know each other and were fighting over a $10 debt when the argument quickly escalated.

Witnesses told police a group of people was standing outside of the home when they were approached by another group that included Cooper inside of a minivan.

The van had a logo with the business name “One Call” on the side and had a “school bus” sign on the roof.

The argument ensued over the $10 debt, and the victim was shot multiple times.

Police say upon arrival they found the victim, a 43-year-old Woburn man, suffering from two gunshot wounds to his legs. He was transported to a local hospital with injuries that are believed to be non-life-threatening.

The group in the minivan fled the scene after the shooting.

A short time later, Stoneham and Massachusetts State Police located the van on the on-ramp to Interstate 93 southbound in Woburn.

There were four people inside the van, including Cooper who was a passenger.

An investigation revealed Cooper was allegedly involved in the shooting and he was placed under arrest.

The other three people in the van were not arrested, but the van was seized as evidence and towed from the scene.

Authorities say no weapons have been recovered.

Cooper is being held pending his arraignment Tuesday in Woburn District Court. It’s unclear if he has an attorney.

The other three people in the van were not arrested, but the van was seized as evidence and towed from the scene.

Authorities say no weapons have been recovered.

Cooper is being held pending his arraignment Tuesday in Woburn District Court. It’s unclear if he has an attorney.

The shooting remains under investigation."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police have shifted the direction of their investigation into actor Jussie Smollett's report of a hate-crime assault and are seeking to interview him again, after releasing two men detained for questioning in the probe, a police spokesman said on Saturday.

Smollett, 36, an openly gay African-American performer who plays a gay character on the musical hip-hop TV drama ""Empire,"" ignited a furor on social media last month when he reported he had been attacked on the street by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

According to Smollett's account, his assailants struck him in the face, draped a rope around his neck and doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" before fleeing. Police said the actor took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt.

On Wednesday evening this week, police said they arrested two Nigerian brothers described as ""persons of interest"" who were recognized from surveillance camera footage taken in the area of the alleged Jan. 29 assault.

The pair were freed two days later without charge, police told Reuters on Friday, in light of ""new evidence"" from their interrogation.

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied a media report on Thursday that detectives were looking into whether Smollett had staged the attack, saying then that there was ""no evidence to say this is a hoax.""

On Saturday, Guglielmi issued a brief statement saying that ""information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He added, ""We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Attorneys for Smollett said in a statement late on Saturday that he was ""angered and devastated"" by recent reports that the alleged attackers were people he is familiar with, including a personal trainer he hired to prepare him for a music video.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" said the lawyers, Todd Pugh and Jonathan Brayman.

Smollett and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago police department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate, they said.

Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Smollett has also retained the services of criminal defense lawyer Michael Monico, a former Illinois federal prosecutor who is also representing President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.

Monico could immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.

""Empire"" debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show."

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his defense lawyers, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, told Deadline Saturday night. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

The attorneys went on to say that one of the men interviewed by police this week is a personal trainer who was ""hired to ready him physically for a music video.""

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,"" the attorneys said.

Smollett and his attorneys said they will continue to cooperate with the investigation.

""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,"" the statement concluded.

Smollett's attorneys released the statement after law enforcement sources told multiple media outlets that brothers Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo told police Smollett ""paid"" them to stage the alleged assault. They sources also said the brothers bought the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store in Chicago.

Sources told CBS Chicago the brothers bought the rope on Jan. 25. They told police they were paid $3,500 before they left for Nigeria and promised $500 after they returned to Chicago. They also told police they rehearsed the attack ""days"" before the attack and bought a red had at an Uptown beauty supply store.

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men in the early hours of Jan. 29, on his way back to his apartment. The actor said the men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured an unknown chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

Earlier in the week, there were rumors Smollett was being written off Empire, but 20th Century FOX said that was not the case. The studio has not commented on Saturday's developments yet.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" Smollett told Good Morning America when asked about rumors the attack was staged. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Famed actor and singer Jussie Smollett reported to Chicago police in January that two masked men attacked him while shouting racial and homophobic slurs.

Police arrested and detained two men. One was an extra in the sitcom ""Empire,"" in which Smollett stars.

Police believed the men detained were the same pair spotted in surveillance video the morning Smollett reported getting attacked.

The two men were released and police said they are no longer suspects in the case.

There are new allegations that Smollett fabricated the attack. Police aren't confirming, but authorities did say the case has shifted the investigation and that Smollett needs to return to Chicago for more questions.

They, however, told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax.“After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, confirming that the brothers are no longer suspects.One of the brothers, both of whom were detained on Wednesday, was an extra on Smollett’s television show.

After many days of twists and turns in the story of the alleged attack on the actor, sources in the Chicago police department told Deadline that they had shifted the investigation onto Smollett himself and believe the actor helped orchestrate the attack.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told the news outlet.

TMZ also reported that Smollett paid a pair of Nigerian brothers, friends who had initially been identified as suspects, to attack him on a cold night in January. Smollett initially claimed that he was beaten by two masked men who yelled “This is MAGA country!” in reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, then put a noose around his neck and poured a chemical on him.

Chicago police have not officially said that Smollett is a suspect in the incident, but it appears that the actor is lawyering up in preparation for a criminal defense. As the New York Post’s Page Six reported, Smollett hired the same criminal defense attorney used by Michael Cohen. The lawyer, Michael Monico, is a former federal prosecutor in Illinois’ Northern District, and confirmed this week that he had been hired to represent Smollett.

Monico represented Cohen on charges that he violated campaign finance laws with hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Donald Trump. Cohen ultimately pleaded guilty and will be sentenced later this month.

Chicago police this week had arrested two Nigerian brothers — Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — after identifying them as men seen on surveillance video near Smollett on the night he said the attack took place. The brothers were taken into custody, but were released without charges as police cited “new evidence” in the case. Later reports indicated that the men were friends with Jussie Smollett and worked out with him in the gym inside his luxury apartment complex.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said defense lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson in a statement obtained by Deadline.

Earlier Saturday, a law enforcement official close to the Chicago PD probe told Deadline that “the new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.” CNN also reported sources in the department telling the cable newser today that the actor, who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox drama, “paid two men to orchestrate the assault.”

This picks up on the release by authorities late last night of Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who police previously described as “potential suspects.” With one of the brothers having appeared on Empire as an extra three seasons ago, the remarks by Smollett’s lawyers now claim that one of the duo was the actor’s “personal trainer” for a music video he was set to perform in.

Arrested on Wednesday, but never charged in what police once referred to a potential “hate crime,” Osundairo brothers have been confirmed by authorities as the two individuals who are seen in the photographs of someone around Smollett’s Chicago apartment that January 29 morning.

Amidst strongly denied rumors that the attack was staged because Smollett was being written off Empire, the siblings are also said to have been the ones to purchase from a local hardware shop the rope that was strung over the actor’s neck by his supposed assailants during the allegedly racist and homophobic fueled attack.

Later this evening Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said “we can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He went on to add “we’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate,” asserted the statement from Henderson and Pugh tonight in direct response to accusations of self staging of the attack and more interaction with the Windy City cops.

Sitting down with Good Morning America on February 14 in his first interview since whatever truly happened on January 29, Smollett bluntly said he thought the attack occurred because of his consistent slagging of Donald Trump. “I come really, really hard against 45,” the actor told GMA co-host Robin Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

Well, be it Smollett, the Chicago PD, the lawyers, the Osundairo brothers or some as yet unknown party, the rising sentiment clearly is that someone’s not telling the whole story here. Or as Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Terry Crews put it so well on social media today:

This @JussieSmollett story is just… WHOA — terry crews (@terrycrews) February 17, 2019

After offering repeated support for Smollett the past three weeks, so far Empire broadcaster Fox has been silent the past 24 hours as the story seems to be snowballing out of control for all concerned.

CHICAGO — Chicago police say ""the trajectory of the investigation"" into the reported attack on Jussie Smollett has shifted and they want to conduct another interview with the ""Empire"" actor.

Chicago police late Friday released without charges two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

Police have been unable to find surveillance video of the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

“One of the purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to read him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement continued.

“Jussie and his attorney’s anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At present time, Jussie and his attorney’s have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channel,” they concluded.

CNN reported on Saturday, two Chicago police sources told them it appears he hired the two Nigerian brothers, who were arrested on Wednesday and then were released without charges on Friday, because of “new evidence” and their cooperation with police.

The comedian has come forward with some serious trolling and frustrations over the “Empire” star possibly staging his recent Chicago attack.

Rawlings lit up his Instagram feed Saturday (February 16) to slam Smollett amid reports claiming he played a key role in the alleged hoax.

Smollett has already lawyered up amid growing drama surrounding his Chi-Town attack.

Jussie Smollett has hired Michael Cohen’s criminal defense lawyer, the attorney confirmed this week, amid the deepening mystery of the “Empire” actor’s claim that he was the victim of a hate attack. “Yes, at the moment, I am,” Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in Illinois’ Northern District, told WGN’s “The Roe Conn Show” on Thursday. (Page Six)

Despite the speculation, police are not caving into reports suggesting Smollett might have staged the attack.

“Interrogations will resume today with the two individuals and their attorney,” department spokesman Anthony Guglielimi said in a statement to The Times on Friday. Guglielmi again denied reports alleging that the attack was a hoax and reiterated that Smollett is being treated as a victim. “While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” Guglielmi said. “The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.” (Los Angeles Times)

This week, reports emerged about Chi-Town police raiding the home of two persons of interest connected to Smollett’s attack.

Both men are Nigerian and were extras on “Empire.” Based on what the cops have already said, it appears these are the same men who were captured on the surveillance video. According to the report, police seized 5 bottles of bleach, a red hat, 2 laptops and other items. (TMZ)

Here’s a breakdown of how the investigation began and where it’s going.

The investigation into the alleged hate crime reported by Empire star Jussie Smollett last month has garnered national attention. And as many details emerge that are either incorrect or have yet to be confirmed, we felt it important to layout the timeline of events that led us here.

Here’s what is confirmed and where it's headed. We will be updating this as we report on the story:

January 29 (morning)

The actor files a report with Chicago police that he was the victim of a bias-motivated attack by two white men at 2 a.m. while walking home from a Subway restaurant.

Smollett tells officers who conducted his first interview at his home an hour after the incident that the men used racist and homophobic language, punched him, and poured bleach on his body. He also states that they put a rope around his neck, which was still present on him when police arrived at his home.

“This is MAGA country” was allegedly yelled during the incident.

The actor tells police that his manager was on the phone during the attack and could corroborate the incident. Smollett then transfers himself to an area hospital, where he was treated by medical providers and held overnight.

Chicago police put out a statement: “Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime.”

January 29 (afternoon)

Elected officials and celebrities begin to release statements of outrage at the crime and support of Smollett.

Many Democratic leaders immediately label the incident a hate crime, with Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker using it to highlight antilynching legislation they have introduced.

Major LGBTQ organizations also put out statements highlighting how the incident is connected to rising hate crimes in America that are often underreported.

January 30

Chicago police provide an update that states they’ve reviewed “hundreds” of hours of footage and were able to find Smollett walking downtown. However, no footage shows an attack.

Police release a blurry photo of two suspects who are named “persons of interest.”

Fox Studios confirms that hate mail had been sent to Smollett just one week before this attack that depicted a man being shot alongside hate speech. The FBI immediately launches an investigation into the mail.

No suspects have yet to be identified, and Smollett is still considered a victim by Chicago police.





January 31

President Donald Trump responds to the attack while being interviewed at the White House by the press corps. The president provides sympathy to the actor, stating: “It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned.”

Smollett’s family, which consists of well-known activists and actors, release a statement standing behind him.

February 1

Smollett breaks his silence and releases a statement saying, “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.” He emphasizes that the incident was bias-motivated and speaks on overarching violence LGBTQ people, specifically trans people, face regularly that doesn’t get discussed.

He also states that his accounts of the event are “100% factual.”

Police have not named any suspects in the attack and continue their investigation.

February 2

Smollett makes his first public appearance since the event at a pre-planned concert in West Hollywood. He uses the performance to make more statements about the attack and passionately refers to himself as the “gay Tupac”.

He also uses the stage to stress that he fought back against his attackers, who he identifies as white Trump supporters.

February 13

Chicago police arrest two Nigerian men at O’Hare International Airport after their return flight from Nigeria and bring them in for questioning. Their home on the north side of Chicago is searched and it becomes known that one of them worked on Empire.

February 14

Smollett's first media appearance is aired on Good Morning America, where he stands by his original story. He expresses anger at not being believed and says that naysayers ""don't even want to see the truth.""



Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker pass their bipatisan legislation in the Senate that aims to make lynching a federal hate crime. Smollet's story is used in statements before the vote.

Local reports begin to emerge that sources inside the police department believe these men helped coordinate the incident with Smollett. Chicago police immediately deny this information by calling it “unconfirmed.”

Reports also state that Smollett hired the men after finding out he was being written off Empire. Fox immediately denies the claim, stating he is integral to the show.

February 15

The two men being held by Chicago police are named suspects in the case and will be held in custody for interviewing. No charges are filed and they are released after producing new evidence in the investigation.

The Advocate confirms that Smollett does know the two men.

February 16

Sources inform media outlets that the new evidence produced is a receipt showing the purchase of the rope used in the attack. Police confirm that these men are the two subjects found in released screenshots of video surveillance from that night.

Smollett’s spokespeople confirm to The Advocate that the actor has retained high-profile defense attorneys who specialize in criminal investigations.

A Chicago police spokesperson says this new evidence has changed the “trajectory” of the investigation and they’ve requested to interview Smollett immediately.



February 16 (late night)

Jussie Smollett's camp releases a statement through his new criminal defense team that denies all reports that the actor coordinated the January attack.



“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his legal team writes. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

His camp finally confirms that the men did know Smollett and that one was a personal trainer he hired for a music video. They also state they are cooperating with police.



February 19 (morning)



The FBI and U.S. Postal Service expand their investigation into hate mail received by Smollett to include hjim as a suspect. The agencies would not confirm officially.



The actor has yet to meet with Chicago police for follow-up interviews after the release of two men who have produced evidence that changed the ""trajectory"" of the investigation.



Reports emerged Tuesday morning that Smollett's role in Empire is being reduced as production continues. His spokespeople would not comment on the reduction, but did state the actor has filmed many scenes already.



The Advocate can cofirm that one noteable plotline that was going to debut this season and our magazine was breifed on days before the attack has in fact been finished. But spokespeople couldn't confirm if it will air.



Chicago police announce they received a tip that Smollett was seen in his apartment building with the two brothers before the incident. They plan to interview the witness by end of day.



February 19 (evening)



Chicago police interview a potential witness and announce Smollett wasn't with brothers before the attack.



The brothers are seen at the Chicago courthouse where they met with prosecutors but do not give a comment when leaving the building. An hour after their departure, the top prosecutor in Chicago, State's Attorney Kim Foxx, recuses herself from the case before any charges are made.



The State's Attorney's office wouldn't elaborate on why.



February 20

Chicago police name Jussie Smollett as a suspect in the investigation into his reported hate-incident. After weeks of investigation, police announce they believe the actor filed false police reports.



A Grand Jury is empaneled and evidence is heard by police. The two brothers who say they witnessed the incident are interviewed for over two hours, according to their lawyer.



Charges against Smollett are approved by the State's Attorney's office and he is indicted by Wednesday night for disorderly conduct related to the filing. He now faces a Class 4 felony.



Detectives say they are negotiating his surrender by the morning. He will appear in court by 1:30pm local time on Thursday.



February 21

Jussie Smollett is arrested Friday morning after turning himself at a Chicago police station.

A press conference is held at police headquarters. The superintendent lambasted Jussie Smollett for filing false reports with the police and accused the actor of exploiting people believing victims of violence.

The agency states that Smollett was motivated to orchestrate that attack due to salary issues he was facing with Empire. Fox Studios wouldn’t confirm or deny any issues between themselves in the actor.

“We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,"" said in a statement after news broke. ""We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”



Backlash explodes against the actor across social media, including from President Donald Trump."

Unbelievable would be an understatement here, if what new reports suggest is true…

It is Saturday, February 16, and new reports are coming out, by outlets such as CNN, TMZ and Deadline, citing sources close to the investigation that suggest Jussie Smollett orchestrated his own attack.

Per CNN and TMZ, more evidence is coming to light that suggest the two persons of interest, who were arrested and later released as they’re said to be fully cooperating with law enforcement, had been paid and acting under Jussie’s lead. TMZ reports one of the brothers had given his phone to police, revealing a phone call between him and Jussie sometime before the alleged attack occurred.

And according to CNN‘s sources, the two brothers purchased the rope found around Jussie’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago. A source with USAToday claims they told police Jussie paid them to do it, as it’s also reported that CNN sources claim police do believe the Empire actor staged the assault that occurred on January 29 — an alleged act of violence involving a rope and a poured unknown chemical substance. It had been reported that “racial and homophobic” slurs were used during the attack.

In addition to the reporting mentioned above, a source also told Deadline:

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.”

And per The Hollywood Reporter, Chicago Police Department chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi seemed to address the reports Saturday evening, explaining in a statement:

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

As of this writing, representatives for the actor, Empire, and FOX have yet to address the latest developments.

It is important to note that the only real confirmation of anything here is that the investigation has shifted based on new information. What exactly that new information is has yet to be confirmed.

CHICAGO — Chicago police said Saturday they have reached out to the attorney for “Empire” star Jussie Smollett because they still want to speak to Smollett after releasing two brothers they had been questioning about a reported attack against the actor.

Twelve hours after calling them “possible suspects,” police late Friday released the brothers without filing any charges, citing “new evidence” they did not disclose.

“Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet.

Outside the South Side police station where the brothers were held for two days, their lawyer told reporters Friday night that “innocence prevailed” but was vague about why her clients were taken into custody and why they were released.

“My guys are walking home. They are not charged. They are not suspects in this case,” attorney Gloria Schmidt said.

Police sources have said detectives are investigating the possibility that Smollett had the brothers fake the attack around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in Streeterville. Schmidt has said the brothers have worked with Smollett on “Empire” and use the same gym. Smollett follows the brothers’ bodybuilding page on Instagram.

Pressed about speculation that Smollett set up the attack, Schmidt said, “There’s still a lot of moving parts to this. … I’m not part of Jussie’s defense. I’m not part of what’s going on with him. I can just tell you that my guys (are) innocent of the charge and they’re going home.”

Asked about the “new evidence” police mentioned, Schmidt said, “Obviously I had it. Obviously my clients had it. But I think it took a matter of coordination.” She would not say what that was.

Schmidt was unavailable for comment Saturday. Chicago criminal defense attorney Michael Monico, who is representing Smollett, declined to comment. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful.

The men were arrested Wednesday night after detectives tracked their movements on surveillance cameras in the Streeterville area, where Smollett says two men shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, hit him and wrapped a rope around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Smollett, in his first TV interview, said Thursday he believed the two people captured by those cameras are his attackers. “ ‘Cause … I was there,” he told “Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts. “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

Smollett, who was born in Santa Rosa and lived in Sonoma County as a young child, has told police the attack occurred as he was walking from a Subway sandwich shop to his apartment building. The brothers, who are in their 20s and are black, were tracked down through ride-share records, according to police sources.

The brothers are aspiring actors who have posted auditions online, including a scene in which each of them were interrogated by police for a murder. They signed with the Babes ‘N Beaus Model and Talent Agency in 2016, according to Don Underwood, one of the owners of the Hinsdale-based agency. They each appeared on an episode of NBC’s “Chicago P.D.” last year.

They had roles in the 2017 indie movie “The Worst Nightmare.” One of them also had a part in Spike Lee’s 2015 film “Chi-Raq.”

Neither brother has been credited for work on “Empire,” aired on the Fox network, though the older brother said in a 2015 interview that he played the prison bodyguard for Chris Rock’s character. Rock guest-starred on the Season 2 premiere of “Empire” in 2015.

A week before the attack, Smollett told police he received a threatening letter at work. Witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off the letter at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in southwest suburban Bedford Park on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters “MAGA” were written in the upper-left corner of the envelope.

Smollett said a stick figure was shown hanging from a tree with the words, “Smollett Jussie you will die black (expletive).”

“Did I make that up too?” Smollett asked in his interview with Roberts.

Police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are related, and so far they are being investigated separately — the letter by the FBI and the alleged attack by Chicago police.

Meanwhile, production on “Empire” is scheduled to continue next week with a Near West Side shoot, according to information posted in the city’s online film permit database. It’s unclear if Smollett will participate in that shoot. A Fox representative declined to discuss cast schedules."

According to the media house, this was confirmed by two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation who told CNN that “Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollet paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.”

Recall that the brothers were arrested Wednesday but released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.” And now, sources told CNN the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

The sources added that there are records that show that the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store in Chicago, and that there are other evidences which the police are currently working with.

And this has stirred heated reactions on social media. At the moment, Smollett has deactivated his Instagram comment section and had yet to respond to the update as at press time.

The brothers, Olabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, could not be reached for comment. Ms. Schmidt declined to comment Saturday on the reports but said the brothers had completed their cooperation with the police.

Smollett has rejected skepticism about his account that emerged on social media after he made his initial report to law enforcement.

In that account, Smollett, who is black and gay, said that in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, he was attacked by two masked men who made a reference to “Empire.” He also said that the attackers made a reference to “MAGA country,” an allusion to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” According to Smollett’s account, the men then tied a noose around his neck, poured a chemical substance on him and fled.

Investigators could not generate many leads on finding suspects. There was no surveillance footage of the attack in an area of the city that the police said was heavily covered with cameras. Days after Smollett first spoke to the police, the department released an image showing two men that they said were potential persons of interest; according to the police, those ended up being the two men they detained this week. That the men, who are of Nigerian descent, were acquaintances of Smollett, fueled further speculation about the circumstances of an assault.

A spokesman for Fox, the network on which “Empire” airs, declined to comment.

In an interview broadcast Thursday on “Good Morning America,” Smollett was adamant that his story was true. For weeks, law enforcement backed up his assertions, saying publicly that investigators had no reason to doubt his story."

On the day of the attack, Smollett's employers at 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying they were ""deeply saddened and outraged"" by the assault.

At the same time and in the following days, Smollett's colleagues, civil and gay rights leaders, legislators and President Donald Trump expressed support and outrage at the attack that the actor described."

It was obviously another in a long series of such claims, pretty much all of which turn out to be frauds. That was the case here, as most people always assumed.

The truth is finally coming out, as the Chicago police have patiently investigated Smollett’s story. First, though, let’s visit the liberal media’s uncritical reaction to Smollett’s transparent fabrication. Our friends at Grabien have an excellent compendium:

It turns out that the whole thing was a hoax. Smollett apparently paid two Nigerian brothers who were extras on Empire to fake the attack on him:

Empire star Jussie Smollett paid two men $3,500 to stage an assault against him which he later claimed was an attack motivated by racism and homophobia, investigators in Chicago now believe. The stunning turn of events has rapidly transformed the beloved actor who was once thought to be the victim of a heinous hate crime into a suspect in a criminal investigation. The two men involved in the alleged hoax are now fully cooperating with law enforcement, CNN is reporting on Saturday.

What a shock! Of course, no one who pays attention is surprised. It is another left-wing hoax, promoted by news outlets that probably knew better. But it’s all for the anti-Trump narrative, like so much of what we read in newspapers these days."

Chicago police reportedly want to re-question Empire star Jussie Smollett, after ‘new evidence’ has emerged.

Jussie reported an attack that took place in Chicago at the end of January to police and it had been treated as a ‘hate crime’, as the actor claims his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him during the ordeal.

Police have been treating Jussie as a victim so far in the investigation. He was questioned again over the attack last week and two suspects were arrested – two brothers – but released following questioning and without charging.

Variety reports that police have requested a follow-up interview with Jussie due to information they have recieved from the two men who were questioned.

One of the men is believed to have been an extra on Empire, while it’s claimed both know Jussie from the TV series.

A police spokesperson told the publication: ‘We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

‘We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.’

The brothers were released on Friday and are now cooperating with police. An attorney for the two men said they were released after giving key information to the police and claims they have ‘a story to tell’ when the ‘time is right’.

TMZ and CNN report that Jussie had ‘paid the brothers to orchestrate the attack’. Sources told TMZ one of the brothers gave police his phone which showed a call from Jussie in the ‘vicinity of the attack’, but before it took place.

A police spokesperson has said new information has ‘changed the trajectory of the investigation’ (Picture: Invision)

A law enforcement source has told Deadline: ‘The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr Smollet was an active participant in the incident.’

Metro.co.uk have contacted a representative for Jussie for comment.

Jussie’s lawyer has responded to such reports, telling TMZ: ‘As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

‘He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’

Jussie had previously said he was ‘pissed off’ over those doubting the attack and claims that he had ‘fabricated’ details of the incident.

Fox have stood by the star and branded claims he ‘staged the attack, to prevent him from being written off Empire’ as ‘patently ridiculous’.

Police had also previously ruled out that the attack was orchestrated.

A spokesperson issued a statement that read: ‘While we haven’t found any video documenting the alleged attack, there is no evidence to say that this is a hoax.

‘The alleged victim is being cooperative at this time and continues to be treated as a victim, not a suspect.’

Smollett has alleged that two men assaulted him, tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical on him, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs.

The Chicago Police Department is reportedly pivoting its investigation into an alleged attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett to focus on whether Smollett himself orchestrated the incident, multiple news outlets reported Saturday evening.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told INSIDER that investigators have requested another interview with Smollett in light of new information, and have been in touch with his attorney.

“There are some developments in the investigation and we are now interested in speaking to the Empire cast member again,” Guglielmi said. He added that he couldn’t confirm or deny the media reports suggesting Smollett’s attack was staged.

Smollett, 36, alleged that on January 29, two men assaulted him, tied a rope around his neck, poured an unknown chemical on him, and shouted racist and homophobic slurs, before running away.

But investigators now believe that Smollett may have paid two men to stage the attack, CNN and NBC News reported, citing sources familiar with the investigation.

Smollett’s attorneys released a statement to news outlets Saturday night, saying Smollett was being “further victimized” by accusations that he orchestrated the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

Chicago police had arrested two brothers as part of the investigation into the alleged assault on Wednesday, but released them without charges on Friday.

Guglielmi announced after the two men’s release that police received “new evidence” after interrogating them, and that detectives have “additional investigative work to complete.”

The brothers told detectives that they were paid by Smollett to stage the attack, and that they bought the rope at a hardware store, CBS News reported Saturday, citing a source close to the investigation.

As recently as Friday, the Chicago Police Department had maintained there was “no evidence to say that this is a hoax” and that Smollett “continues to be treated by police as a victim, not a suspect.”

Smollett has denied accusations that the assault was a hoax. He appeared this week on “Good Morning America,” saying he was hurt by those who doubted his allegations.

“It’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth – you don’t even want to see the truth,” he said.

On Saturday, however, Chicago Police confirmed that new evidence has “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” as various outlets reported that police suspect Smollett paid two black men to orchestrate the hate hoax.

The Empire actor claimed to have been attacked by two masked white men who tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach-scented liquid on him, and chanted, “This is MAGA country!” Smollett, who is openly gay, also claimed the attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him. The police statement confirmed growing suspicions about Smollett’s story as more evidence has come to light.

If indeed Smollett’s story is a hoax, and if police are on the verge of charging him with filing a false report, the liberals who defended his story will have to answer for themselves. Will they retract their statements about the trend of “hate” Smollett’s attack revealed?

Here are nine prominent liberal politicians and organizations that spread the Smollett story.

1. Nancy Pelosi

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the alleged attack “racist, homophobic,” and “an affront to our humanity.”

“The racist, homophobic attack on [Jussie Smollett] is an affront to our humanity,” Pelosi tweeted. “No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love. I pray that Jussie has a speedy recovery & that justice is served. May we all commit to ending this hate once & for all.”

https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1090439686504570885

2. Joe Biden

Former Vice President Joe Biden, a likely candidate for president in 2020, expressed solidarity with the Empire star and condemned the “homophobia and racism” in the alleged attack.

“What happened today to [Jussie Smollett] must never be tolerated in this country,” Biden tweeted. “We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM — Joe Biden (Text Join to 30330) (@JoeBiden) January 30, 2019

3. Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, praised Smollett and denounced the attack as an “attempted modern day lynching.”

Jussie Smollett “is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know,” Harris tweeted. “I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

4. Cory Booker

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), another 2020 presidential candidate, used Smollett’s story to push for federal legislation.

“The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe,” Booker tweeted. “To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime– I urge you to pay attention.”

5. The NAACP

Derrick Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), connected the alleged attack to President Donald Trump.

“The recent racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling. The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric,” Johnson said in a statement. “It is dangerous for any society to allow a tone of divisiveness and hatred to dominate the political discourse. As this rhetoric continues to bleed into our everyday lives, dangerous behavior will continue to place many law-abiding individuals at risk.”

As if that were not enough, the NAACP president compared Trump’s rhetoric to “terrorism.” He concluded, “We pray for a full physical and mental recovery Jussie Smollett and many unnamed victims of this forum of hate based terrorism.”

As more evidence that Smollett’s story may be a hate hoax came to light, Johnson condemned skeptical media reports. “It’s unfortunate, the media is verging on demonizing a victim,” the NAACP president told The Wrap.

6. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC)

Chad Griffin, president of the HRC, not only failed to question the Empire star’s story, but described the attack as part of a trend.

“This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,” Griffin said in a statement. “There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities — and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.”

Griffin used the story as an opportunity to push “state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes.” Indeed, according to FBI statistics, 1,130 of the 7,175 hate crimes in 2017 targeted people based on sexual orientation, and 119 targeted people for their gender identity.

These attacks are horrific, and the crimes reported to the FBI are less likely to be hoaxes. Yet by tying these incidents to Smollett’s story, Griffin may have detracted from their seriousness.

7. GLAAD

The LGBT activist group GLAAD said that it “stands with Jussie and against such hate violence.”

“Our hearts are with Jussie Smollett as he recovers from a hate-motivated and repugnant attack in Chicago,” GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. “Jussie has always used his voice and talent to create a better world, and it is disgusting that anyone, especially someone who has done such good for so many, would be targeted by undeniable hatred.”

“GLAAD condemns these despicable acts as well as the racism and homophobia that drove them,” Ellis added. Will she condemn the hoax just as vocally?

8. The ACLU

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also condemned the “racism and homophobia” behind the alleged attack on the Empire star.

“LGBTQ people of color live at multiple intersections of oppression, too often facing violence compounded by both racism and homophobia,” the ACLU tweeted. “This isn’t the America we want to live in. Our thoughts are with Jussie Smollett and all survivors.”

Does the ACLU still consider perpetrators of hate hoaxes “survivors”?

9. The SPLC

Last, but certainly not least, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) seized on the story, using it to bolster its list of “hate groups.”

“Hate crimes — especially against LGBTQ+ and black people — are increasing,” the SPLC tweeted, believing his story verbatim. “Actor Jussie Smollett, who is both black and gay, was attacked by two men who allegedly shouted, ‘This is MAGA country!’ after they beat him and put a rope around his neck.”

https://twitter.com/splcenter/status/1090973096415236097

Later, the SPLC used the story to prop up its own smear campaign.

“We track hate. In 2017 alone we counted 51 anti-LGBT groups in the US,” the far-Left smear group tweeted. “The violent attack on Jussie Smollett, albeit despicable, is not unique. POC & the LGBTQ community are most commonly targeted – especially those at the intersection of both identities.”

The SPLC’s “hate map,” which plots the organizations it brands “hate groups” on a list with the Ku Klux Klan, inspired a 2012 terrorist attack against the Family Research Council (FRC), a mainstream Christian group the SPLC marked an “anti-LGBT hate group.” Last year, the SPLC paid a settlement of $3.375 million to a Muslim reformer it falsely branded an “anti-Islamic extremist.” The group is currently facing multiple defamation lawsuits.

Each of these politicians and groups has a chance to reverse their statements on the Jussie Smollett hoax. Will they?

Chicago police had arrested two brothers as part of the investigation into the alleged assault on Wednesday, but released them without charges on Friday.

Guglielmi announced after the two men's release that police received ""new evidence"" after interrogating them, and that detectives have ""additional investigative work to complete.""

The brothers told detectives that they were paid by Smollett to stage the attack, and that they bought the rope at a hardware store, CBS News reported Saturday, citing a source close to the investigation.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

Authorities considered the two men “persons of interest” and detained them Wednesday night at Chicago O’Hare Airport. They released the men Friday night.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they released the men after detectives discovered new evidence upon their interrogation.

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the ‘Empire’ case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said in a tweet Friday evening.

Gloria Schmidt, an attorney representing the two men, who are brothers, said for her clients, “justice prevailed.”

“My guys are walking home,” Schmidt added. “They are not charged. They are not suspects in this case.”

Smollett, 35, was hospitalized Jan. 29 after he said two unknown men in Chicago attacked him while he was walking and shouted racial and homophobic slurs, police said.

The actor told police the offenders poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing the scene."

Chicago police had arrested, then released, the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett's lawyers also issued a statement Saturday, saying the actor would continue to co-operate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Smollett has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and, ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening, they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett's lawyers said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from California Sen. Kamala Harris and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett 'pissed' at skeptics

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in Los Angeles on Feb. 2, saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts, of ABC News, that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Law enforcement reached out to Smollett's lawyers during the past several hours, Chicago-based criminal defense attorneys Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh.

The investigation into the alleged assault on Empire star Jussie Smollett has possibly taken an unexpected turn on Saturday, with CNN reporting that two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation have informed the news organization that Chicago Police believe Smollett orchestrated his attack.

On Wednesday, two brothers with alleged connections to the FOX series were arrested on suspicion but were releaed on Friday without charges. Although sources told CNN that Chicago Police have records of the brothers having purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a Chicago Ace Hardware store, law enforcement officials cited the discovery of ""new evidence"" as the reason for the release. CNN is also reporting from sources that Chicago Police believe the two men may have been paid by Smollett to commit the assualt, or were directly involved in arranging the attack with Smollett; and that both men are cooperating fully with authorities.

Smollett alleged to authorities that he was the victim of an attack on January 29 by the two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,"" who proceeded to pour ""an unknown chemical substance"" on him and put a rope around Smollett's neck before fleeing the scene.

On Thursday, ABC's Good Morning America aired an interview with Smollett where the actor/singer went into detail about the assualt and what life has been like for him since that time. Speaking with interviewer/GMA co-host Robin Roberts, Smollett had this to say when asked about allegation being made that the attack was a hoax:

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country.""

Smollett's representative and attorney have not issued a response to CNN's reporting at the time of this posting.

Portraying the character of Jamal Lyon on FOX's long-running and popular prime-time drama since its premiere, the award-winning actor/singer was in Chicago the weekend of the alleged attack to prepare for a concert he was set to perform."

While walking alone in downtown Chicago, he was approached by two men who were yelling racist and homophobic slurs. They then assaulted him, threw an unknown substance in his face, and put a rope around his neck before running off. Not only is Smollett a black man who is openly gay, but he’s also played a gay character on Empire since 2015. It was originally believed that the suspects had recognized the actor from the show and targeted him due to his sexuality. However, now law enforcement has reason to believe that Smollett could have actually hired the men to attack him, orchestrating the entire thing. Why? Perhaps, to start a larger discussion on racism and homophobia, according to CNN. Still, Smollett is holding true to his story and fighting these claims against him.

After the alleged attack, Smollett was reportedly rushed to the hospital where he was evaluated by physicians. Miraculously, he was mostly uninjured. The actor claims he’s been cooperating with law enforcement since the beginning, but they’ve been hesitant to believe his story. The Chicago Police Department has already addressed their doubts, saying that the actor will potentially face charges if it turns out that he gave a false report. Now law enforcement sources from the department are saying they have reason to believe Smollett could have fabricated the entire thing.

The day after the incident, police noticed two men on surveillance footage that fit the description Smollett gave of the pair that attacked him. This past Wednesday, both of those men were arrested. However, they weren’t even in custody for a week, before being released on Friday due to new evidence. Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that the investigation is now going in a different direction. “Detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” he said. He also mentioned that one of the suspects had worked on Empire in the past, though it’s not yet been revealed what his role was.

Smollett has been outspoken in his frustration over not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

There were originally rumors that stated the men who attacked Smollett had been wearing MAGA hats. This is a claim that the actor has adamantly refuted. “I never said that… I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae,” he said."

A source close to the investigation told CBS News that the brothers said they were paid by Smollett to carry out the alleged attack, and bought the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a nearby hardware store and have evidence of the sale.

CNN reported the same information from two of its own sources close to the investigation.

All sources said the brothers, identified by police as Ola and Abel Osundairo, are now co-operating with the investigation.

Ola Osundairo has appeared on Empire as a prisoner in season two of the show, and one of the brothers is Smollett’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help him get physically ready for a music video, Smollett’s attorney’s said in a statement.

He also played a concert in West Hollywood, California on February 2, in which he gave an emotional speech and said he had to play the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

The Jussie Smollett story of a racial attack was too politically convenient to be true. And as with investments, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

We have covered several dozen hoaxes, including The Great Oberlin College Racism Hoax of 2013. The Jussie Smollett story had all the indications of a hoax, of seeming too politically convenient and useful to be true.

The alleged crime took place in late January, when two white men in #MAGA hats attacked the gay black actor, call him racist and homophobic slurs, punched him while saying “this is MAGA country,” threw bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck.

How “convenient” a story in the age of Trump Derangement Syndrome. The political convenience was shown with the overwhelming liberal condemnation not only of the attack but of Trumpism, even though the facts were suspicious from the start. Follow these threads for a sampling of screenshots about the alleged crime by Hollywood and liberal political elites:

But there were facts that made it seem, from the start, less than probable: MAGA supporters in Chicago carrying bleach? In the middle of the night randomly finding a high profile black actor to attack? In the middle of the Polar Vortex of below zero temperatures? And why a noose? I understand the imagery, but the likelihood?

As in all these potential hoaxes, we exercised caution as police searched, in vain, for video footage of the crime. Another suspicious absence in a city flooded with security cameras. When two men were finally identified, they turned out to be black Nigerians who had some relationship to Smollett.

Now it appears to be completely falling apart for Smollett. The Nigerians, initially arrested, have been released and are cooperating with police. Multiple national and local news sources are reporting that their police sources are telling them the Nigerians have confessed to purchasing the hats and the rope for Smollett and at his cost, in order to stage the attack.

CBS2 in Chicago reports:

Two brothers who were questioned and released by Chicago police investigating the Jussie Smollett attack did play a role in the crime. Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. The sources say plain red hats worn by the brothers were bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29…. The brothers are now cooperating with police. Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

CNN reports:

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN that Chicago Police believe actor Jussie Smollet paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him that he reported late last month.

Is it “possible” Smollett did not set up this hoax. Yes, but it’s as likely as two white guys running around Chicago in the middle of a Polar Vortex wearing MAGA hats while carrying bleach and a noose.

Attorneys for Jussie Smollett say there is no truth to reports that the ""Empire"" actor played a role in a reported assault on him last month by what he described as two men shouting homophobic and racial slurs.

In a statement late Saturday the lawyers say: ""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" His lawyers say that Smollett will continue to cooperate with a Chicago police investigation into the reported attack.



The lawyers' statement came after police said Saturday the investigation into the attack has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview Smollett.



Police released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked early Jan. 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.



Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett said he was cooperating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire"", James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Police released grainy images of two people they said were in the area at the time of the reported attack and said they wanted to question them.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the Nigerian brothers — one of whom they said worked on ""Empire""— at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

And then on Saturday, Guglielmi said the investigation had shifted."

After the better part of a weekend in which the Chicago Police Department was publicly careful about pushing back against news reports suggesting it was investigating the racist and homophobic attack against Empire actor Jussie Smollett last month as a hoax, the dam has apparently begun to break. CNN reports tonight that “two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation” have now told them that the CPD believes the attack was staged, while an official spokesperson has issued a statement saying that recent witness interviews have “shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” and that they’re seeking to speak to Smollett once again.

Said interviews were with two men, reported to be brothers, that CPD picked up for questioning on Thursday after they’d been identified in surveillance footage from around the time and location of the attack. (One of them had also reportedly appeared on the Fox music drama, presumably as an extra.) Police released the two men today without charging either of them, noting that they’d cooperated with the investigation. The same unnamed sources that spoke to CNN about the wider direction of the investigation also said that the department had found evidence that the two men were the ones who’d purchased the rope placed around Smollett’s neck during the attack from a nearby hardware store.

According to Smollett, he was attacked on the night of January 29 by two men who apparently recognized him from Empire; he says they spouted racial slurs, placed a rope around his neck, poured an unknown fluid on him, and physically attacked him. His manager confirmed that he’d been on the phone with the actor and musician, who’s black and openly gay, during the time of the attack. Smollett went to the hospital that morning, and was quickly released.

Smollett gave an interview about the incident on Good Morning, America on Thursday morning, expressing his frustration at those who don’t believe it actually happened. (Meanwhile, he hasn’t commented on any of the developments that have taken place in the case over the last few days.) The CPD has yet to offer a motive as to why Smollett might stage an attack against himself; previous speculation that he was afraid of being written off of Empire has been firmly refuted by Fox, the show’s writers, and producer Danny Strong. Meanwhile, faking an incident like this will only make it more difficult for victims of hate crimes to be believed when they really do occur, an injection of lethal doubt that could carry an uncountable human toll; it’s not clear why Smollett would want that to be the case.

Update: Smollett’s attorneys have now issued a statement, vigorously denying the CPD’s (as yet unofficial) charges:



As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels."

The day after two suspects were released without charges due to new evidence in the attack on Jussie Smollett, police reportedly are investigating whether the Empire star was an “active participant” in the assault against him.

On Saturday afternoon, multiple media outlets cited Chicago police sources in reporting that the 36-year-old actor is now suspected of paying the two brothers who were involved in the alleged racial and homophobic attack against him that took place on Jan. 29.

In a statement to EW, Chicago PD said, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Hours later, Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, provided a statement to EW: “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Earlier on Saturday, a law enforcement source reportedly told Deadline Hollywood, “The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.” TMZ, which originally reported that the two men previously arrested were brothers and Empire extras Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, says the duo “completely cooperated” with police and one of their phones showed a call between them and Smollett not long before the incident.

In his first interview since the alleged attack, Smollett explained to Good Morning America why he didn’t turn over his phone to police. “They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours,” he said, noting sensitive information like “private pictures” and his partner’s number. “I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna do that.” He added, “I don’t know what that’s gonna be to hand over my phone. And, honestly, by then inaccurate, false statements had already been put out there.”

Just over two weeks ago, Smollett, who is gay and plays a gay character on Empire, was walking to get food in Chicago, where the series films, when he says two unknown offenders approached him, yelling racial and homophobic slurs. They then attacked him, he claims, pouring an unknown chemical substance on him and even wrapping a rope around his neck. The offenders fled the scene, while Smollett transported himself to Northwestern Hospital.

Friday night, police said they released the two men who had been questioned in the case without charge, and police said they are no longer considered suspects. Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi said when the men were released that it was ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement.

20th Century Fox Television said it had no comment or statement at this time.

The police source familiar with the investigation said that the men released, who are brothers, have agreed to fully cooperate with police. The source also said that the brothers were found to have purchased the rope at a hardware store.

An attorney who represents the two men did not return a request for comment Saturday.

The attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told reporters Friday night when they were released without charge that ""innocence prevailed"" and that ""they're not charged, they are not suspects in this case."" She said then that ""there was a lot of information that was shared, from the police, from us.""

Asked about the new evidence cited by police in releasing the pair, she said Friday: ""New evidence that was brought to their attention — obviously I had it, obviously my clients had it, but I think it took a matter of coordination."" She did not elaborate on what the evidence was.

Some social media users began to cast doubt on Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

Police also had said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records for the investigation. The actor had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. Police have said, however, that Smollett was cooperating with the investigation, and later gave investigators a PDF file with partial phone records.

In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett said he was upset that some people questioned whether the attack occurred.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,'"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.'""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" he said."

CHICAGO — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

That’s the question people have been asking for weeks, and now, it seems we may be closer to getting an answer.

According to CNN, two credible sources tied to law enforcement have come forward to confirm that Chicago Police believe the actor paid two men to assault him.

To further substantiate that claim is the fact that authorities say, “the trajectory of the investigation” into the reported attack had shifted and they wanted to conduct yet another interview with Smollett.

Late Friday, police released two Nigerian brothers they had detained for questioning earlier in the week, without charges. And the sources have told CNN that’s because the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago : “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

The person, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, said police are attempting to interview Smollett again, so they can question him about the brothers' account.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said.

Smollett, who is black and gay, said he was attacked while walking home through Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood late last month. He told police masked men tied a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and yelled the slurs and “MAGA country!”

Police also found records in the Chicago home of one of the men that showed they purchased rope from a hardware store that was used in the alleged attack, the source told USA TODAY.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. “We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Police had questioned the two brothers, who are of Nigerian descent and have long lived in Chicago, earlier this week after taking them into custody at O'Hare International Airport upon returning from international travel. They initially classified the brothers as suspects in the Jan. 29 attack on Smollett.

Late Friday, the men were released from custody without charges. Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago police's chief spokesman, cited ""new evidence” as the reason for the men's release.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,"" the statement said.

Earlier this week, Chicago’s ABC affiliate reported that investigators believed that Smollett staged the attack, because he was being written off the show.

FOX Entertainment and 20th Century FOX Television, which produces the Chicago-based family drama, pushed back against the notion that Smollett was being written off the show.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,” the statement said.

Since launching the investigation, police consistently described Smollett as a victim of an attack.

Asked by USA TODAY Saturday if investigators still believe Smollett was a victim of an attack, Guglielmi stopped short of categorizing how investigators currently view the actor.

""We have some new information that we would like to corroborate,"" he said.

Smollett said in an interview Thursday with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that those doubting him ""don't even want to see this is the truth.""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would’ve supported me a lot more, and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now,” he said.

Police: Aurora attacker used gun he shouldn't have owned

AURORA, Ill. -- The man who opened fire and killed five co-workers including the plant manager, human resources manager and an intern working his first day at a suburban Chicago manufacturing warehouse, took a gun he wasn't supposed to have to a job he was about to lose.

Right after learning Friday that he was being fired from his job of 15 years at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Gary Martin pulled out a gun and began shooting, killing the three people in the room with him and two others just outside and wounding a sixth employee, police said Saturday.

Martin shot and wounded five of the first officers to get to the scene, including one who didn't even make it inside the sprawling warehouse in Aurora, Illinois, a city of 200,000 about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.

After that flurry of shots and with officers from throughout the region streaming in to help, he ran off and hid in the back of the building, where officers found him about an hour later and killed him during an exchange of gunfire, police said.

""He was probably waiting for us to get to him there,"" Aurora police Lt. Rick Robertson said. ""It was just a very short gunfight and it was over, so he was basically in the back waiting for us and fired upon us and our officers fired.""

Aurora shooting victims ranged from intern to plant manager

CHICAGO -- The victims of a disgruntled employee who opened fire at a suburban Chicago industrial warehouse were co-workers ranging from an intern to the plant manager. A look at the victims:

TREVOR WEHNER

The 21-year-old Northern Illinois University student was on his first day as an intern in human resources at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora and attended the fateful meeting where the gunman was fired and then started shooting.

Jay Wehner said his nephew grew up about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Aurora in Sheridan and was expected to graduate from Northern Illinois University in May with a degree in human resource management. He was on the dean's list at NIU's business college.

""He always, always was happy,"" Jay Wehner said. ""I have no bad words for him. He was a wonderful person. You can't say anything but nice things about him.""

Chicago police: Jussie Smollett assault case has 'shifted'

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the ""Empire"" actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday.

State Department: Nauert out as pick for UN ambassador

WASHINGTON -- Heather Nauert, picked by President Donald Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations but never officially nominated, has withdrawn from consideration, the State Department said.

Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a department statement that ""the past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name from consideration.""

Nauert's impending nomination had been considered a tough sell in the Senate, where she would have faced tough questions about her relative lack of foreign policy experience, according to congressional aides.

A potential issue involving a nanny that she and her husband had employed may also have been a factor in her decision to withdraw, according to one aide. That issue, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Saturday, centered on a foreign nanny who was legally in the U.S. but did not have legal status to work, according to the aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The aide said some involved in the vetting process saw Nauert's inexperience and questions about her ability to represent the U.S. at the U.N. as a larger issue.

Potential privacy lapse found in Americans' 2010 census data

WASHINGTON -- An internal team at the Census Bureau found that basic personal information collected from more than 100 million Americans during the 2010 head count could be reconstructed from obscured data, but with lots of mistakes, a top agency official disclosed Saturday.

The age, gender, location, race and ethnicity for 138 million people were potentially vulnerable. So far, however, only internal hacking teams have discovered such details at possible risk, and no outside groups are known to have grabbed data intended to remain private for 72 years, chief scientist John Abowd told a scientific conference.

The Census Bureau is now scrapping its old data shielding technique for a state-of-the-art method that Abowd claimed is far better than Google's or Apple's.

Some former agency chiefs fear the potential privacy problem will add to the worries that people will avoid answering or lie on the once-every-10-year survey because of the Trump administration's attempt to add a much-debated citizenship question.

The Supreme Court on Friday announced that it would rule on that proposed question, which has been criticized for being political and not properly tested in the field. The census count is hugely important, helping with the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and distribution of billions of dollars in federal money.

Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick for sex abuse

VATICAN CITY -- Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been found guilty by the Vatican of sex abuse and defrocked, as calls rose Saturday for Pope Francis to reveal what he knew about the once-powerful American prelate's apparently decades-long predatory sexual behavior.

The announcement Saturday, delivered in uncharacteristically blunt language for the Vatican, meant that the 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., becomes the highest-ranking churchman and the first cardinal to be punished by dismissal from the clerical state, or laicization.

He was notified Friday of the decision, which was upheld upon his appeal and approved by Pope Francis.

The pontiff next week leads a summit of bishops from around the world who have been summoned to Rome help him grapple with the entrenched problems of clerical sex abuse and the systematic cover-ups by the Catholic church's hierarchy.

Decades of revelations about priests who have sexually preyed on minors and their bosses who shuffled abusive clergy from parish to parish instead of removing them from access to children have shaken the faith of many Catholics. They also threaten the moral authority of Francis and even the survival of his papacy.

Storm-lashed South Carolina reassesses global warming's role

COLUMBIA, S.C. -- When he took the job 15 years ago, Horry County Emergency Manager Randy Webster figured his biggest disasters would be wind and surge rolling over his county's beaches, South Carolina's top tourist destination.

Instead, his worries have shifted inland, where rivers overflowing their banks have caused two massive floods in three years.

""We're getting into this sort of unknown territory,"" Webster said. ""We typically in emergency management have some point of reference to work with. Two floods like this - it's unheard of.""

Scientists say the Earth's warming climate means more heavy rainfall over short periods of time, and that translates to larger, more ferocious storms on the scale of 2017's Hurricane Harvey in Texas or 2018's Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Florence dumped six months' worth of rain on the Carolinas in the course of just a few days.

The growing realization that such events are going to become more common as the result of global warming is forcing Webster and other state officials to revisit how they prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

Dem presidential candidates introducing themselves to voters

Five Democratic senators vying for their party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 fanned out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters.

Kamala Harris of California spent her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who met with an estimated 800 voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia - an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York both focused on New Hampshire. Booker made his first visit to there since joining the race earlier this month, holding a question-and-answer session with more than 400 voters in Portsmouth.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, meanwhile, made her own uncommon choice for early campaigning by visiting Wisconsin before heading to Iowa, home to the nation's first caucus.

And a Democratic heavyweight who's yet to address his 2020 plans, former Vice President Joe Biden, made his own high-profile appearance at the Munich Security Conference.

Gone in a New York minute: How the Amazon deal fell apart

NEW YORK -- In early November, word began to leak that Amazon was serious about choosing New York to build a giant new campus. The city was eager to lure the company and its thousands of high-paying tech jobs, offering billions in tax incentives and lighting the Empire State Building in Amazon orange.

Even Governor Andrew Cuomo got in on the action: ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" he joked at the time.

Then Amazon made it official: It chose the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to build a $2.5 billion campus that could house 25,000 workers, in addition to new offices planned for northern Virginia. Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats who have been political adversaries for years, trumpeted the decision as a major coup after edging out more than 230 other proposals.

But what they didn't expect was the protests, the hostile public hearings and the disparaging tweets that would come in the next three months, eventually leading to Amazon's dramatic Valentine's Day breakup with New York.

Immediately after Amazon's Nov. 12 announcement, criticism started to pour in. The deal included $1.5 billion in special tax breaks and grants for the company, but a closer look at the total package revealed it to be worth at least $2.8 billion. Some of the same politicians who had signed a letter to woo Amazon were now balking at the tax incentives.

John Collins: Favorite dunker is Hawks teammate Vince Carter

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- John Collins has a favorite dunker. Not surprisingly, it's his Atlanta teammate Vince Carter.

Collins will represent the Hawks in the dunk contest, one of the events during All-Star Saturday Night. The 3-point contest and skills competition are also on the evening docket.

Collins had perhaps the best dunk of the Rising Stars game Friday night, going with a pass off the backboard to himself for a slam over Dallas' Luka Doncic. He says he's got three or four dunks ready to go for Saturday night.

He won't reveal what to expect: ""No hints,"" he said Saturday morning.

CHICAGO -- Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the ""Empire"" actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett's attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett's attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The investigation into the assault on Empire actor Jussie Smollett took another twist on Saturday night. Chicago police apparently now believe Smollett paid two men to stage the attack, according to CNN. Reached for comment about the report, a Chicago police spokesman would only confirm that “the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.” He added that police have “reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

On Friday, news broke that two brothers were arrested in connection with the attack, one of whom worked on Empire. Chicago’s ABC7 had reported on Thursday that police believed Smollett staged his attack because he was being written off the show, but police later denied they were treating Smollett as a suspect, and 20th Century Fox denied that Smollett was being written off.

According to Deadline, the two men were released at 9 p.m. on Friday after being held for 48 hours. A law enforcement source also told the publication that “the new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident.”

Police have also reportedly gotten a lead on where the brothers purchased the rope used as a makeshift noose around Smollett’s neck:

NEW: Sources say at least one of the brothers purchased the rope used in Jussie Smollett incident at Crafty Beaver hardware store the weekend of Jan 25th.

Smollett went on Good Morning America Thursday, detailing the attack and expressing frustration that people did not believe his story. “At first, it was a thing of, like, ‘Listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s it. Because it’s the truth,’ ” he said. “Then it became a thing of, like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’ ” Smollett has hired three attorneys: Chicago criminal defense attorneys Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh, and Michael Monico — Michael Cohen’s defense attorney. Monico confirmed his retention by Smollett on The Roe Conn Show, but would not say in what capacity.

Representatives for 20th Century Fox Television, which produces Empire, declined to comment, but Deadline obtained a statement from Smollett’s lawyers. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” said Pugh and Henderson. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. The statement also confirmed that one of the men arrested Thursday was Smollett’s personal trainer.

Update, February 19: CBS has obtained new details about Smollett’s reported role in his own attack after speaking to the two brothers accused of helping him orchestrate the whole thing. The brothers reportedly told detectives that they and Smollett rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening and that Smollett paid them $3,500 to carry out the attack, plus an additional $500. According to a source, the rope used as a noose in the alleged attack was purchased at a local hardware store at Smollett’s request and he paid for it. The brothers released a joint statement via their lawyer saying, “We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump. We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.” Their lawyer added, “In due course all the facts will reveal themselves, and at the end of the day, my clients are honest and credible.”

According to CBS, Smollett faked the attack because he was upset at 20th Century Fox’s lackluster response to a threatening letter containing white powder that he’d received a week prior to the alleged attack. “When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,” the source said. A magazine potentially used to create the letter was seized from the brothers’ home; that letter is currently being investigated by the FBI."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement reads:

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.

""Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of this investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.""

CNN reports that, according to two Chicago police sources, police now believe ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was not attacked as he described, but paid two men ""to orchestrate the assault.""

The men, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who had been identified from surveillance video at the scene, were arrested Wednesday and held by police for two days. They were never charged. CNN's sources say that records show the brothers bought rope allegedly used in the attack at a Chicago-area hardware store, and that the attack ""was supposed to happen before"" January 29.

CBS Chicago reports that the brothers were paid $3,500 for their part in the orchestrated attack. They left for Nigeria the night it happened, and were reportedly supposed to receive another $500 upon their return.

Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi told ""Extra"" Saturday, ""After we spoke to the former suspects [Friday] night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett's attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again.""

He also told ""Extra,"" ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the 'Empire' case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the 'Empire' cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett told police he was attacked January 29 around 2:00 a.m. outside his Chicago apartment building by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, leaving him with a rope around his neck. He told ""Good Morning America's"" Robin Roberts in an interview that aired Thursday he was ""pissed off"" about the attack, addressing doubts that have been raised about his version of events.

In the interview, he said, “It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth.' Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.'”

The Advocate has confirmed that Smollett has retained the services of criminal defense attorneys Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. Smollett's team would not elaborate to the magazine why he was hiring criminal defense attorneys."

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I’ve heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I’m not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That’s ridiculous. And it’s offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

In an email to HuffPost, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that the attorney for the “Empire” actor had been contacted with a request for a follow-up interview.



“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” he said.



Two Nigerian brothers arrested on suspicion of assaulting Smollett ― one of whom had been hired by Smollett as a personal trainer ― were released by Chicago police late Friday without charges.



No further details about the investigation have been given by the police.



Citing two anonymous law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation, CNN reports that police believe the actor may have paid the two brothers to orchestrate the attack.

John Palmer/MediaPunch/IPx Chicago police confirmed that the trajectory of their investigation into the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett has “shifted.""

Last week, Chicago police reported that Smollett had been attacked by two unidentified masked men in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The alleged assailants were also believed to have doused the actor in what was likely bleach before wrapping a rope around his neck.



According to police, Smollett was reportedly walking to get food around 2 a.m. when the alleged attackers approached him and began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” Smollett, who is black and gay, told authorities that the perps yelled “MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.



Smollett’s attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson released a statement to ABC News late Saturday in which they said Smollett was “angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.”

“He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement read. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

It continued: “One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,” the statement read.

The 36-year-old actor previously said he was ﻿“pissed off” that some people had questioned his story.

“At first it was a thing of like, ’Listen, if at first I tell the truth, then that’s it, ‘cause it’s the truth.’ Then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, how can you doubt that? How do you not believe that? It’s the truth,’” he said in an interview with “Good Morning America” last Thursday. “And then it became a thing of like, ‘Oh, it’s not necessarily that you don’t believe that this is the truth, you don’t even want to see the truth.’”

This story has been updated with comments from Smollett’s attorneys."

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case, and attorneys for the “Empire” actor blasted reports alleging he played a role in his own attack.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett’s attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt “victimized” by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,” the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett’s personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett’s attorneys said.

The brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were questioned on Wednesday and released without charges Friday. Both men had been friendly with Smollett, sometimes working out with him, and Olabinjo had appeared on Empire as an extra in 2015.

Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday evening, “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Michael Monico, a defense attorney representing Smollett, did not return The Daily Beast’s request for comment Saturday evening.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Saturday evening that the two men are now cooperating fully, and that there are records showing they bought rope at a hardware store in Chicago prior to the attack. CBS reported that the brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and promised $500 more on their return.

Smollett said he was attacked in Chicago on Jan. 29 by men who placed a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him. In a Good Morning America interview on Feb. 14, he denied reports that the men wore “Make America Great Again” hats, but characterized the incident as racist and homophobic.

“They called me a f****t, they called me a n****r,” Smollett said in the interview. “There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on some racist sundae.”

Questions about the incident have swirled since it was first reported. Smollett had been cooperative in police interviews, but there was no footage of the alleged attack. He said he had been on the phone with his manager, who also said he heard the men shout homophobic slurs.

Smollett initially refused to turn over his phone records from that night. Then, 13 days after the assault, gave investigators a PDF file containing a redacted list of his calls, according to police spokesman Guglielmi. Those records confirmed the call with his manager.

ABC7 reported on Thursday that “multiple sources” said that the alleged attack was being investigated as a hoax, with Smollett potentially arranging it because he was being written off Empire. Chicago Police officially denied that story later the same day.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi tweeted. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Fox, the network that airs Empire, also denied that story.

“The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment told Deadline. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”"

The Chicago Police department’s investigation into the alleged racist and homophobic attack on entertainer Jussie Smollett has shifted from identifying potential assailants to focusing on the Empire star himself—as police now reportedly believe Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault.

According to CNN, the two men, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested Wednesday but were released without charges Friday after Chicago police revealed the discovery of “new evidence.” The two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Chicago detectives are now investigating the lead that the Osundairo brothers, one of whom previously appeared on “Empire” in 2015 as an extra, purchased the rope that was found around Smollett’s neck after his alleged attack at the hands of two men who assaulted him while spewing racist and homophobic slurs.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told Deadline Saturday.

Additionally, lawyers representing Smollett were contacted by law enforcement on Saturday, who issued a formal request for the actor to resubmit to questions by detectives. In preparation for doing so, the 36-year-old actor retained attorneys Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh, two Chicago-based lawyers who specialize in criminal defense.

Updated: Sunday, February 17, 2019, 10:27 a.m. EST:

Attorneys for “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett issued a statement Saturday denying his involvement in orchestrating his Jan. 29 assault, while noting that he is both “angered” and “devastated” by the recent developments in the case.

The following is the statement in full, courtesy of Variety:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

Smollett informed law enforcement that on January 29 that he was attacked by two white men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, poured a chemical on him, and strung a noose around his neck.

Two Nigerian brothers 25-year-old Abel and 27-year-old Ola Osundairo, who worked as extras on the Fox television series “Empire,” were arrested on February 13 and released on the 15th without being charged. The brothers cooperated with law enforcement and informed them they had purchased the rope used as a noose at a Chicago Ace Hardware store. They also confirmed they were the men on the surveillance video found by police the evening of the attack.

CBS News reported police raided the home of the brothers on February 13 and found electronic devices, bleach, shoes, and a red hat.

TMZ reported that the brothers were pro LGBT, opposed Donald Trump and were supporters of Barack Obama.

Police verified that the phone records obtained showed Smollett was speaking on the phone with his music manager, Brandon Moore, at the time of the attack. Both claimed the alleged attackers yelled “MAGA country.”

In an interview with “Good Morning America” on February 14, Smollett discussed the details regarding his attack. He told the interviewer he was frustrated that people were questioning him. Smollett said during the interview:

It feels like if I had said it was a Mexican or a Muslim or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.

According to Fox News, On February 15, source report police seized a bottle of bleach they found in Smollett’s apartment.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told CNN that the police had contacted Smollett’s attorney on to set up a meeting. Smollett hired Michael Cohen’s criminal defense lawyer, Michael Monico.

Smollett initially said he did not know who attacked him. It was reported he was friends with the brothers and would often talk to them on the set about fitness and health. Also, the actor follows both brothers on social media. On the brothers’ Instagram account which is shared, there is a video showing them working out at a private gym located on Smollett’s block.

Smollett told ABC News on February 13 that he would never be the same person. He added the experience had changed him forever.

The investigation into the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett keeps getting weirder and weirder. Now, Smollett has hired a lawyer and not just anyone. He retained Michael Monico, the criminal defense lawyer best known for representing Michael Cohen.

Why would Smollett need a criminal lawyer in a case where he has accused two men of attacking him? Questions keep pouring in about the investigation.

Jussie Smollett attack suspects released

On Thursday, while appearing on Good Morning America, Jussie Smollett confirmed that the men seen on surveillance video were definitely his attackers, saying, “I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them. Never did.”

On Friday, the two men who had previously been pegged as suspicious persons on surveillance footage new Jussie Smollett’s Chicago apartment were taken in for questioning.

It turned out that the two men were Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo who had appeared on Empire previously as extras.

Later on Friday, the brothers were released from custody after police claimed new evidence exonerated the two men. Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told TMZ that her clients were released after sharing information they had with police.



When asked if the Jussie Smollett attack was staged, Schmidt declined to answer, saying only that she didn’t want to speculate.

Jussie Smollett hires lawyer Michael Monico

The arrest and release of the Nigerian brothers who also appeared on Empire set off a wave of theories about the alleged Jussie Smollett attack that were only made worse upon learning that he hired a criminal lawyer.

It was learned on Thursday that Jussie Smollett hired lawyer Michael Monico, who previously represented Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen.

Monico revealed his new role during an appearance on The Roe Conn Show. However, he didn’t reveal how long he had been working for Smollett or why.

What we do know is that investigators are still piecing together what happened to Jussie Smollett on January 29 and should release those details soon. As for the Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel, their lawyer claims that they were on the scene that night and would tell their story “when the time is right.”"

Police arrested the men, who are brothers from Nigeria, on Wednesday but released them Friday after discovering ""new evidence.""

A Chicago police spokesman said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation."" He added that police wanted to speak to Smollett again.

When news of the ""attack"" broke last month, Democratic presidential contenders clamored to denounce it as a horrific manifestation of racism and bigotry in America.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called it a “modern-day lynching.”



The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.

Asked about the incident, President Trump also condemned it, saying “it’s horrible,” and “It doesn’t get worse.”

Smollett said his attackers were white and that his story would not have been doubted if an attacker had been ""a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black."" He stated that they had punched and kicked him, abused him with homophobic epithets and shouted: ""This is MAGA country."""

The two were picked up by police at Chicago O’Hare Airport as they arrived back in America after visiting family in Nigeria to be questioned over the January 29 attack involving the star.

Their family say they went to Africa on January 29, hours after the Smollett attack. One of the suspects, Ola appeared on Empire in 2015 and both brothers have had minor roles on Chicago PD.

Smollett follows their joint Instagram account and, according to their lawyer, sometimes goes to the gym with them.

Findings have also uncovered photographs of one of the brothers inside the gym in Smollett’s apartment building in June. The gym is private to residents of the luxury condominium building.

However, the star has been accused by anonymous police sources cited by local networks of staging the attack.

The sources accused Smollett of orchestrating the assault because he was being written out of the show and wanted to drum up publicity to save his role – a claim that has been strenuously denied by the show and uncorroborated by the police department.

Smollett had told the police that he was attacked by two assailants whose facial features he could not make out but that it was a racist, homophobic ambush during which they called him ‘Empire f****t n****r’ and shouted: ‘This is MAGA country!’

Meanwhile, the two men have been released without charge, according to police announcement late on Friday.

They are reportedly being released due to ‘new evidence’.

Two brothers were arrested Wednesday and released without charges after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.” Sources told CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement and that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

Smollett gave his first detailed account of what he says was a hate crime against him, and the aftermath, in an interview with Good Morning America on Thursday. In the interview he expressed his frustration at not being believed.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.“

Comedian Dave Chappelle joked about Smollett in a show on Friday and said that he had planned the attack in order to remain on Empire.

UPDATE: Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement to CNN Saturday night saying Smollett was angry about these latest developments,

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.” At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.“

Following the brothers' arrest on Wednesday, the police department reportedly discovered ""new evidence"" that allowed for their release on Friday.

Jussie Smollett told police that on Jan. 29 he was attacked by two unidentified men who put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on his face. The alleged attackers were reportedly yelling racial and homophobic slurs while they were assaulting him.

The former suspects, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were released 48 hours after their initial arrest. The two brothers are reportedly friends of Smollett's and have worked with him as extras on the Fox series Empire, in addition to going to the same gym. “There’s still a lot of moving parts to this. … I’m not part of Jussie’s defense. I’m not part of what’s going on with him. I can just tell you that my guys (are) innocent of the charge and they’re going home,"" their attorney Gloria Schmidt explained.

In a statement to Deadline, a source close to the investigation said that the focus has now pivoted towards Smollett as the potential orchestrator. “The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” they reported.

After Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo's release, Defense attorney Michael Monico told Variety that he was representing Smollett. However, on Saturday, Smollett's representatives denied Monico's statement.

In response to speculation regarding Smollett's potential exit from Empire, Fox refuted that producers had ever considered writing him off the show.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The brothers, who were arrested Wednesday, were released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.” The sources told CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Why, it was only a few weeks back when we were reading stuff like this, from Joe Berkowitz writing in Fast Company:

The recent Covington High School incident proved to be a political Rorshach test. You might have seen sneering twits in MAGA hats taunting an elder Native American, or perhaps you saw patriotic youngsters framed by a media too eager to torment U.S. president Donald Trump and his supporters. Even as the dramatic final days of the longest government shutdown in history wore on, the national conversation coalesced around who was at fault in that viral moment–and what had actually happened. One heated point of contention around the issue, though, is what message the students’ MAGA hats inherently conveyed: innocent support for the president, or something more malevolent. Both sides-ing media outlets like Politico rushed into the fray to defend MAGA hats, while Alyssa Milano incurred a backlash for denouncing them as the new “white hoods.” Partly missing from this conversation were the cold hard facts about how many violent acts have been committed in the name of Trump’s movement. On Tuesday morning, there was a devastating reminder. Actor Jussie Smollett, best known for his role on Empire, was reportedly beaten, taunted with homophobic and racial slurs, doused with bleach, and assaulted with a noose-like rope around the neck by two white men in ski masks, who told him, “This is MAGA country.”

UPDATE: Chicago PD now confirms Jussie told them about the attackers yelling, “This is MAGA country.” https://t.co/rYU06TekTm — TMZ (@TMZ) January 30, 2019

https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js

Let’s remember that the media took the Native American “elder” Nathan Phillips’s lies (see here and here) about the Covington Catholic boys seriously. It confirmed their biases about white males who wear MAGA hats.

In Jussie Smollett’s case, the claim that two people in Chicago would have attacked this guy at 2 a.m. on a subzero night with a rope, yelling “This is MAGA country!” ought to have set off people’s b.s. detectors.

The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.

The racist, homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett is an affront to our humanity. No one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love.

In the Washington Post in the immediate aftermath of the Smollett attack, Eugene Scott, who covers identity politics, wrote:

Smollett’s experience is far too common for black gay men, particularly those who speak out against racism and sexism. As activist Preston Mitchum wrote: “Everyday our multiple marginalized identities increase our chances of facing racist, homophobic vitriol — and this fact has only intensified under the Trump administration with their dog whistle politics. So as we wait to see if justice is served for Smollett, we as Black queer people wait to see if America will finally see our lives as worth protecting. Because history has rarely been on the side of Black queer folk.”

Why, Donald Trump himself might as well have been on the streets of Chicago, beating up poor Jussie. Lesbian actress Ellen Page went on national television and, in an emotional tirade (starts below at the 7:00 mark), blamed Mike Pence for what happened to Jussie Smollett:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec12JKkrhOo]

So now, will she apologize for her smear? Please. When it comes to hate crime hoaxes, the Reichstag fire is eternal.

At this point, you’d have to be an idiot to believe any of these claims until and unless there is clear proof. Don’t forget that Smollett went on Good Morning America the other day to whine about people not believing him. He said:

“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate. And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.” … “I could only go off of their words. I mean, who says, “f—– ‘Empire’ n—–,” “This is MAGA country, n—–,” ties a noose around your neck, and pours bleach on you? And this is just a friendly fight? It’s unbelievable to me that anything of this has come to this. That every single thing that I have done, every single thing that I have cooperated with, somehow has gotten twisted into being some bull that it’s not.”

Last month Smollett reported to police that he was attacked in the early morning hours of January 29, when two men approached him and attacked him on the street in Chicago near his home telling yelling “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett said the men also slipped a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance onto him while calling him racial and homophobic slurs, which prompted a hate crime investigation by local law enforcement. Chicago police took two men into custody on Wednesday but they were released Friday evening. CNN reports the two men, who are brothers, and at least one of whom reportedly worked on Empire as an extra, are now fully cooperating with law enforcement.

The brothers’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, says they have provided evidence to Chicago PD to corroborate that Smollett was involved in purchasing the rope, ​according to CBS. New details published Saturday by CBS News say the men were paid $3,500 by Smollett to stage the attack, which they had rehearsed days prior. After the attack, the brothers fled for Nigeria and returned days later. They say Smollett was supposed to pay them an additional $500 upon their return, CBS reports.

A spokesperson for the department told CBS after the bothers were released that the detectives on the case “have additional investigative work to complete.” The Advocate reports that Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys to represent him in light of allegations that the attack may have been coordinated. According to a spokesperson for Smollett, one of the brothers was Smollett's personal trainer, and therefore, ""it is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

The details of the attack spurred immediate support from many notable celebrities and politicians. Reporter April Ryan asked Donald Trump about the attack, since the reference to “MAGA country” was related to his “Make America Great Again” campaign. Trump said in January that the attack was “horrible. It doesn’t get worse as far as I'm concerned.”

In part, because of the ""MAGA"" claim, the story of the attack also brought on doubt from others. Earlier this week, Smollett responded through a spokesperson to rumors that he may have been lying about the attack in a statement saying that he “is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

In fact, one rumor was that Smollett staged the attack because he was going to be written off the show, but 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment debunked those rumors in a statement to Deadline. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,"" the statement reads. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Also this week, Smollett spoke to Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts to give his account of the attack and to address rumors that the assault was fabricated. ""It's not that you don't believe this is the truth,” he said,” you don't even want to see this is the truth.""

Meanwhile, a Chicago CBS affiliate reported that Smollett paid two brothers to stage an attack against him, directed them to buy items used in the alleged assault and actually rehearsed it with them.

At least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in the Ravenswood neighborhood the weekend of Jan. 25.

The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return. They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29, after the attack.

Sources told CBS that one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.

Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs."" He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.

CNN said its sources said that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

Chicago police, meanwhile, only would say the investigation into the assault reported by Jussie Smollett has ""shifted"" due to information received from two brothers questioned in the case.

Chicago police had arrested, then released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the attack.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

Smollett's attorneys later Saturday issued a statement saying the actor would continue to cooperate with police, but felt ""victimized"" by reports that he might have been involved in the attack.

""Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying,"" the statement from attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson said..

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was physically attacked by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and ""This is MAGA country!"" He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the brothers at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as ""suspects"" in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

One of the men is Smollett's personal trainer who he hired to get him physically ready for a music video, the statement from Smollett's attorneys said.

""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California , on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was ""pissed"" at people who did not believe he was attacked.

""I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,"" he said. ""I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.""

Earlier this week, police said reports that the attack against Smollett was a hoax are unconfirmed ..

Producers of the Fox television drama have supported Smollett, saying his character on ""Empire,"" James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation."

Smollett’s attorneys denied any suggestion that the actor was complicit. They said Smollett is the victim of a hate crime and that he has been cooperative with police.

""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,"" the attorneys said.

Smollett filed a report with the Chicago Police Department on Jan. 29 stating that two masked men hurled racist and homophobic slurs before beating him. The actor also said his attackers poured what he thought was bleach over him and put a noose around his neck.

The police department had said it was investigating the alleged attack as a possible hate crime. Smollett is black and gay.

Friday night, police said they released the two men who had been questioned in the case without charge, and police said they are no longer considered suspects. Chicago police spokesman Guglielmi said when the men were released that it was ""due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations.""

""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in a statement.

20th Century Fox Television said it had no comment or statement at this time.

The police source familiar with the investigation said that the men released, who are brothers, have agreed to fully cooperate with police. The source also said that the brothers were found to have purchased the rope at a hardware store.

An attorney who represents the two men did not return a request for comment Saturday.

The attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told reporters Friday night when they were released without charge that ""innocence prevailed"" and that ""they're not charged, they are not suspects in this case."" She said then that ""there was a lot of information that was shared, from the police, from us.""

Asked about the new evidence cited by police in releasing the pair, she said Friday: ""New evidence that was brought to their attention — obviously I had it, obviously my clients had it, but I think it took a matter of coordination."" She did not elaborate on what the evidence was.

Some social media users began to cast doubt on Smollett's claims after police said they were not able to find footage of the alleged attack after going through a voluminous amount of recordings from the many surveillance cameras in the area.

Police also had said Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records for the investigation. The actor had told police he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. Police have said, however, that Smollett was cooperating with the investigation, and later gave investigators a PDF file with partial phone records.

In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett said he was upset that some people questioned whether the attack occurred.

""It's like, you know, at first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, 'cause it's the truth,'"" Smollett said. ""Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you — how do you not believe that? It's the truth.'""

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, and that says a lot about the place we are in our country right now,"" he said."

The sources say the brothers claimed they were paid by Smollett. The brothers’ attorney said both knew Smollett.

Fox 32 News has also learned that police found a receipt for the rope found on Smollett’s neck in the brothers’ possession showing they had purchased it from an Ace Hardware in Chicago.

The two brothers were released by the police once they agreed to cooperate with police, after detectives said they would charge them with battery. Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Gugliemi confirmed detectives have reached out to Smollett’s attorneys and expressed that they need to talk with Smollett.

Police are now investigating whether Smollett made up the story but police are still calling him a victim at this point.

The attorneys for Smollett responded to the report with the following statement:

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.

“Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”"

Empire actor Jussie Smollett details his alleged attack by two men who he says put a 'rope around my neck' in TV interview

The actor, 36, was even said to have paid for the rope that was used in the alleged assault – with police sources claiming it was rehearsed days before, according to CBS.

Brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, who worked as extras on Empire, are understood to have told detectives that Smollett orchestrated the attack.

The brothers have now been released without charge.

A spokesperson for Smollett's lawyers said: ""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Smollett has hit back at the hoax claims, saying he feels “angered and devastated”.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from his lawyers read.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'I AM NOT LYING'

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, pointed out that one of the brothers was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Ravenswood, at Smollett’s request, according to CBS.

EMPIRE STAR 'PAID FOR ROPE FOR NOOSE'

It has been claimed that the Empire actor paid for the rope.

The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid £2,714 ($3,500) before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

They left for Nigeria later in the day on January 29, hours after the attack.

Documents reportedly prove that one of the Osundairo brothers bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck in Chicago.

The brothers were arrested on Wednesday but were released on Friday without charge after police said new evidence emerged during their interrogations.

Police are now “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

'RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK'

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Jussie, 36, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

He told how he was punched and kicked by masked attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor said he was battered, doused in acid and had a noose put around his neck by the men, who also called him a “f***ot”.

He previously denied claims that he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Cops initially said the Osundairo brothers were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has hit back at claims that the attack was faked.

SMOLLETT DENIES FAKING ATTACK

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

Smollett, however, issued a statement through his attorneys that said he has “no plans” to meet with Chicago police on Monday.

“Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” the statement continued. “Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf.”

Smollett has claimed that two men attacked him at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. The Chicago Police Department has consistently said that it was treating him as a victim, but that appears to have changed in the last 24 hours.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

On Saturday, Guglielmi reaffirmed that the police department was seeking to re-interview Smollett.

“While we are not in a position to confirm, deny or comment on the validity of what’s been unofficially released, there are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident,” the Chicago police said in a statement posted to Twitter.

Investigators arrested two Nigerian brothers on Wednesday night, and held them for questioning for two days. One of the men worked as an extra on “Empire,” and both know Smollett from the show, according to their attorney.

According to local media reports, the brothers were confronted with evidence that they had purchased the rope at an Ace hardware store. The brothers were released late on Friday, and are now cooperating with police.

CNN reported on Saturday that police believe that Smollett paid the two men to attack him. The network cited two unnamed law enforcement sources.

Smollett’s reps have called previous reports that the attacked was staged “ridiculous.” Fox has also stood by the actor. His reps did not respond to request for comment."

More and more details surrounding Jussie Smollett’s brutal attack are starting to unravel.

TMZ reports that sources claim that the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested and subsequently released were acting on Jussie’s behalf and were reportedly paid off.

Both brothers previously worked on the “Empire” set and are said to have “completely cooperated” with Chicago police during their investigation. One of them even turned over his phone and it shows a call between him and Jussie prior to the time of the “attack.”

CNN also reports that the brothers allegedly bought the rope that was placed around Jussie’s neck at an Ace Hardware store. The reports also claim that the police say Jussie paid the brothers to orchestrate the whole thing.

As we reported, Chicago police released Abel and Ola after “new evidence” was gathered from their investigation. They added that they were no longer suspects and further information would be released to the public at a later date.

Many have been speculating that certain parts of Jussie’s ordeal were fabricated as he described the attackers to be white Trump supporters, not black.

As Deadline reported, the investigation into the attack has shifted toward a focus on Smollett himself.

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told the news outlet.

TMZ also reported that Smollett paid a pair of Nigerian brothers to attack him.

Chicago police have not officially said that Smollett is a suspect in the incident, and have said that they continue to treat him as a victim of the attack.

Smollett suffered cuts and bruises from the attack in January, when he claimed two masked men beat him while shouting racist slurs and putting a noose around his neck. Police were able to locate two men seen on surveillance video near Smollett that night and arrested them this week, but released them without charges.

On Saturday, police announced that the two men — Nigerian brothers Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — were actually friends with Smollett and worked out with them in the gym in his luxury apartment building.

“The two suspects released yesterday were in fact on the scene and in the surveillance image,” said Chicago police spokeswoman Jessica Rocco, via the New York Post.

There have been reports that Jussie Smollett was in on the planning of a fake attack to keep him from being written off Empire, but this was later denied both by Chicago police and by the producers of Empire. Smollett appeared on Good Morning America this week to push back against reports that the attack was staged, saying that he believes people doubted him because he is black and openly gay.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” said Smollett.

Chicago police said the two brothers were also extras on Empire.

According to the Deadline report, Jussie Smollett has hired two famed Chicago lawyers who specialize in criminal defense, Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh. The actor’s lawyers said that he continues to cooperate with police on the attack and they have been contacted by police asking for Smollett to resubmit to questioning by detectives."

Detectives have asked to speak with Smollett again after receiving “new information” from questioning the men. The brothers were released from custody Friday night without charges.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi issued a statement Saturday night that said in its entirety: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi would neither confirm nor deny the information the law enforcement source provided to the Sun-Times.

The two men were taken into custody by police Wednesday night at O’Hare Airport after returning from a trip to Nigeria, their attorney Gloria Schmidt told reporters Friday.

The request to interview Smollett was made by detectives through Smollett’s attorneys late Friday night, but detectives had not heard back as of Saturday evening, according to Guglielmi.

“We would like to speak with him to corroborate the new information we received as a result of the interrogations,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett was “angered and devastated” by reports that the two men questioned last week were people he was familiar with, according to a statement sent Saturday by his attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson.

“[Smollett] has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack,” the statement read. “Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Pugh and Henderson identified one of the men released Friday as Smollett’s personal trainer and said, “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”

Smollett’s attorneys said Smollett would continue to cooperate with the investigation but declined to respond to statements made by “unnamed” sources inside the investigation.

The brothers, whose names have not been released by police but have been reported by several gossip sites, were questioned by detectives over two days.

After the men’s release Friday, police said they were no longer considered suspects.

Schmidt confirmed the brothers worked with Smollett on “Empire” and said they would eventually “tell their story.”

Asked by reporters Friday if Smollett had “set up” the attack, Schmidt demurred, saying there were “still a lot of moving parts to this” and “I’m not part of Jussie’s defense.”

Smollett has told police he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 when two men walked up to him, yelled racial and homophobic slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — possibly bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck. The incident has been investigated as a hate crime.

The actor said he was reluctant to call police immediately after the attack because of the attention it would receive. Smollett’s manager, who said he was on the phone with the actor at the time of the assault, called authorities 40 minutes later.

On Thursday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that police were investigating the possibility that the attack was staged. At that time, police repeatedly said Smollett was cooperating and was considered a victim.

When the two brothers were taken into custody, detectives believed they were the same men shown in a surveillance image released by police days after the purported attack, Guglielmi said at the time.

Smollett himself denied allegations that the attack was a hoax in an interview broadcast Thursday with anchor Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” and said the attacks on his credibility have been hard to take. He called allegations he was lying “ridiculous.”

The FBI is also investigating a letter sent to Fox and “Empire” offices on Jan. 22 that contained a white, powdery substance and “threatening language” toward Smollett.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett details his alleged attack by two men who he says put a 'rope around my neck' in TV interview

The actor, 36, was even said to have paid for the rope that was used in the alleged assault – with police sources claiming it was rehearsed days before, according to CBS.

Brothers Abimbola 'Abel' and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, who worked as extras on Empire, are understood to have told detectives that Smollett orchestrated the attack.

The brothers have now been released without charge.

A spokesperson for Smollett's lawyers said: ""There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today.

“Smollett’s attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Smollett has hit back at the hoax claims, saying he feels “angered and devastated”.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” a statement from his lawyers read.

“He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'I AM NOT LYING'

“Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, pointed out that one of the brothers was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.

“It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement said.

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Ravenswood, at Smollett’s request, according to CBS.

EMPIRE STAR 'PAID FOR ROPE FOR NOOSE'

It has been claimed that the Empire actor paid for the rope.

The brothers, who were questioned by police this week before being released, were paid £2,714 ($3,500) before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

They left for Nigeria later in the day on January 29, hours after the attack.

Documents reportedly prove that one of the Osundairo brothers bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck in Chicago.

The brothers were arrested on Wednesday but were released on Friday without charge after police said new evidence emerged during their interrogations.

Police are now “eager to speak to Jussie Smollett” in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CBS Chicago: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.

'RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK'

""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Jussie, 36, who is black and gay and who plays gay character Jamal Lyon in Empire, claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

He told how he was punched and kicked by masked attackers shouting ""This is MAGA country"" (Make America Great Again) in the early hours of January 29.

The actor said he was battered, doused in acid and had a noose put around his neck by the men, who also called him a “f***ot”.

He previously denied claims that he faked the Chicago attack because he was being written out of Empire.

Cops initially said the Osundairo brothers were persons of interest after they were recognised from CCTV footage in the area where Smollett said two men jumped him at 2am.

After the Nigerian brothers were arrested, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, told CBS News they were not involved in the attack.

In the wake of the assault, Jussie has hit back at claims that the attack was faked.

SMOLLETT DENIES FAKING ATTACK

Speaking out about the hoax claims, Jussie said: ""I'm p***ed off. It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks.""

Holding back tears, he said:""Like, you know, at first it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth then that's it because it's the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It's the truth.

""Then it became a thing of, like, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth. You don't even want to see the truth.""

The performer went back to work two weeks ago for the first time since two masked men attacked him and put a rope around his neck in Chicago, USA, in January.

The Chicago Sun Times reported that he told the crowd at the Troubador in West Hollywood: ""The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK.""

""I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.""

However, his phone records were rejected by police for being heavily redacted’ in the investigation into his brutal racist attack.

TMZ reported that the PDF file the 35-year-old star submitted could have been ""manipulated"" - claiming that numbers may have been added or deleted - although police told the publication that there is no evidence that the file had been altered.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, told Entertainment Weekly: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.

'He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.'

'It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.'

The stunning turn of events saw the two men involved in the alleged hoax now fully cooperating with law enforcement, CNN reported Saturday.

On January 29, two men 'yelled out racial and homophobic slurs' while attacking Smollett, the actor told police.

One of the assailants tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him, Smollett claimed at the time.

THE FULL STATEMENT FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S ATTORNEYS Lawyers Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson issued the following statement on Jussie's behalf on Saturday night: 'As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack.

'Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.' Advertisement

During the attack, the assailants yelled 'Empire f****t' and 'Empire n*****,' the actor has long maintained.

That narrative, however, is now under serious scrutiny by investigators, who reportedly have evidence that Smollett directed his 'attackers' to buy the rope used in the 'assault' at a local hardware store.

Documents prove two Nigerian brothers who work as extras on the highly rated Fox drama bought the rope which was found around Smollett’s neck at Crafty Beaver Hardware Store in Chicago.

The brothers made the purchase on the weekend of January 25.

They also bought two red plain hats that they wore during the alleged attack, according to sources close to the investigation.

Police believe that the red hats were purchased at a local beauty supply store in the Uptown section of Chicago.

'We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,' Chicago Police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.

'We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.'

Chicago police are now ‘eager to speak to Jussie Smollett’ in light of the new information that was uncovered, according to ABC News.

‘We have been in touch with Smollett's attorneys,’ a Chicago Police Department spokesperson said.

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE Here is what we know so far about the alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett and the ongoing investigation by the Chicago Police Department. Since CPD is not commenting citing the ongoing probe, the public has been left to rely on Smollett’s version of events. On January 29, Smollett was allegedly assaulted by two men at around 2am. Reports indicated that he was allegedly beaten up and had a noose tied around his neck. The alleged assault took place as Smollett was on his way home after buying a sandwich at a local Subway. Initial reports indicated that the attackers were ‘white men’ who yelled ‘This is MAGA country’ while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and pouring bleach on him. But during an interview with Robin Roberts of ABC’s Good Morning America, Smollett denied that his assailants wore red MAGA hats. Smollett also told Roberts that contrary to reports, his ribs were not broken as a result of the incident. After the assault, some began to wonder if Smollett concocted the entire story. That there were those who doubted Smollett stems from a number of factors. A Chicago Police spokesperson said on the day after the alleged attack that investigators were unable to find evidence of an assault. The only surveillance camera at the scene was pointed in the opposite direction. Smollett also phoned the police from his apartment rather than from the scene. When Smollett initially refused investigators’ request to hand over his phone, this raised eyebrows. Smollett then handed over his phone records, but they were redacted in order to protect the privacy of people not involved in the attack. On Friday, police arrested two Nigerian men in the connection with the attack - only to have them released later. Since both men are black, this has led some to be suspicious of Smollett’s claim that this was a hate crime. Information emerged later on showing that Smollett knew the two men who were arrested since they were extras on Empire. A theory floating around on social media stated that Smollett staged the attack because his character was being written off Empire. But the show’s producers and writers quickly refuted that claim. Source: Slate

Scene: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... but I was not hospitalized,' said Smollett (map with inset of the scene where the attack occurred just outside Smollett's apartment)

Chicago PD confirmed on Thursday that the pair seen in this image from surveillance footage around the time of the attack on January 29 (above) were Abel and Ola Osundairo

‘We made our intentions clear,’ he said.

Brothers Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo, 25, were cut loose from police custody late on Friday. They had been held since Wednesday, after being picked up at O'Hare Airport while disembarking a flight from Nigeria.

The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised another $500 upon returning, according to WBBM-TV.

Earlier on Saturday, Smollett hired Michael Cohen's high-powered criminal defense attorney, as the police investigation into the attack he reported last month took a sudden shift amid allegations of a hoax.

Attorney Michael Monico, a former federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois, revealed in a radio interview on Thursday in Chicago that he is representing Smollett.

Monico, speaking on WGN's The Roe Conn Show, did not reveal how long he has been representing Smollet or in what capacity. Monico last month took over as co-counsel for Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer.

It came as police in Chicago suddenly released the two Nigerian extras on Smollett's show, who had previously been described as suspects in the attack, saying that 'new evidence' had emerged in their interrogations that requires further detective work.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT COULD GET 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FILING A FALSE REPORT TO POLICE Mitchell Dutz, 18, was sentenced to three years in Illinois state prison for fabricating claims that three black men stole a car with a 13-month-old infant inside Filing a false report to police in the State of Illinois is considered an act of disorderly conduct, which is a Class 4 felony. That means that anyone found guilty could face between one and three years in prison. By law, the crime of disorderly conduct is committed in Illinois by anyone who 'transmits or causes to be transmitted in any manner to any peace officer, public officer or public employee a report to the effect that an offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed, knowing at the time of the transmission that there is no reasonable ground for believing that the offense will be committed, is being committed, or has been committed.' Last week, a central Illinois man was sentenced to three years in state prison after he pleaded guilty to fabricating an Amber alert. On December 15, Mitchell Dutz, 18, told police that three black men stole his car with a 13-month-old infant inside. Dutz used a social media photo of a child he did not know to claim that there was a kidnapping, according to Peoria Journal Star. But police rescinded the Amber alert after it became clear that it was a hoax. Dutz pleaded guilty to motor-vehicle burglary and disorderly conduct. Last month, a Chicago woman was charged with a felony after she allegedly made a 911 call that turned out to be a 'swatting' incident. Keesha S. Ingram, 41, allegedly called police before dawn on December 11 to report that a man was threatening to shoot his wife in their home in Warren Township. Sheriff's deputies responded to the call. They arrived at the scene and set up a perimeter around the house. Illinois police have issued an arrest warrant for Keesha S. Ingram, 41, who has been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly calling police and fabricating claims that a man was threatening to shoot his wife After making contact with the residents inside, the deputies determined there was no incident to warrant an arrest, according to the Daily Herald. Authorities then determined that they were dealing with a 'swatting' incident whereby a person falsely reports an ongoing crime at a particular address in order to harass the individual who lives there. An investigation led back to Ingram, who is alleged to have known one of the people who lived in the Warren Township home. Investigators believe Ingram made the swatting call out of revenge against the victim, whom she accused of not paying her money that was owed to her. Ingram is still on the loose and is wanted for arrest, according to Patch.

'Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,' Guglielmi said in a statement on Friday night.

The Osundairo brothers' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, spoke briefly to reporters after their release, hinting that Smollett's legal future could hold difficulties.

'There's so many moving parts to this that will come out in time,' Schmidt said when asked if her clients had helped Smollett stage the attack. 'I'm going to let them tell their story when the time is right.'

Smollett made international headlines after reporting the attack on January 29, in which he said two men assaulted him at 2am on a Chicago street, shouting vile racist and homophobic slurs.

Michael Monico (above) revealed in a radio interview on Thursday that he is Smollett's lawyer

The actor said that he fought back bravely as the two men shouted 'this is MAGA country,' poured bleach on him, and looped a noose around his neck.

Smollett has vigorously denied speculation that details of the attack were fabricated or staged, speaking out in an interview that aired on Wednesday just hours before the Osundairo brothers were detained.

It is unclear at this time what the Osundairo brothers told police that would alter the course of the investigation.

'The left is mentally insane': Trump supporters say they are vindicated since 'Jussie is a liar and a fraud' As Jussie Smollett is now suspected by authorities of fabricating claims he was beaten by two men alleged to have been Trump supporters, the president’s backers said on Saturday that they are vindicated. The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted: ‘It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story.’ Journalist Michael Tracey tweeted: ‘Popular culture and political media have been so relentless in their promotion of alarmist Trump-era narratives that all critical faculties go out the window when it comes to ""hate"" incidents that align suspiciously closely with everything pundits, celebs, etc. want to believe.’ Brian Flood tweeted: ‘CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news... but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters.’ ‘There was never any real attack,’ according to Ryan Fournier. Donald Trump Jr tweeted: ‘It appears that Jussie Smollett tried to manufacture a hate crime to make Trump supporters look bad and most of the media not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story’ Journalist Michael Tracey blamed 'alarmist Trump-era narratives' created by 'popular culture and political media' which has led to 'all critical faculties go[ing] out the window' Brian Flood tweeted: ‘CNN is all in on the Jussie Smollett news... but they keep forgetting the part where he claimed attackers were Trump supporters' Ryan Fournier tweeted: 'Jussie Smollett is a liar and a fraud' ‘There was never any real attack,’ according to Ryan Fournier. ‘Jussie paid to be attacked and then made it look like Trump supporters did it' Andrew Surabian tweeted: ‘And just like with Covington, the media was all too willing to help Jussie Smollett pull off his hoax and in the process frame Trump supporters in the court of public opinion before any actual facts came out’ ‘Jussie paid to be attacked and then made it look like Trump supporters did it. ‘This is how mentally insane the left has become. They will do anything to bring us down. ‘Well it’s not happening because Jussie is going to jail.’ Fournier also tweeted: ‘Jussie Smollett is a liar and a fraud. ‘He needs to be punished for faking an assault and framing Trump supporters.’ Others compared the Smollett case to last month’s controversy surrounding the teens from Covington, Kentucky, who were filmed making faces at a Native American protester in front of the Lincoln Memorial. A number of teens from a Catholic high school wore red ‘Make America Great Again’ hats. Andrew Surabian tweeted: ‘And just like with Covington, the media was all too willing to help Jussie Smollett pull off his hoax and in the process frame Trump supporters in the court of public opinion before any actual facts came out.’

Late on Friday, police sources said that cops had seized a bottle of bleach from Smollett's apartment, according to Fox News correspondent Matt Finn.

Meanwhile, new information surfaced about the Osundairo brothers, who in the course of 48 hours went from 'potential persons of interest' to 'potential suspects' to being under arrest because investigators had 'probable cause that they were involved in a crime' to being set free.

Since their release on Friday night, they have been staying at an undisclosed location.

Police said that the brothers were the two men who were seen on a surveillance image released to the public, and Smollett positively identified the two men in the image as his attackers in a televised interview.

The two brothers are both strongly opposed to President Donald Trump and fervently pro-LGBT, fellow Empire cast and crew members tell TMZ. Both men are said to be loyal fans of former President Barack Obama.

Smollett is said to be close with the brothers and would frequently approach them on set to discuss health and fitness.

Colleagues on the tight-knit Empire set said they had a hard time imagining that the Osundairo brothers could have been involved in the kind of homophobic and bigoted attack that Smollett described.

Abimbola, pictured, was booked on DUI and speeding charges in July 2015 according to Chicago arrest records. The brothers were picked up at Chicago O'Hare Airport on Wednesday

Police initially said that they tied the brothers to the reported attack using meticulous investigative efforts, including surveillance videos and information from ride-sharing companies.

Although Smollett said he did not know who attacked him, both brothers are known to the actor and he follows them on social media.

Their shared Instagram account also features a video of them working out at the private gym in Smollett's luxury apartment block.

The brothers left Chicago for Nigeria hours after the attack.

Celebrities rally behind Empire's Jussie Smollett after he is 'brutally attacked' in Chicago Celebrities and fans alike rallied to lend their support to Jussie Smollett after the 35-year-old actor claimed he was attacked last month. Janet Jackson took to her Twitter to share a special message for the actor, along with a photo of the two of them together. 'Sending so much luv and healing energy your way @jussiesmollett. we know that you’ll continue to change the world,' added Fergie. The sentiment was shared by Shonda Rhimes, who said: 'Sending love, healing, and support to @jussiesmollett. We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this, REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE.' Naomi Campbell posted a impassioned plea to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to find the people responsible for the attack. Sending love to Jussie and the Smollett family after this horrific attack. We support you and pray that you find peace and justice,' said John Legend. 'This is heartbreaking and terrifying...please pay attention to what's happening here,' said Zendaya. 'Sending all my love to @JussieSmollett.' 'No words. Love to you @JussieSmollett,' added Margaret Cho. 'This is horrifying,' said Jamilah Lemieux. 'We love you @JussieSmollett. May justice be swift and unflinching.' '@JussieSmollett I love you,' said Tika Sumpter '@JussieSmollett praying you have a full and speedy recovery. So sorry this happened to you, added Raegan Gomez. Many condemned the racist and homophobic behavior and demanded justice. Ana Navarro said: 'I saw Jussie Smollett in Miami last week. I can't believe this happened. It is sad and disgusting and and deplorable.' The sentiment was shared by Reverend Al Sharpton, who added: 'The reported hate attack on my friend and brother, actor Jussie Smollett is despicable and outrageous. The guilty must face the maximum.' 'Sending so much love and prayers to you, @jussiesmollett. I’m in disbelief of what happened to you,' added Eva Longoria. 'It’s a senseless act that shall be met with justice! I can’t believe this is happening in 2019. This world has no room for hate. #AwaitingJustice' Others took the moment to throw criticism at 'gay jokes' and Kevin Hart's recent appearance on Ellen where he addressed the controversy surrounding his hosting the Oscars. Actor Ryan Jamaal Swain stated: 'This is why holding ""a little homophobic joke'""accountable is taken so FREAKING SERIOUSLY. To quote @amandaseales, you have to be overly confident...black gay men have to deal w/ not only racism but homophobia.' It is always abt duality and a form of respect. @JussieSmollett 'Given what we’ve seen so far, I fully expect the men who attacked Jussie Smollett to score a sit-down interview with Ellen at some point in the next few weeks,' said Saeed Jones. 'Maybe it will be a roundtable discussion with Kevin Hart.'

Their shared apartment was also raided by police, who took away bottles of bleach, electronics, a red hat and a pair of Nike shoes.

The FBI is also involved in the investigation after Smollett reported receiving hate mail.

Federal investigators have taken the lead on the mail case, and are supporting Chicago police in the investigation into Smollett's report of an assault.

Police have been cautious in their official public statements about the case. At last report, investigators still officially considered Smollett a victim in the case.

Smollett has continued to angrily denounce any speculation that the attack did not occur as he described, ascribing racist motives to skeptics and saying that no one would doubt him if he had reported being attacked by non-white assailants.

'I will never be the man that this did not happen to,' he told ABC on Wednesday. 'I am forever changed.'"

Numerous outlets are now reporting that officials believe the actor was involved in coordinating the alleged hate-crime attack.

UPDATE (9:02pm PST): Jussie Smollett's camp have released a statement denying all reports that the actor coordinated the January attack.



“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" his legal team stated late Saturday night. ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

His camp confirmed that the men did know Smollett and that one was his personal trainer he hired for a music video. They also stated they are cooperating with police.



***



Law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation into the alleged hate-crime involving Jussie Smollett say they believe the actor coordinated the attack himself.

The two men who were arrested earlier this week on probable cause in connection to the incident have provided new evidence that has redirected the investigation. Police are requesting to interview Smollett immediately.

“We can confirm that the information received from individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case have in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” a police spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Sources confirmed with numerous outlets Saturday afternoon that the two men were instructed by Smollett to purchase the rope that was found around his neck after the incident. Police were able to recover a receipt showing the men did purchase the item.

The actor has a prior relationship with the two men, who he met while working on his show Empire after one played an extra. A lawyer representing the men have told reporters they are friends with Smollett and have even worked out with the actor at a Chicago gym.

The Advocate was able to confirm this through sources and found that Smollett follows the men on their social media pages. The two men would frequently use Smollett’s music in videos they published on their profiles.

Lawyers and spokespeople for Smollett could not be reached to discuss this emerging news.

Earlier this week, Smollett’s phone records that detailed his calls during the night of his alleged hate-crime attack in Chicago were rejected by local police as evidence in the investigation. The actor had made signification redactions in a PDF he delivered to officers that was deemed tampered.

The Empire star — who came out on Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show in 2015 — reported the incident last month and told police he was stopped around 2 a.m. on January 29 in downtown Chicago by two men wearing ski masks and yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The individuals then reportedly placed a noose around Smollett’s neck, punched him, and poured an unknown substance on his body.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to interviews conducted by the Chicago police with the actor. Smollett’s manager has told police he heard this language among racial and homophobic slurs.

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck returning to his building after the reported incident has been recovered by the police but has yet to be released. Local police say they will not release this footage until the investigation in finished.

The actor recently told Good Morning America that he stands by his story and was frustrated at criticism that he was lying. Smollett also said the men in a blurry photo released by police where the people who attacked him. However, police have identified the subjects of the video as the men who are now cooperating with them.

The men are of Nigerian descent and do not identify as white.

Chicago police have not filed any charges related to the incident, and Smollett is still named a “victim” at the time of reporting.

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that police now believe Smollett paid two men arrested previously and spoke to investigators, adding that police have records of the two men purchasing rope that Smollett said was tied around his neck at a Chicago-area Ace Hardware store.

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,"" the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett's representative did not immediately return request for comment.

The news comes hours after Smollett issued a denial of a Variety report claiming he had hired the criminal defense attorney representing President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Two men arrested on suspicion of conducting the assault on Smollett were also released without charges or explanation from police.

“The individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi said earlier Saturday.

It also comes just two days after Chicago police denied of news reports claiming that police believed the incident to be a hoax, despite Smollett and his family's insistence that the perpetrators would be caught and brought to justice.

“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Guglielmi said Thursday, according to Variety. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”

Smollett claimed earlier this month to have been attacked around 2:00 a.m. in a Chicago neighborhood while walking by two men who shouted ""MAGA"" and other pro-Trump slogans before attacking him. Smollett also claimed to have heard racist and homophobic slurs during the attack."

They're now cooperating with police.

A source close to the investigation confirms to CBS News the brothers told detectives Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack on January 29 and that they purchased the rope — which was found around Smollett's neck — at a nearby hardware store. The source said detectives have evidence to corroborate the sale, something the men's attorney alluded to Friday night.

""New evidence that was brought to their attention, obviously I had it, my clients had it,"" said Gloria Schmidt, the brothers' attorney.

The Chicago Police Department released a statement Saturday night saying information from the brothers had ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Smollett's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, issued a statement late Saturday saying Smollett was ""angered and devastated"" by reports that he knew the people associated with the alleged attack.

""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity,"" the statement said.

The attorneys said the actor would continue to cooperate with authorities as the investigation continues. ""At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to 'unnamed' sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels,"" the statement said.

Police said the two men — identified as Ola and Abel Osundairo — were captured on surveillance video at the time that Smollett said he was attacked.

Ola Osundairo is connected to Smollett through the hit show ""Empire"" where he played a prisoner in season two.

Both brothers apparently left Chicago on the day of the alleged attack and were detained when they returned Wednesday. Chicago detectives tore through their apartment looking for clues, and an evidence log shows they found ropes, masks and bleach. They were released Friday night without charges.

A Chicago Police Department spokesperson said ""detectives have additional investigative work to complete.""

In a recent interview with ""Good Morning America,"" Smollett said he was sure the men in the photo were his attackers.

""And then I see the attacker, masked. And he said, 'This is MAGA country, n*****.' Punches me right in the face. So, I punched his ass back,"" Smollett said. ""I think what people need to hear is just the truth.""

Smollett has not spoken publicly about the arrest and subsequent release of the two brothers. Earlier this week, Chicago police said Smollett was still being treated as a victim, not a suspect."

Chicago police now believe “Empire” TV actor Jussie Smollett paid two pals to fake the attack that he has insisted was carried out by a pair of homophobic and racist strangers, according to a stunning new report.

The buddies — body-builder brothers from Nigeria — told cops they purchased the rope for the noose recovered from Smollett’s neck ­after the attack, Fox’s Chicago affiliate reported Saturday night, citing multiple Chicago law-enforcement sources.

The two are cooperating with the probe, and have turned over to cops the Ace Hardware receipt for their purchase of the rope, Fox 32 reported.

The brothers are models and actors Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, and both have worked as extras on the TV series and use the same gym as Smollett.

The two had been arrested as persons of interest Wednesday, but were released without charges on Friday after agreeing to ‘fess up — or face battery charges, the station reported.

Meanwhile, investigators are eager to speak again with Smollett, who has lawyered up, the Chicago Tribune reported on Saturday.

Police told the paper that they’ve reached out to the star’s legal team to request an interview.

Smollett has at least three lawyers: Todd Pugh, Victor P. Henderson, and Michael Monico, a high-powered criminal attorney who also reps Michael Cohen, the former lawyer for Donald Trump.

On Saturday night, Pugh and Henderson issued a statement on Smollett’s behalf, downplaying the actor’s friendship with the brothers and insisting that his client is a hate crime victim.

“Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the lawyers said, according to ABC reporter Joshua Hoyos.

“At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to ‘unnamed’ sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.”

Smollett’s account of being attacked — given first to cops, and then in interviews with magazines and on national television — had been vivid and terrifying.

The 36-year-old openly gay actor, who plays singer-songwriter Jamal Lyno on the hit Fox series, told cops he’d just left a Subway restaurant on Jan. 29, early Tuesday morning, when two thugs approached.

“Empire!” he said they yelled as they recognized him.

When he ignored them, the two began shouting homophobic slurs, then started beating him in the face, he said.

At one point they poured what cops called “a chemical substance” on him, likely bleach, he said. Then one fixed a noose around the actor’s neck, he claimed.

“This is MAGA country, n——!” he told ABC’s Good Morning America the attackers shouted.

“I come really, really hard againist [Trump’s] administration,” he explained in the Feb. 14 interview of being singled out for the attack.

He also said the attackers were likely white.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more,” he said.

Messages of support began pouring in on social media from Smollett’s fans, co-stars and even politicians.

Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris termed the assault a “an attempted modern day lynching” in a tweet that by Saturday night had garnered a slew of snarky responses.

“Ready to retract this statement?” tweeted @Ollie—Derp.

Doubts arose quickly after the alleged attack.

Neighbors told The Post that such an incident would be highly uncharacteristic for the area.

And Chicago police said Smollett stalled in turning over cell phone records that would have verified his account of having been on the phone with his manager when he was jumped.

Even Smollett’s decision to tell his “attack” story again and again in the media raised suspicion.

Smollett was quickly “adamant” that he wanted to be on TV, said one source with knowledge of the GMA booking decision.

“When Kim Kardashian was the victim of that horrific burglary in Paris, she went to ground, she closed down, she gave no interviews for months. You can see how shaken she was.

“But Jussie was adamant that he wanted TV right away. He raised his voice and said, ‘I need to do this right now. I’m a black gay man and people need to know what happened to me. I want to tell my story.’ He wanted media right away.”

Then, last Wednesday, the brothers were linked to the video and arrested — and the case began to fall apart.

Smollett had insisted on GMA that the then-unidentified, shadowy figures on the video were the masked, racist “strangers” who attacked him.

But Chicago police realized the two men on the video are Abel and Ola — Smollett’s close friends.

“The two suspects released yesterday were, in fact, on the scene and in the surveillance ­image,” police spokeswoman Jessica Rocco told The Post Saturday.

“Information received from the brothers during the interview process have in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” said another Chicago police spokesperson, Christine Calace, without offering more details.

Reports first surfaced Thursday that cops were investigating claims that the attack was staged to keep Smollett from being written off the show — a theory the actor has denied.

“At first, it was the thing of like, listen, if I tell the truth, then that’s because it’s the truth. Then it became a thing of, like, how can you doubt that? How can you not believe that? It’s the truth,” Smollett had insisted on “GMA.”

CBS News Chicago reports:

Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the ‘Empire’ actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25. The brothers were paid $3,500 before leaving for Nigeria and were promised an additional $500 upon their return.

“2 #CPD sources tell @fox32news the brothers arrested & released in #JussieSmollett case told detectives they were paid by the #Empire actor to orchestrate the attack,” Fox 32 Chicago reporter Rafer Weigel tweeted. “Detectives also have a receipt for the rope found on #Smollett neck showing the brothers bought it.”

CNN also reported that two Chicago law enforcement officials told the network that they believe Smollett paid the two brothers to coordinate the attack, noting “the sources told CNN that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.”

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source told Deadline.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony said. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Police arrested the two brothers on Wednesday “at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and their apartment was searched Thursday,” the Associated Press reported, adding, “They were questioned Friday but police were obliged to release them if they had not been charged within 48 hours.”

“Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Guglielmi tweeted.

On January 29, Smollett claimed that he was attacked in the early morning hours near his apartment in Chicago. “Two masked assailants poured ‘an unknown chemical substance’ on him, possibly bleach, and wrapped a rope around his neck, he told police,” according to ABC News. “In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett alleges that the attackers yelled ‘MAGA country,’ a reference to President Donald Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan.”

Within hours of the alleged attack, Democrats, including socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), immediately tweeted on the story without waiting for all the facts to come out.

“There is no such thing as ‘racially charged,'” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “This attack was not ‘possibly’ homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.”

In an interview on Good Morning America, Smollett said: “It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black (who attacked me), I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more, a lot more and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

“For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,” Smollett continued. “I didn’t need to add anything like that. They called me a f—-, they called me a n—-. There’s no which way you cut it. I don’t need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.”

8:15 PM PT -- Jussie's lawyer just responded with this ... ""As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

6:15 PM PT -- Chicago PD's Chief Communications Officer confirms the case has taken a turn based on details provided by the brothers, saying ... ""The information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.""

He adds that police have reached out to Jussie's attorney to request a follow-up interview.

Jussie Smollett has turned from a presumed victim to suspect in the criminal investigation into the alleged racist, homophobic attack, and sources say there is mounting evidence the 2 brothers who were arrested and subsequently released were acting at Jussie's behest and reportedly paid.

Our sources say the brothers -- both of whom worked on the ""Empire"" set -- ""completely cooperated"" with Chicago cops during their interrogation over the last few days.

One law enforcement source tells TMZ at least one of the brothers turned over his phone and there is a call between him and Jussie in the vicinity of the ""attack,"" but before it happened.

CNN is reporting the brothers purchased what looks like the rope Jussie had around his neck at a Chicago Ace Hardware store. CNN is also citing law enforcement sources saying Jussie paid the brothers to orchestrate the phony assault.

Various sources in the Chicago PD have told TMZ almost from the beginning there was wide sentiment Jussie's version of events were false, despite the party line that he was the victim of a crime.

As we told you ... the Nigerian brothers never fit the profile of Jussie's alleged attackers, even when they were arrested for battery. Not only are they not white -- which contradicts Smollett's claims from the beginning -- but ""Empire"" cast and crew sources tell us they're very close to Jussie ... and they're pro-LGBTQ and anti-Trump too.

Chicago PD released Abel and Ola late Friday night due to ""new evidence"" gathered from their interrogation ... and said they're no longer suspects."

As CrimeOnline previously reported, two brothers were arrested earlier this week in connection with the “Empire” star’s allegations but were later released without charge. At that time, police downplayed rumors that the January 29 attack in Chicago was a hoax, saying there was “no evidence” that Smollett was involved in planning the alleged assault.

According to WPIX, the two men are fully cooperating with investigators.

Police reportedly believe Smollett paid the men to perpetrate the attack, which he told police had been carried out by assailants “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.”

The sources who spoke to CNN say police have evidence that the brothers purchased a rope later found around Smollett’s neck from a local Ace Hardware location.

Smollett addressed the controversy around his story in an interview on “Good Morning America” this week, blaming racism for the incredulity of some critics.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” he said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Illinois prosecutor-turned-defense attorney Michael Monico, who represents President Donald Trump’s disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen, confirmed this week that he is now representing Smollett, as previously reported by CrimeOnline.

It was not clear from his statement how long the actor has been a client nor what the scope of his representation covers.

Law enforcement sources have revealed that Chicago police say new evidence suggests Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate his hate crime assault, CNN reports.

Meanwhile, a separate report from USA Today reveals that the two Nigerian brothers who were arrested Wednesday (Feb. 13) as “potential suspects” in the case—Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo—told investigators that the Empire actor paid them to stage an attack on him.

The brothers, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, were released without charges Friday after Chicago police discovered new evidence and are now cooperating fully with law enforcement, the sources said.

Smollett told police he was attacked in the early morning hours of January 29th by two masked men who punched him and called him racist and gay slurs.

The Empire star also said the men, who he believed to be white, poured an unknown “chemical substance,” possibly bleach, on him and put a noose around his neck before shouting “This is MAGA country!”

Sources told CNN that records show that the Osundairo brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

As we reported yesterday, Abel and Ola were taken into custody Wednesday at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport not long after they arrived back to the United States on a flight from Nigeria, where they had been staying since the attack. Coincidentally, the brothers hopped on a plane to Nigeria, their home country, the same day of the incident.

Internet sleuths discovered that the Osundairo brothers, who are both actors, worked as extras on the Chicago set of Empire, and police linked the brothers to Smollett and the show’s creator Lee Daniels through online phone records.

One of the brothers even posed for a photo with Daniels on the set of an Empire episode, which the writer/director shared on social media in 2015. On top of that, Smollett follows at least one of the brothers on Instagram, and, according to the brothers’ lawyer, Smollett sometimes goes to the gym with them.

Chicago police raided the Abel and Ola Osundairo’s house Wednesday night, and a relative who was at the home said police took bleach, a “black facemask hat,” an Empire script, shoes, electronics, receipts, and other items.

Gloria Schmidt, the brothers’ attorney, insists her clients had nothing to do with the Empire star’s alleged attack.

“They are baffled about why they are people of interest,” she told CBS News on Friday. “It’s an awful thing that happened to Jussie, but it’s not my guys.”

Smollett said in an interview with Good Morning America that aired Thursday that he was “pissed off” because he didn’t understand why some people thought his hate crime assault story was a hoax.

“If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” he said."

“The new direction of the investigation is now based on the premise that Mr. Smollett was an active participant in the incident,” a law enforcement source close to the situation told Deadline today.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” a Chicago PD statement late Saturday declared. “We’ve reached out to the ‘Empire’ cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Lawyers for Smollett have been contacted by law enforcement in the last several hours. In anticipation of such requests, the Empire star has in recent days retained attorneys Victor P. Henderson and Todd Pugh. The Chicago-based lawyers specialize in criminal defense.

Today’s new “trajectory” statement is the first official update on the case since the department’s remarks last night stated: “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete.”

This comes as CNN is reporting that sources in the Chicago PD tell them that the actor who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox drama “paid two men to orchestrate the assault.”

The two men in question are Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who police previously described as “potential suspects.”

The two were released by authorities at 9 p.m. Chicago time Friday after being arrested and held without charge by the police department for 48 hours. Chicago detectives are now following the lead that the brothers purchased the rope that was placed around Smollett’s neck in the early hours of January 29, when he was supposedly attacked by two men screaming racist and homophobic slurs.

At least one of the two has appeared as an extra on the Chicago-filmed Empire and seems to know Smollett socially.

Solidly supportive of Smollett in the immediate aftermath and days since January 29, Fox had no comment today on the shifting direction of the investigation when contacted by Deadline. On the day of the attack, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said in a statement they were “deeply saddened and outraged” by the assault.

At the same time and in the following days, Smollett’s Empire co-workers, colleagues, many across the industry and even President Donald Trump expressed support and outrage at the attack that the actor described.

A sold out February 2 West Coast live show at the Troubadour saw Smollett take the stage to cheers and describe how he fought back against his assailants to even stronger cheers.

Facing doubts about the event as police searched for “persons of interest” and Smollett handed over limited phone records to them, the performer went on Good Morning America on February 14 to say he thought the attack occurred because of his ongoing criticism of Trump. “I come really, really hard against 45,” he told GMA co-host Robin Roberts. “I come really, really hard against his administration, and I don’t hold my tongue.”

This week, Fox didn’t hold its tongue at all in refuting any notion that Smollett may have staged the attack because his exit from Empire was being considered by producers. “The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous,” said 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment on Valentine’s Day. “He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

Empire co-creator Danny Strong and writers on the hip-hop centered series also refuted the rumor that local Chicago media was running with on the Windy City-filmed show.

Reps for Smollett did not return request for comment on their client’s perspective or situation.

Breaking news out of Chicago this evening that law enforcement officials investigating the alleged racial attack on Smollett was planned by him.

According to CNN…

Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The brothers, who were arrested Wednesday, were released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of “new evidence.” The sources told CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement. Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.” He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him. The sources told CNN that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

Jussie’s story started falling apart at the exact moment he refused to give police his phone records from the night of the “attack.” Why would you not want the police to be able to back up your story and the timeline to find help give them clues and retrace your movements to help them catch the perps?

His interview on Good Morning America on Wed in retrospect was a horrible idea and if this new info is true was a terrible attempt to do some P.R. damage control. That interview had him expressing his frustration with not being believed while not cooperating fully with police.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Well, it turns out the two men cooperating are both black and are now cooperating fully with police. Kinda ironic.

Let’s see how fast Fox entertainment moves to ax him from his spot on the T.V. show and what the Chicago police charge Smollet with if they actually have the goods on him if he is lying.

Chicago Police said that two Nigerian brothers questioned for their connection to Smollett through the show “Empire” confirmed they were the two suspects in the video surveillance footage Smollett claimed were the pro-Trump assailants.

“Yes, they are confirmed to be the men on scene by surveillance video,” Chicago Police said in a statement to ABC7 Chicago. “The reason why they were there is now central to the investigation and we can’t get into that at this time.”



From CNN:

“The brothers, who were arrested Wednesday, were released without charges Friday after Chicago police cited the discovery of ‘new evidence.’ The sources told CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement.”

“Smollett told authorities he was attacked early January 29 by two men who were ‘yelling out racial and homophobic slurs.’ He said one attacker put a rope around his neck and poured an unknown chemical substance on him.”

“The sources told CNN that there are records that show the two brothers purchased the rope found around Smollett’s neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.”

Additionally, Chicago Police said they were “eager” to speak to Smollett in light of new evidence provided by the brothers.

“We have been in touch with Smollett’s attorneys. We contacted his attorneys last night after interrogation for a meeting. We made our intentions clear,” said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

In an interview on “Good Morning America” earlier this week, Smollett expressed his frustration with being doubted when additional details began to poke holes in his allegations.

“It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,” Smollett said. “And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.”

Smollett hired Michael Cohen’s lawyer Thursday as public opinion began to turn against him, but it remains to be seen in what capacity he’d be represented.

The two men were reportedly released without charges Friday by the Chicago police after being apprehended earlier in the week. Police cited “new evidence” as the reason for their decision to let the two go that police initially believed had initiated a hate crime against the Emipre actor. The sources also told CNN that the brothers had purchased the noose at a local Ace Hardware store.

Late January, the actor claimed that he’d been assaulted by two men after hours shortly upon arriving in Chicago. Smollett said that the men yelled racist and homophobic epithets at him. He also said they put a noose around his neck, which he was wearing when police came by to investigate the alleged incident.

Since then, Smollett has stuck by his accusations, often expressing frustration that some have doubted his claims. Last week ABC7 came under fire for claiming that “multiple sources” had claimed that Smollett had faked the assault, which were then debunked by a Chicago police representative.

CNN hasn’t revealed their sources, nor have they been able to successfully acquire a response from Smollett and his attorney. This story is thus still developing, but there have been a curious number of leaks about the ongoing investigation that paint this story in an increasingly confusing light.

On Saturday night, Chicago Police confirmed to PJ Media that the testimonies of two black men arrested in the case of Empire star Jussie Smollett have flipped the story. Rather than considering Smollett the victim of an attack, it appears that police may now see him as the perpetrator of a hoax.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago Police chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi told PJ Media. “We’ve reached out to the Empire cast member’s attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Two law enforcement sources confirmed to CNN that police are considering the Jussie Smollett case a hoax. Police now think the two men they arrested last week — Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo and his brother Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo — were paid by Smollett to attack him. Chicago Police believe the Empire star orchestrated the assault. A police spokesman told PJ Media the department will release a statement within the hour.

The Osundairo brothers, arrested Wednesday, were released without charges on Friday after police discovered “new evidence.” The men are cooperating with law enforcement.

As late as Friday afternoon, police were considering Smollett a victim rather than the perpetrator of a crime. At that point, however, his story had already started to fall apart.

Smollett claims that on January 29, masked white attackers wearing MAGA hats had screamed, “This is MAGA country!” before seizing him, putting a noose around his neck, and pouring an unknown bleach-scented liquid on him.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records to police, but Guglielmi said those records “do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” ABC7 Chicago reported.

This week, the New York Post discovered a suspicious hot sauce bottle containing a bleach-scented liquid that may have been planted at the scene to corroborate Smollett’s story.

Sources say the Osundairo brothers bought the rope found around Smollett’s neck at a hardware store nearby and red hats at a beauty supply store.

Smollett had just appeared on Good Morning America when police leaked the news about the rope.

On Friday, Smollett hired Michael D. Monico, the lawyer representing President Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen. Smollett denies hiring a defense attorney, but Monico confirmed he had been hired by Smollett.

That should do wonders for Smollett’s credibility…

This news also presents interesting questions for the politicians and activist groups who seized on the Smollett story as evidence of widespread hate and intolerance.

“Chicago Police believe Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault. The sources tell CNN that the two men are now cooperating fully with law enforcement,” tweeted CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz Saturday evening.

Earlier Saturday, Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel, citing several police sources, reported Abimbola “Abel” and Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo — the two Nigerian brothers arrested and later questioned by police about the alleged incident — purchased the rope found around the actor’s neck the night of the alleged attack at an ACE hardware store.

CBS Chicago’s Charlie De Mar reports at least one of the brothers bought the rope at Craft Beaver hardware store the weekend of January 25th. The rope was purchased at the direction of Smollett, De Mar, citing sources, added.

Further, the brothers were paid $3,500 before traveling to Nigeria and promised an extra $500 upon their return, according to De Mar.

The dramatic developments come after Chicago police released the two men, citing to “new evidence” obtained in their interrogations. “Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” said Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

In a phone interview with New York Times reporter Sopan Deb, Guglielmi would not confirm Weigel’s report, but did say, “After we spoke to the former suspects last night, detectives reached out to Jussie Smollett’s attorneys and expressed interest that we need to talk to him again.”

On Wednesday, the Osundairo brothers were arrested by police at O’Hare Airport after returning from a trip to Nigeria to visit family, and brought in for questioning. The brothers were reportedly spotted on surveillance footage in the Chicago neighborhood where the alleged incident occurred. Gloria Schmidt, an attorney for the brothers had told CBS 2 that her clients could be charged on Friday. “They were actually detained at customs at O’Hare airport yesterday around 5:45 p.m.,” Schmidt said. “They had no idea what was going on, and they’ve been detained since then.”

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” she continued.

The lawyer confirmed the Osundairos had been extras on Empire and went to the gym with Smollett.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” beat him and looped a rope around his neck early on January 29 before fleeing the scene. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him. Smollett, 36, said he was out getting food at a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago when the attack occurred.

Smollett has maintained that he has been truthful about the incident, contending his story has not changed since it took place. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to ESSENCE magazine. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Michael Monico, the high-powered criminal defense attorney representing longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, revealed Thursday that he is also representing Smollett, a sign the actor-singer may be gearing up for a major legal battle.

In his first interview since the alleged attack, Smollett told ABC’s Good Morning America he was targeted due to his outspokenness against President Donald Trump and his administration. “I come really, really hard against 45. I come really hard against his administration. I don’t hold my tongue,” he told Robin Roberts in a sitdown that aired Friday.

The alleged encounter spurred Democrat presidential contenders and score of Hollywood celebrities to condemn the attack — for which many of those entertainment and politic figures blamed President Donald Trump.

Reacting to the alleged incident, comedian Billy Eichner tweeted: “Heartbroken and furious reading about the attack on @JussieSmollett. I want Trump and all MAGA lunatics to burn in Hell.”

“The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) condemned the alleged assault, describing it as an “attempted modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate,” she said.

In response to the alleged attack, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) had even called on the House to pass legislation that would designate lynching a federal hate crime — re-upping the bill, which passed the Senate in December.

President Trump also weighed in on the matter, calling the alleged attack “horrible,” adding that “It doesn’t get worse.”

Smollett could receive between one to three years in jail for filing a false police report under State of Illinois law.

In a statement Saturday night, attorneys for Jussie Smollett strongly denied that the “Empire” star faked the attack he reported on Jan. 29, and said “anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, said in their statement that the actor “has been further victimized” by these claims, and identified one of the men police arrested, then released without charges on Friday, as Smollett’s personal trainer.

The trainer, who was unnamed in the statement, was preparing Smollett for a music video, the statement said. “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity,” the statement continues.

Here’s the full statement:

As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying. One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity. Jussie and his attorneys anticipate being further updated by the Chicago Police Department on the status of the investigation and will continue to cooperate. At the present time, Jussie and his attorneys have no inclination to respond to “unnamed” sources inside of the investigation, but will continue discussions through official channels.

CNN’s sources said records show that the two brothers, whom TheWrap confirmed with police are of Nigerian descent, purchased the rope at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

The actor has pushed back on past speculation, shared on social media, that the attack was a hoax. In an interview with “Good Morning America” this week, he said people would be more likely to believe him if he had said his attackers were Muslim, Mexican or black.

An attorney for the two men, Gloria Schmidt, did not respond to requests for comment.

But the Chicago Tribune reported Schmidt has previously said that the two brothers have worked with Smollett on “Empire” and work out at the same gym as the actor. Smollett follows their bodybuilding page (@team_abel) on Instagram.

Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that he was battered “about the face,” that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on him, and that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck. The substance turned out to be bleach.

On Saturday morning, a rep for Smollett denied reports that the actor had hired defense attorney Michael D. Monico. Monico, who is currently on Michael Cohen’s defense team, had said Thursday on WGN’s “The Roy Conn Show” that Smollett was his client “at the moment.”

Monico declined to comment when contacted by TheWrap Saturday about whether he repped Smollett.

Chicago police said Saturday the investigation into the attack reported by Jussie Smollett has “shifted” due to information received from two brothers arrested in the case then released, and police want to interview the “Empire” actor again.

Chicago police had released the two Nigerian brothers without charges late Friday and said they were no longer suspects in the reported attack.

“We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an emailed statement Saturday. “We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.”

Guglielmi did not elaborate on what he meant by a shift in the case.

A spokeswoman for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Smollett, who is black and gay, has said he was attacked early Jan. 29 in Chicago by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs and “This is MAGA country!” He said they looped a rope around his neck before running away as he was out getting food at a Subway restaurant. He said they also poured some kind of chemical on him.

Police have said they were investigating the attack as a possible hate crime and considered Smollett a victim. Reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

Smollett said he was co-operating with police and gave an emotional speech during a concert in West Hollywood, California, on Feb. 2 saying that he went ahead with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

Smollett also gave an interview to Robin Roberts of ABC News that aired Thursday, saying that he was “pissed” at people who did not believe he was attacked.

“I've heard that it was a date gone bad, which I also resent that narrative,” he said. “I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive.”

Earlier this week, police said media reports that the attack was a hoax were unconfirmed.

Producers of the Fox television drama supported Smollett, saying his character on “Empire,” James Lyon, was not being written off the show.

Police said they combed surveillance video in the heavily-monitored downtown Chicago area but were unable to find any footage of the attack.

Smollett turned over redacted phone records that police said were not sufficient for a criminal investigation.

Police released grainy images of two people they said were in the area at the time of the reported attack and said they wanted to question them.

On Wednesday, Chicago police picked up the Nigerian brothers - one of whom they said worked on “Empire” - at O'Hare International Airport as they returned from Nigeria. They described them as “suspects” in the assault, questioned them and searched their apartment.

Then, late Friday evening they released the two men without charges and said they were no longer suspects. They said they had gleaned new information from their interrogation of them.

And then on Saturday, Guglielmi said the investigation had shifted."

8:30 PM PT — Jussie's legal team released a statement, lashing out at the reports he paid the Usondairo brothers. “As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" the statement began.

Smollett's attorneys said, ""He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.""

“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video,"" the statement continued, adding, ""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.""

The Jussie Smollett story has taken an unexpected turn after new reports claim the ""Empire"" star paid the brothers to participate in a staged attack.

News regarding the ongoing investigation is being reported by many local reporters in Chicago, who have been hammering the story since it first broke.

CBS correspondent Carter Evans is reporting that Ola and Abel Usondairo, who have been released from custody, told police that Smollett paid them to participate in an alleged attack, and that the two brothers purchased the rope found on the actor's neck.

CNN also reports two law enforcement sources believe Smollett paid the Nigerian men to orchestrate the attack.

As The Blast reported, the Usondairo brothers are friends of Smollett, and have even given him shout-outs on their social media pages. Whether they received any money from the actor has not been confirmed, but as we reported, they both filed for bankruptcy a few years back.



Instagram

Since Smollett appeared on ""Good Morning America"" this week with Robin Roberts and scolded those who questioned his story, he has hired a criminal defense attorney. Page Six is reporting the actor has retained attorney Michael Monico, who also represents Donald Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen.

There were reports earlier in the week that Smollett's story may be a hoax, but Chicago Police have shot down those rumors and still identify him as a victim.

According to reporter Rafer Weigel, detectives have reached back out to Smollett's attorney after releasing the Osundairo brothers from custody and expressed an interested in speaking with the star again."

The Nigerian brothers were arrested on Wednesday and then were released without charges Friday because of “new evidence” and their cooperation with police.

CNN’s latest report is consistent with what other reporters have found:

Two sources close to the investigation told CNN the brothers, Obabinjo Osundairo and Abimbola Osundairo, are cooperating with law enforcement. The sources also said authorities have records showing the two brothers bought the rope found around Smollett's neck at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago.

""A source close to the investigation tells CBS News that 2 brothers — arrested & then released — told detectives that Smollett paid them to participate in the alleged attack, & that they purchased the rope found around Smollett's neck at a hardware store,"" CBS News journalist David Begnaud also reported Saturday.

Smollett claimed he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, when two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him while he was on his way to his Chicago apartment. He also claimed an unknown chemical substance was poured on him and a rope was put around his neck.

The Osundairo brothers were arrested early Friday and released hours later and not charged. Police said they found ""new evidence"" after interrogating the two.

""Due to new evidence as a result of today’s interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the Empire case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Friday.

Gugielmi said the brothers, who both worked on Empire, were no longer considered suspects.

TMZ reports that at least one of the brothers turned his phone over to police. The phone records show a call between him and Smollett near the area of the alleged attack.

The brothers' attorney, Gloria Schmidt, was asked about the ""new evidence"" that led to their release on Friday night. She said it was ""new evidence that was brought to their attention... obviously I had it, my clients had it, but I think it took a matter of coordination.""

During the week, law enforcement sources told local news outlets the attack was ""potentially orchestrated"" by Smollett. Police tried to quell those rumors by insisting there was no evidence it was a hoax yet.

There were also reports Smollett may have orchestrated the attack after learning he would be written off Empire. However, 20th Century FOX Television, the studio that produces the show, said this was not true.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of Empire is patently ridiculous. He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him,"" the studio said.

In his Good Morning America interview Thursday, Smollett responded to the rumors the attack was staged.

""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more,"" he said. ""And that says a lot about the place where we are as a country right now.""
