So did Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and most of today's dozens of Democratic presidential aspirants.

But days ago, three Democratic candidates – Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, California Senator Kamala Harris and former Obama cabinet member Julian Castro of Texas – embraced giving blacks a stratospheric fortune in reparations. Others soon may follow.

For Warren and Harris, this latest ""ginormous"" giveaway was their way to blast past rivals in the Democrats' mad race to win the radical left's checkered black-and-red flag of victory. For Castro, it was his chance as an almost-unknown Latino to buy the attention and votes of African-Americans.

Taking a pro-reparations position is a gamble. For a generation, polls have found that up to 84 percent of white voters oppose this huge political redistribution of wealth based on race … and whites remain, by far, the biggest group of voters in America.

But Democrats face another existential risk. Polling shows that in 2020 Donald Trump could win 20 percent or more of the African-American vote. Democrats have made themselves so dependent on getting 90 percent or more of the black vote that losing even 20 percent of it could mean electoral doom, potentially forever.

This is why Democrats go to radical extremes to stir up black hatred and racial polarization. Is this why actor Jussie Smollett, a rabid Trump-hater, was reportedly willing to prompt a race war by concocting a fake attack on himself by supposedly ""Make America Great Again"" racists? Smollett had been campaigning with Kamala Harris, so did they synchronize his fake attackers using a noose with her proposed anti-lynching legislation?

Do the horrors of slavery merit the recompense of reparations? They certainly do, on the same terms that Japanese-Americans unjustly interned in Manzanar and other camps during World War II received reparation payments of $20,000 apiece in 1988; these reparations went only to 82,000 actually interned, not to their descendants born after World War II.

Every black American ""legally"" enslaved in the United States deserved reparations. But slavery ended by 1865, and any who were then slaves have died. Those who have never been slaves deserve no reparations for slavery, however much they might have been economically disadvantaged by racism.

Progressives try to evade other problems with reparations. Are we to pay their huge costs by taxing those whose ancestors came to America after slavery ended? Or those whose ancestors were never slave owners, including 3 out of 4 Southerners? Or those like my ancestors who fought on the Union side to free those held in slavery?

If you favor reparations for those with American slave ancestors, would you also favor giving vast money to the descendants of the slave owners? This needs an answer, because African-Americans also carry the evil antebellum heritage of slave rape by plantation owners; the average black in America carries in his or her DNA from 14 to 27 percent ""white"" genes from the slave owners. Give reparations to the descendants of slaves and you also give it to benefit the living genes of slave owners.

Kamala Harris was born of a Jamaican father (appalled by her boasting of marijuana use) and a Tamil mother from India; she is not qualified to receive the American slave reparations she supports. The black half of Barack Obama was Kenyan and carried no American slave ancestry, despite attempts by leftist genealogists to claim some. Obama's Muslim family was never slaves in Africa, but they owned slaves and hated the British for ending slavery in Kenya.

So who should pay for American slave reparations? Surely not the innocent people or the government that fought to end slavery. The logical candidate is the Democratic Party – America's racist party of the slave owners, the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow, Bull Connor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's racist internment of Japanese-Americans, and virtually all the evils Ta-Nehisi Coates describes in his 2014 essay ""The Case for Reparations.""

Genocide is more evil than slavery. Why did Elizabeth Warren propose reparations for blacks, not also Native Americans as she pretended to be? Democrats fanatically support Planned Parenthood, whose progressive founder Margaret Sanger advocated birth control to limit ""the unfit""; ""African-Americans make up between 12 percent and 13 percent of the American population,"" writes historian Victor Davis Hanson, ""but account for as many as 35 percent of all abortions.""

In a 2009 interview, wrote Hanson, leftist icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg declared: ""Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want to have too many of.""

The Democratic Party should pay African-Americans $100 trillion from its own vast wealth – not the public treasury – in reparations, then have its politicians and appointees resign from all government offices forever.

By removing their toxic evil that has poisoned America for most of its history, Democrats could achieve what Coates seeks from reparations: ""A national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.""

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox series, supported his onscreen son in an Instagram post on Saturday night.

He shared a video of Smollett playing with his own son Hero on a private plane with the caption: “All your lil homies got you...We love the hell outta you.”

It came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season “to avoid further disruption on the set.”

Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett, 36, was charged on Thursday with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly faking his own hate attack in Chicago.

The actor claimed he was beaten up by two strangers who called him a “f****t,” a “n****r” and shouted, “This is MAGA country” before dousing him in bleach and throwing a rope around his neck.

HOAX ATTACK CLAIMS

Chicago authorities claim he plotted the bizarre scheme to bolster his own career and get a raise.

Smollett has denied it was a hoax and has told cops he has an “untreated” drug problem.

He has also been accused of sending himself a note containing a cartoon figure strung up by a noose and cut-out letters spelling: ""You will die, black f*g"".

Smollett claimed the note was a threat before two Trump fans in MAGA hats shouted racist and homophobic abuse and punched him last month.

The Empire actor could face three years in jail after he was sensationally charged with staging the elaborate street assault so he could play victim.

After being released on bail on Thursday, sources told TMZ that Jussie arrived late on the Empire set and then begged his cast mates to believe he did not orchestrate the hoax.

PLEADED WITH EMPIRE CAST

""I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls,” he said, according to TMZ.

“I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Earlier on Thursday, the actor was told to surrender his passport when he appeared in front of State of Illinois Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr.

The judge called the hate-crime hoax allegations against the star “utterly outrageous"".

TMZ claimed that Smollett may have got his ""hoax homophobic attack plot"" idea from an Instagram post the Empire co-creator shared weeks before.

Director Lee Daniels, 59, posted a heartfelt video on January 10, after his cousin was assaulted because he is gay.

Daniels, who uses the handle theoriginalbigdaddy, told his ""gay brothers and sisters"" it was ""OK to be who you are"" and ""inevitably right will be done"".

The one minute long video had the caption: ""This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories...

""For all the people who are hurting, who are struggling, and who are trying to find some meaning in this life, I am here to say if you need a safe place or a ear to listen, then I’m here.”

The TMZ report claimed Daniels told his cast members more about the attack on set, and they left were visibly upset.

If Smollett was looking to tug at Daniels’ heartstrings, he appeared to initially be successful.

On January 29, the day of Smollett’s alleged hoax attack, Daniels tweeted, “We got this,” accompanied by rainbow and black hand emojis.

In the video, Smollett tickles the child, asks how many teeth he has, and calls him a “sweet baby.”

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you,” the post reads.

As of publication, the video has been watched more than 421,000 times, and features approximately 6,400 comments, many of which are supportive of either Howard’s post or Smollett himself:

“We love him so much….we got his back #IStandWithJussie” “THAT’S WHAT FRIENDSHIP IS ALL ABOUT. Friends don’t give a [middle finger emoji] about the situation. It’s about supporting you, whether s*** is questionable or not! Good job T” “Everybody makes mistakes. I’m sure he’ll learn from this one.”

Others questioned Howard’s apparent support for Smollett:

“Lol you should hold him accountable not enable the lies bro” “I believe in forgiveness but what about accountability. If you’re truly a father figure to him then talk to him about accountability.”

According to multiple outlets, Howard also wrote the following on his Instagram:

Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know. The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.

On Wednesday evening, the Chicago Police Department reported that Smollett had been charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report, and on Thursday morning, Smollett turned himself over to police. The actor was later released from jail after posting bond.

On Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson held a press conference during which he castigated Smollett:

This announcement today recognizes that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims? Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators, as well as the citizens of this city.

Johnson then detailed Smollett’s alleged crimes, stating that the actor was not happy with his salary, so he paid two men approximately $3,500 to help him stage a hate crime on January 29.

Johnson concluded by saying that he’ll “continue to pray for this troubled young man who resorted to both drastic and illegal tactics to gain attention.”"

Black-ish Star Jenifer Lewis on the Jussie Smollett Controversy: 'We Have to Have Compassion'

Jenifer Lewis is urging compassion in the wake of the Jussie Smollett controversy.

Speaking to PeopleTV on the Red Carpet Live special at the 2019 Oscars on Sunday, the black-ish star weighed in as the actor stands accused of filing a false report claiming two men attacked him in an apparent hate crime last month.

“I’m not going to lie to you, I am one of the most compassionate people on this planet. I love people. I’m an entertainer,” said Lewis, 62. “But when we make a mistake — I mean, who knows the true story? But I do know that we have to have compassion. But more than that, there has to be consequences — for whatever happened.”

“Because the temperament of the country right now, it’s fragile,” she continued. “All I can say is let’s all put one foot forward and stand with each other. We need to unite now. It doesn’t matter who does what, because it’s going to be a lot of things going on. Our job is to stand together on the frontline and say, ‘No!’ when we know it’s not right.”

On Thursday, Chicago police held a press conference in which they alleged the Empire star paid $3,500 to stage a “bogus” attack against him to draw attention to himself because he was dissatisfied with his salary. (A source denied to PEOPLE that Smollett, 36, had any sort of issue with his pay, saying, “There’s never been a dissatisfaction with his salary.”)

Smollett, who is black and gay, was arrested on Thursday morning after turning himself in to police, one day after he was charged. He presented in bond court on Thursday afternoon, where a judge set his bond at $100,000; he was released after posting $10,000 bond. He has also been asked to surrender his passport. His next hearing is scheduled for March 14.

He’s facing a felony charge of disorderly conduct. If convicted, he could serve up to three years in prison.

Smollett has maintained his innocence. In a statement released by his attorneys after the press conference, the actor’s legal team said that “presumption of innocence … was trampled upon” in the Empire star’s case.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” the statement began. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon has since been removed from the final two episodes of season 5 to “avoid further disruption on set,” the Fox show’s executive producers said in a statement."

The FBI is disputing the Chicago Police Department’s claim that Jussie Smollett sent a threatening hate letter to himself before allegedly staging his January 29th attack with Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo.

According to TMZ, the FBI says they don’t know who wrote that letter because they’re still investigating. Meanwhile, Jussie says that the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel Osundairo was for training and not to stage a hate crime attack.

Via TMZ:

TMZ has obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the “attack.” The memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.” Sources connected to Jussie tell us, the reference to “Don’t Go” is a song for which Jussie was going to shoot a music video … featuring himself shirtless. The sources say Jussie had gained weight — he was 192 lbs and needed to lose 20 pounds for the shoot, and that’s why he hired Abel … whom he says he calls “Bon.” There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the “attack” — Bon wrote, “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.” Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.” You also see a text showing a calendar where February 23 is marked “Don’t Go.” The sources say that’s the date of the music video shoot. There’s another screenshot from Sept. 27, 2018, presumably showing Jussie has paid Ola in the past. It’s a Venmo payment of $100 to Bola (Abimbola aka Abel) for “Training.” Sources connected to Jussie say the $3,500 breakdown is as follows — $600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks. As we reported, Ola and Abel also told the grand jury the payment was for training. This is not proof the attack wasn’t staged, but in a trial, all the defense has to do is create reasonable doubt, and we’re told the Police Superintendent’s pronouncement will become a defense weapon if the case goes to trial. The Police Superintendent also said during the news conference Jussie himself sent the racist letter 8 days before the attack. Federal law enforcement sources tell us they have not concluded who wrote the letter … at least not yet.

Here’s a picture of Jussie Smollett’s check to Abel Osundairo:

And below are screenshots of various text message exchanges about diet and fitness in the days leading up to the alleged attack:

And here’s the screenshot of a $100 Venmo transaction from Sept. 27, 2018 for “Training”:

Also, here’s a video from Abel’s YouTube channel called “Fat to Fit in 2 Months.”

What the hell is going on? Is the Chicago PD lying on Jussie about that check? And if so, why would they do that? They’re looking really shady right now because they’re the ones who put it out there that the check was for helping Jussie stage the attack.

Almost every single day, this story either changes or has a new development. Are you as tired as we are? Because we’re tired. This is hella draining."

What are the details?

When Chicago Police apprehended Smollett last week, charging him with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, detectives revealed that part of the evidence against Smollett were $3,500 checks paid to brothers Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola Osundairo, 25.

But over the weekend, TMZ reported the checks were not for the alleged attack, a fact the brothers told a grand jury. Instead, the checks were reportedly related to Smollett receiving gym and nutrition training from the brothers.

On Sunday, TMZ obtained documents that confirm those claims. From TMZ:

TMZ has obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ""attack."" The memo line reads, ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.""



Sources connected to Jussie tell us, the reference to ""Don't Go"" is a song for which Jussie was going to shoot a music video ... featuring himself shirtless. The sources say Jussie had gained weight -- he was 192 lbs and needed to lose 20 pounds for the shoot, and that's why he hired Abel ... whom he says he calls ""Bon.""



Sources connected to Jussie say the $3,500 breakdown is as follows -- $600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks.

Additionally, TMZ also obtained text message screenshots that appear to corroborate claims that Smollett was being trained by the Osundairo brothers. The text messages include nutrition and training instructions.

The Osundairo brothers reportedly told a grand jury Smollett paid them for training and nutrition instruction.

“All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,” Howard wrote in an Instagram post on Saturday that featured a video of Smollett tickling a baby.

Howard plays the role of fictional music mogul Lucious Lyon and the father of Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon in “Empire,” a TV drama series on Fox that debuted in 2015. Following Smollett’s arrest last week, Fox announced Smollett’s character had been cut from the final two episodes of the season.

Chicago police say Smollett, 36, paid two brothers to stage an attack against him last month in an attempt to boost his public profile because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire” salary.

Smollett had told police that two men attacked him during the early morning hours of Jan. 29. he said they wrapped a rope around his neck, shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and poured bleach on him. He also said they told him, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s 2016 “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

Police now say Smollett fabricated his story, and some fans slammed Howard for his continuing support of the actor. But the star of the 2004 film “Crash” responded by calling on critics to reserve their judgment.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” Howard wrote. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.”

He continued: “Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Police initially said the alleged assault was being investigated as a hate crime. And in the case’s immediate aftermath, Howard and a range of other celebrities and politicians rallied to Smollett’s side.

But after police tracked down and interviewing the two brothers they said were involved in the incident, authorities arrested Smollett on Wednesday and charged him with orchestrating it.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains he was the victim of a hate crime.

The controversy has sparked backlash from LGBTQ and social justice advocacy groups who worry Smollett’s allegedly false police report will overshadow the real threats that beset their communities.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” his legal team said in a statement on Thursday. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

On Thursday, Chicago police held a press conference in which they alleged Smollett paid $3,500 to stage a “bogus” attack against him to draw attention to himself because he was dissatisfied with his salary. A source denied to PEOPLE that Smollett had any sort of issue with his pay, saying, “There’s never been a dissatisfaction with his salary.”

PEOPLE confirmed Smollett returned to the set of Empire after posting bond Thursday, though the Fox show’s executive producers issued a statement on Friday announcing that the actor’s character Jamal Lyon will be removed from the final two episodes of season 5.

The post on Saturday came a day after “Empire” producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set.”

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some “Empire” cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

As CrimeOnline has previously reported, Smollett was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of orchestrating a hate crime he claimed occurred in January.

Terrence Howard addressed the subject in an Instagram post showing his son playing with laughing Smollett while aboard a private plane, according to Fox News.

“All your lil homies got you…We love the hell outta you,” he wrote, followed by an emoji depicting a heart.

The post got a wide range of responses, including more than 420,000 likes as of this writing. Of course, many of the thousands of comments that followed were critical of Howard for supporting his costar in the face of serious allegations.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” the actor wrote in response to one such critic.

He continued by asserting that the man he has grown to know “could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly.”

Though he stopped short of weighing in on the substance of the evidence being collected, Howard also advised others to do the same.

“His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide,” he wrote. “Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Sen. Kamala Harris greets people at the Story County Democrats' annual soup supper fundraiser in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)

During the hour or so that Kamala Harris, Julián Castro and John Hickenlooper spent at a soup dinner at an Ames, Iowa, church Saturday night, a storm struck. A steady, icy snow coated cars and wrought instant slippery havoc on the sidewalks around Iowa State University. But Harris was scheduled for another event shortly thereafter in Des Moines, about a half-hour south, so she (and those following her) had to hurry down Interstate 35 through what had become a blizzard.

I nearly induced instantaneous carpal tunnel syndrome with a death grip on the steering wheel, one that only grew tighter as I passed car after car — and a few overconfident pickup trucks, too — spun out by the side of the road. Only with luck did I make it in time to sneak quietly through the doors of Harris’s event just as she was taking the stage.

This white-knuckled slip-and-slide is, in some ways, a perfect description of my first month and a half on the politics beat. I don’t think I’m alone in the feeling that publicly engaging with politics these days is much like driving through an Iowa blizzard. The process punishes recklessness with social media spinouts. Slippery spots can hide in plain sight, sending those new to the roads and those experienced with them sliding in directions they never expected. But those aspects of life on a politics beat haven’t surprised me. Neither has the weather. Other aspects, however, have not been what I thought they would be.

In Iowa, presidential politics just mix with everyday life — or interrupt it. What has surprised me in my early days on the campaign trail is that a lot of these early moments are, for lack of a better word, real. Mistakes happen. People ask strange questions. Some people don’t want to be bothered, like the man I met at one of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-N.Y.) events who usually votes Republican but just happened to end up at the wrong coffee shop for his lunch break. I saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the line for the bathroom after getting off my first flight to Iowa, which was actually a flight to Omaha — a recommendation made by my colleagues that initially had me wondering whether they were trying to haze me.

As it turned out, Omaha is just across the river from Council Bluffs, where I attended my first event. Warren made her case for the presidency as others bowled away their Friday nights in the next room. Later in that trip, she lost her voice and was left rasping to a crowded room at the end of a long day. I asked her staff what they use as the official, inside-politics solution.

“A lot of tea with honey,” they reported. What else can they do?

A few weeks later, I watched Gillibrand introduce herself to a table of unsuspecting college students at a Des Moines coffee shop. After she asked them about what issues they cared about most, one of them turned to me and whispered, “Wait, what is she running for?” I told her.

“Whoa!” she said.

As Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) began to address a couple dozen Iowans in a basement at a house party Friday night, one of his hosts hurried down the stairs to ask whether anyone had called 911. Apparently, a phone in the house had dialed the number over and over, so the police showed up. A woman thought it was hers but was too polite to walk in front of Bennet as he was speaking, and by the time she got to the stairs the police had already left. The woman grabbed a few snacks off the covered pool table instead.

Voters listen to candidates differently from the way reporters do. I can see why people who cover these events regularly start to get cynical or at least start to tune out the message. After hearing it four times, even I could probably repeat Harris’s stump speech by the end of that day. But what I didn’t realize until I got here — and should have, and hope to remember — is that everyone in the crowd is hearing those speeches (and most importantly, those jokes) for the first time. I’ve probably heard Harris say Americans need to base policy on “science fact, not science fiction” about 15 times. But the elderly man in front of me in Ames still chuckled when he heard it Saturday night and elbowed his wife, who did the same.

Voters aren’t talking about the same things as Politics Twitter. At four events Saturday, no voters asked Harris about her initial, “modern-day lynching” response to Jussie Smollett’s alleged attack — just reporters. Her answers to those questions anchored entire segments of cable news coverage this week. When I asked voters about Gillibrand’s much-discussed position switches on immigration and gun control, many of them suggested she should be allowed room to grow.

Iowa voters haven’t made up their minds. I knew I would have to correct for voter bias at these events. I follow Democratic events that draw Democratic voters. Naturally, those voters will be supportive of policies, of critiques of President Trump, of all the usual talking points. They roar when candidates stump for universal background checks and other gun control measures, or when candidates say they “won’t conduct foreign policy by tweet” — and almost all of them say they “won’t conduct foreign policy by tweet.” They cheer when candidates denounce the wall or criticize recent tax cuts for the wealthy. They applaud the mention of universal health care.

But most of the voters to whom I’ve spoken are not attending events because they love the candidate hosting them. They attend these events with a critical eye, having done their research, hoping to hear clear answers to the “what will you do” question and waiting to find the right person to support. Many of them say they would attend events for any Republicans who decided to jump in, too.

Campaigning is hard. For all the recent analysis of what candidates order and how they order it, I’m not sure how anyone has time to eat. Harris and her team, for example, hurried from one event to the other through four events and a sit-down interview that took them from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. — and would have included a two-hour drive to the next stop afterward had the weather not forced them to shelter in place. She is on the younger side of this field. I don’t know how any candidates stay upright. To be honest, it’s not always easy for reporters to stay upright either, and Iowa restaurants don’t stay open as late as they do in Washington.

There’s a lot of optimism. But what I’ve realized is that being on the road, in the snow or rain or biting cold, nibbling on almonds you might have dropped on the floor of the rental car because you don’t have time to get anything else (you know, hypothetically) pays off in the form of a reality check. People smile at these events. They are hopeful and optimistic. They are critical without jumping to conclusions. And they, with the exception of a few longer-winded interrogators, listen more than they speak. In those ways, life on the Iowa campaign trail is much different from what I expected. Social media, it turns out, is not necessarily a great predictor of reality.

POLL WATCH

Trump approval rating. Gallup released a rundown of President Trump's approval rating in all 50 states for 2018. Seventeen states give him approval ratings above 50 percent, five more than in 2017; those states count for 102 electoral votes. The states where his approval rating his less than 40 percent have 201 electoral votes.

His approval rating is between 41 and 49 percent in 13 states, almost all of them in the Midwest and South. They are Arizona (43% approval), Florida (43), Georgia (44), Indiana (48), Iowa (45), Louisiana (49), Michigan (42), Nebraska (49), North Carolina (45), Ohio (48), Pennsylvania (42), Texas (41), and Wisconsin (42) — all states Trump won in 2016.

ON THE TRAIL

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) made a few Iowa stops this weekend as he mulls a run for the White House. Asked Friday about his timeline for a decision, Bennet refused to give one. Asked whether it would be months or weeks, he said, “certainly not months.”

Bennet was one of several undecided candidates traveling the state this weekend, along with former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. With a handful of others considering runs, the Democratic field could grow significantly, even if more high-profile names such as former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke decide not to enter. Among the 13 Democrats running are several of Bennet's Senate colleagues, many of whom benefit from greater national name recognition. In a crowd like that, what does Bennet — whose profile got a boost from an emotional late January floor speech in which he accused Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) of shedding “crocodile tears” during the government shutdown — believe could distinguish him enough to gain traction with early-state voters?

“I think I’ve got a background that’s different from other folks in the race. I’ve got different experiences,” said Bennet, who served as Denver’s superintendent of schools before being appointed to the Senate for his first term.

“A lot of people in Iowa are involved in education. I’ve spent a fair bit of time doing that, too. I’ve spent 10 years on the Agriculture Committee in the Senate. Everybody’s got something different they bring to the race, and the answer to the question ‘why you’ is not mine to answer. It’s for the voters to answer.”

Bennet drew former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack to a house party outside Des Moines Friday night, getting a tacit vote of confidence from Iowa’s Democratic establishment that could help build his local credibility.

Vilsack didn't endorse Bennet, but did praise him: “Celebrity doesn’t matter. . . . We are fortunate that in this race we have an incredible array of talented, substantive people, and certainly among them is Senator Bennet.”

Bennet said he enjoyed hearing from Iowa voters. “What they’re thinking about doesn’t surprise me. A lot of what they’re thinking about is what I’m hearing in Colorado as well. That’s something I wanted to know,” he said.

Those voters might find themselves considering a field that includes two Coloradans, Bennet and Hickenlooper. Bennet described the two as friends and said that while he didn’t plan to see Hickenlooper during their overlapping Iowa swings, he has talked to him about his plans. Bennet served as chief of staff for then-Denver Mayor Hickenlooper before becoming superintendent of schools there. Might their parallel trajectories preclude either man from separating himself from the other, let alone from a loaded field?

“I don’t know who there’s enough room for. I’m not thinking about it that way,” Bennet said. “I’m just thinking about whether there’s an opportunity for me to do something useful here.”

IN THE STATES

We don't necessarily know who is running for a lot of the Senate seats that are up in 2020, but two people whose potential candidacies in their home states have been widely discussed said in the past few days that they are not in.

In Iowa, Democratic former governor and U.S. agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack told the Des Moines Register that he wouldn't challenge Sen. Joni Ernst (R) in the next election.

“I'm confident there are going to be a lot of people stepping up that will have the commitment, the desire and the passion that it takes to win, and I just didn't think I had it,” Vilsack said. No other Democrat has yet entered the race against Ernst, who has said she'll run again and had a 57 percent approval rating in a recent Register poll.

And earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he has “ruled out” a run to replace retiring Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts (R), despite encouragement from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Although Kansas is a red state, going for President Trump in 2016 by 20 points, voters last year elected a Democrat, Laura Kelly, as governor.

2020

Larry Hogan. The Maryland governor is getting more vocal about a potential primary challenge to President Trump, telling The Post that a recent RNC resolution supporting Trump is “almost like a hostage situation.”

Bernie Sanders. He's kicking off his campaign next weekend with rallies in Brooklyn and Chicago, pointing to those places as where his activism began.

Elizabeth Warren. Warren, one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who's said she's open to providing some type of reparations to African Americans, said Native Americans should be “part of the conversation” on reparations.

Sherrod Brown. The senator from Ohio told Las Vegas casino workers that, if he runs, he will be “the most pro-union candidate.”

Cory Booker. He also went to Las Vegas, where the crowd included his mother, who lives nearby.

John Hickenlooper. The former Colorado governor, in Iowa, batted away suggestions that he'd challenge Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in 2020, saying he wasn't “cut out to be a senator.”

Howard shared a video of Smollett on his Instagram page on Saturday evening. The short video shows Smollett holding a baby on his lap, tickling him and breaking into fits of giggles. The caption reads “All your lil homies got you…We love the hell outta you.”

Howard also responded to a fan criticizing his support of Smollett in the comments section.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he wrote. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

On Fox’s drama series, Howard plays Lucious Lyon, the father to Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, across the show’s five seasons. Howard is the first “Empire” star to comment on his co-star’s arrest, while Fox said last Friday that Smollett would be removed from the final episodes of season five."

Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some “Empire” cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard’s post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know.

Howard, who plays Smollett's on-screen father, Lucious Lyon on the hit drama series, shared a video of the actor with a baby, alongside the following caption:

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you ♥️.”

A fan commented that Howard was supporting a ""lying felon,"" prompting the actor to expound as follows:

“The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” he said.

“His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years.""

""It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend!”

Howard's post and subsequent comment comes just days after Smollett was charged for filing a false police report.

The actor was forced to surrender his passport, keeping him in Chicago as the investigation is still ongoing into what actually transpired.

Fox stood by Jussie Smollett before he was charged, but the network later opted to oust the actor from the final two episodes of Empire Season 5.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" the statement read at the time.

""Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.""

Flynn'],https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/milk-shepard-smollett-4-ap-flickr-bnn.jpg,"['san', 'true', 'fake', 'motives', 'gay', 'milk', 'inspired', 'francisco', 'matt', 'shepard', 'matthew', 'crimes', 'victim', 'mckinney', 'smollett', 'hate', 'jussie']","Cancel the BOLO alert for red-capped racists braving the polar vortex on streets of Chicago in search of blacks and gays and black gays to victimize. It turns out that the same perpetrators who smeared feces on Tawana Brawley, drew that backwards swastika on Morton Downey, Jr., and gang raped Crystal Mangum also put that noose around the neck of Jussie Smollett.

“As Jussie Smollett Story Takes a Turn, Reaction Shifts to Wait and See” read the CNN headline on Monday. Reading between the lines one wonders why agnosticism prevailed only once two acquaintances of Smollett confessed to receiving payment from the Empire actor to stage the assault, which the faux assailants say they rehearsed with the faux victim. Strangely, the media and several politicians who incautiously drew conclusions without facts now advise wait-and-see as the damning facts mount and Cook County files charges. Does prudence really command us to put on the seatbelt only in the aftermath of the car crash?

A sensationalistic hate crime touted by the press only to eventually unravel feels familiar enough to condition Americans to receive such reports skeptically.

“Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night!” Yasmin Seweid wrote in late 2016 of a fabricated attack on her by inebriated Trump supporters calling her a terrorist and attempting to rip her hijab from her head on a packed Manhattan subway train. “What a traumatizing night.”

In 2017, a vandal signing a note “White America” smashed a window and lit a fire at a Charlotte, North Carolina, store run by an immigrant. The note read, “Our newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for white America.” Surveillance footage showed the vandal as a black man who turned out to oppose the president.

The organist copped to spray-painting “Heil Trump,” “Fag Church,” and a swastika on St. David’s Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom, Indiana. “I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good,” he confessed in 2017, “even if it was a false flag.”

Like Charlie Brown, we keep trying to kick that football. Part of falling for fake hate crimes, albeit temporarily, stems from falling for other fake hate crimes permanently. Several stories of martyrdom at the hands of bigots woven into our national fabric appear upon further inspection to be, well, fabricated. Unlike the Smollett case, these events involved real, horrific violence. But in the aftermath, ideologues used the tragedies for political purposes. This success in alchemizing propaganda into history inspired Jussie Smollett to increase his stature from wealthy primetime actor to victim.

Consider Harvey Milk, really murdered by a really disturbed former San Francisco supervisor in November of 1978. The notion that Dan White shot his former colleague because of his homosexuality led to Milk’s face on a postage stamp, his name on a Navy vessel, and his birthday celebrated as a state holiday in California public schools.

But his murderer, a protégé of Dianne Feinstein, attended the largest gay rights fundraiser in the history of the United States until that point. The San Francisco Democrat donated $100 to defeat the anti-gay Briggs Initiative and occasionally voted with Milk on gay rights matters before the board of supervisors. In an interview for my book Cult City: Jim Jones, Harvey Milk, and 10 Days That Shook San Francisco, Ray Sloan, who was White’s campaign manager, chief of staff, and business partner, rejected the idea that anti-gay animus motivated his boss. “That was never an issue,” Sloan told me of his own homosexuality. “In coordinating [White’s] campaign, I don’t think anyone knew or cared if I was gay. I neither hid it, but I wasn’t out participating in any way that would say that. I sort of lived my own life. As time went on, it was clear that [White] knew. It just didn’t make any difference to him.”

More recently, Matthew Shepard, barbarically murdered by two men in Laramie, Wyoming, in October of 1998, became a poster child for hate crimes. As with Milk, facts complicate the narrative.

Namely, “Matthew was part of an interstate meth-trafficking circle,” Stephen Jimenez writes in The Book of Matt, and “the buying and selling of crystal meth was only one of the activities he and [his murderer] Aaron [McKinney] shared.”

Law enforcement observed McKinney engaged in sexual acts with men on at least two occasions, a gay club’s bartender knew Shepard’s murderer as a hustler turning tricks with male patrons for cash, and various paramours attest to engaging in gay sex with him. One of those who engaged in sex with McKinney was his victim, Matthew Shepard.

“[A]aron screwed [M]att at least 5 times that I know of,” Ted Henson, who was so close to Shepard that Shepard’s parents presented him with a vial of his slain friend’s ashes, told the openly-gay Jimenez. “[M]att made me feel sorry for him a lot and I would do anything for [M]att. [S]o when [M]att would go get high, his payment to [A]aron was his ass, and [A]aron would only do it if [A]aron, [M]att, and I would have a 3 way together.”

Former Laramie police officer Flint Waters, who arrested Henderson, told the UK’s Guardian in 2014, “I believe to this day that McKinney and Henderson were trying to find Matthew’s house so they could steal his drugs. It was fairly well known in the Laramie community that McKinney wouldn’t be one that was striking out of a sense of homophobia. Some of the officers I worked with had caught him in a sexual act with another man, so it didn’t fit – none of that made any sense.”

But it made sense for those seeking to pass legislation to link the sympathetic victim to their causes. Gay friends of Shepard, upon hearing of the tragedy, immediately contacted the press and pressure organizations, which hitched the case to their push for hate-crimes legislation. The Laramie Project (a play and later a film) and other pop-culture dramatizations of the events similarly took artistic license in portraying the murders as the result of homophobia. The depiction stuck.

In court, where facts matter, the prosecutors in the Shepard and Milk murder trials did not allege that bigotry served as the motivation. But in the court of public opinion, homophobia is depicted as the alpha and omega explaining motive for both murders. That drugs and money catalyzed the murder of Shepard — just as a petty man nursing a petty grudge over losing a petty office explains the murder of Milk and the decidedly straight San Francisco Mayor George Moscone — neither negates the horrific manner of Shepard’s death nor the evil that motivated his murderers. It also does not erase the fact that truly bigoted people consumed by hate do go to murderous extremes.

The mischaracterization of these events does show the lengths to which ideologues go to impose a Manichean, ideologically-neat stamp on history. People do not want complicated human enemies. They want pure villains. This affirms the ideologue as noble and righteous.

And journalists rarely dare to question the conventional wisdom of such cases because the mob benefiting from the narrative immediately gangs up on the truth teller. Questioning wins one unflattering descriptives: racist, bigot, hater, homophobe, etc. Just as there are incentives to use tragedies for political purposes, there are disincentives to question narratives. So, false narratives often endure.

We ask: Why does the press buy hate crime hoaxes? It affirms them, seems the easy answer. A far more interesting question involves why individuals manufacture hate crime hoaxes. In Smollett’s case, one can perhaps point to the political reason of demonizing his enemies, or maybe the psychological one involving the former child actor’s thirst for attention, or, as the Chicago police allege, the mercenary reason of wanting a higher salary.

But beyond the specifics of this one case is the broader truth about our society that at some point the victim surpassed the hero, that sainthood status goes to the guy who gets something done to him rather than the guy who does something, that we began to desire to broadcast to the world not our goodness but the badness of the people we dislike. If you make race, gender, sexual orientation, and other victim categories your religion, then you begin to find yourself worshiping victims. A former child-actor seeking wider worship understood this.

The Jussie Smollett ordeal spotlights something unsettling about him. But it reveals something more disturbing about us.

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., not only believed black and openly gay actor Jussie Smollett’s tale of being attacked by two N-word-spouting homophobic Trump-supporters, she – and many other big-name Democrats – knew exactly whom to blame.

Waters said: “I know Jussie. I love him. His family’s a friend of mine. I know his sisters, I met his mom and I called already to Jazz, one of the sisters, to talk to her about what’s happening, what’s going on. … I’m pleased that he’s doing OK. But we have to understand this is happening for a reason. Why, all of a sudden, do we have people unable to study while black, unable to mow a lawn while black, unable to have a picnic while black, and being attacked? It’s coming from the President of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he is basically emboldening those folks who feel this way.”

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who became famous by falsely accusing an assistant district attorney of raping a black teenage girl, weighed in. He said: “(The Smollett attack) is only a reminder of the times that we are living in, that people feel empowered to express their hate and feel there will be no accountability. … The President should have said, ‘My brand shouldn’t stand for that.’ This hate-filled climate is set by … the President of the United States, who gets the award for climate setting, if he is not at fault for a direct act.”

The Rev. Jesse Jackson released a statement: “Hatred against another simply because of who they are is like acid rain. It falls from the top down and pollutes the environment.” Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: “What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts.” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in a tweet, called the alleged attack “a modern day lynching.”

Isn’t it good news that the story is false? Isn’t it good news that Trump-supporting goons are not patrolling the streets at night, armed with bleach and a noose, to find, attack, whitewash and lynch black and gay Trump-bashers? A PeopleTV host actually said she was “hoping” and “praying” that Smollett’s story was true.

Why did so many uncritically buy Smollett’s story? One reason is that an Axios poll last November found that 61% of Democrats believe Republicans are “racist/ bigoted/sexist.” And 31% of Republicans feel that way about Democrats. Most Democrats and members of the media believe Trump is a racist. So why doubt such a juicy story that falsely advances two narratives? Trump is Exhibit A that racism remains a major problem in America. And if Trump is a “racist,” therefore so are his supporters.

But what does it say about America’s alleged “systemic,” “structural” and “institutional” racism when, in 2019, the cupboard is so bare that “racist attacks” have to be manufactured? Last year, in a span of a few weeks, three black motorists claimed they were victims of racism by the white cops who pulled them over. One, a reverend, was the president of a local branch of the NAACP. He posted on social media a long, detailed description of the alleged interaction with the cop whom he claimed racially profiled him and made harassing comments. A black female motorist took to social media to say she had a “traumatic experience” in Virginia when she was pulled over for speeding and “threatened” by a “white cop,” who “degraded” her “as an African-American.” And a viral post by a civil rights “activist” claimed a Texas trooper sexually assaulted another black woman following a traffic stop and then arrested her for DUI.

But they were all unaware that they were being recorded. The tapes show all three were lying. The cops involved were courteous, polite and respectful. The black motorists lied about the white cops. But if not for the recordings, who knows what might have happened to the careers of the officers.

As to the belief that racism remains a serious problem in America, can we agree that nirvana is not an option? In a nation of 330 million people, bad actors abound. After all, one survey in 2017 found that 7% of adult Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows. That works out to over 17 million adults. And a 1997 Gallup poll found that 4% of Americans believed Elvis was still alive.

But today’s definition of “race relations” pretty much comes down to this: how black people feel about white people and how white people feel about how black people feel about white people. Racism has so receded as an impediment to progress that new terms became necessary to describe offensive “racist” behaviour, such as “microaggressions.” This means whites are racist, even if they don’t think they are, because of their “white privilege.” If white people spent as much time thinking about how to oppress black people as black people think they do, white people wouldn’t have enough time to oppress black people.

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Jussie Smollett's character on ""Empire,"" has expressed support for his fellow cast member amid allegations that Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.""

Evidence has been revealed that disputes this claim.

TMZ reports that police have uncovered a check dated Jan. 23rd for $3,500 that was not for the attack as suspected, but for personal training sessions. On the memo line of the check it reads “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go” and it was made out to Abel, who Smollett calls “Bon.” The Osundario brothers recently testified in front of a grand jury saying the $3,500 was for training as well. “Don’t Go” is one of Smollett’s songs that he was going to shoot a music video for. The training sessions were supposed to help him lose 20 pounds so he could be shirtless in the visual.

Text messages were also discovered that support this evidence. Their message thread shows that Abel detailed a meal plan for Smollett and reminded him to work out while traveling. The messages show that the Empire star has paid Abel’s brother Ola for his services in the past as well. Sources told TMZ that the $3,500 covered a $600-a-week exercise plan and the $100 fee for the meal plan. There is also a text message confirming that “Don’t Go” was going to be filmed February 23rd.

This doesn’t prove that Smollett didn’t stage the attack but it will be used if this case goes to trial.

The 36-year-old actor turned himself into authorities last week and was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report."

One social media user, among Howard's many critics, slammed him for supporting ""a lying felon."" They accused him of being a ""typical liberal hypocrite"" and announced that the actor has lost all the respect they may have held for him in the past. Terrence responded to the criticism with firm kindness.

Unfortunately, the week that was Sunday, February 17th through Sunday afternoon, didn't allow for much respite. Just as the murmurs of a ""Gucci boycott"" began quieting down, 50 Cent's entire being and Universe was suddenly turned upside down - by news of an alleged NYPD-sponsored bounty on his head.

Cindy Ord/Getty Images

To my surprise, Fif played it off as if he were completely unaffected. Personally-speaking, the thought of NYPD underlings running defiantly with a ""shoot on sight"" directive, sends shivers down my spine, and I'm standing safely out of bounds.

50 Cent wound up using the alleged bounty to sell one of his cable network TV shows, what else? Then he picked an indiscriminate fight with a public figure who'd seen his fortunes reversed in the span of a week. And then it happened again: 50 Cent, with all the insolence he could muster, fell trap to a fake ""Kanye West"" news alert floating in negligible space.

As the weeks turn to months, the pattern in which 50 Cent operates on social media has become easy to discern. If and when 50 believes he's overstepped his bounds, or liable to lose a zero-sum contest, he simply powers forward like nothing ever happened. So, how did he fare in a week where ""impartiality"" looked unfathomable, even for the Mr. Rogers of the neighborhood? Let's find out by first looking into this ""The Oath"" he imparted on NYPD's internal affairs.

THE CROOKED COP CRUSADES.

To quote Jay-Z, who once famously bickered over the value of a 50 Cent cent coin, ""Crooked officer, crooked officer! Why you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?"" While no relation exists between 50 Cent and Jay-Z's questioning of law enforcement in 2008, the lyrics resonate to this day, especially with regards to Emanuel Gonzalez, the commanding officer who ordered the halfwit bounty on 50 Cent's head.

It's been reported ad nauseam, and yes: Emanuel Gonzalez urged his underlings to ""shoot him on sight,"" because he and 50 have a history of taking jabs at one another. It was after all Gonzalez with whom the NYPD entrusted with the crackdown on 50 Cent's ""Get the Strap"" slogan. The NYPD feared the popular expressive could incite violence through its perceived lethal connotations, and pervasive appeal on the Internet.

As a result of the crackdown, legions of 50 Cent fans started harassing Gonzalez and his constituents at any given opportunity. It formed the basis of a contentious relationship with real-life consequences. Fortunately for 50 Cent, an NYPD-sponsored audit into Gonzalez' actions, and a wee bit of insubordination helped swing the pendulum in his favor.

Had Emanuel Gonzalez taken the bait, and responded to any of 50 Cent's insults at such a crucial moment, the disgraced officer may have been liable to further punishment. That alone would have given 50 Cent the impetus to spend all his waking hours administering ""cheap shots,"" as much as he could muster with Gonzalez couched in the NYPD doghouse.

THE SELF-PROFESSED ""GAY TUPAC"" INCARNATE TAKES A WALLOPING.

Elsewhere on the docket, 50 Cent picked a one-sided fight with Jussie Smollett, the disenfranchised Empire actor whose every bespoken action has become an article of mass consumption. The Jussie Smollett story needs little introduction; the Chicago PD have evidence negating the hate crimes that he reported, and that's just the beginning of the sordid mess.

50 Cent was evidently preying upon the very same ""sensational elements"" which have pitted Smollett against a host public figures with their own agenda and cause. 50 Cent revived interest in the scandal by reposting the meme that pokes fun at Smollett's self-immolation as the ""Gay Tupac"" incarnate of our era - comments he made during a concert shortly after the staged ""attack.""

As is normally the custom, 50 Cent filed his response to Smollett, on Instagram, where a doctored cover shot of 2Pac's All Eyez on Me with a superimposed ""Jussie"" smile lie in wait.

""It’s 2019 people,things are a little different now. Commander Emanuel Gonzalez would say, if you see him shoot him on sight,"" wrote 50 cent, as the caption to the uncredited oeuvre.

KANYE WEST AT THE CHARITY STRIPE.

Unfortunately, 50 Cent didn't fare quite as well, when he embarked on a smear campaign with Kanye West as his target. It all occurred so unsuspectingly: 50 Cent was scouring the social media feed like any other hoople, when a headline reading ""Kanye West Scores 126 Points Against Wheelchair Basketball Team"" popped up on his radar.

Of course, the fake ""Kanye West"" news alert was uploaded under a heavily doctored thumbnail - so fake, that even an amateur MS Paint enthusiast such as 50 Cent would spot the difference. But in this instance, an 50 Cent figures he'd make a lewd joke, for no other reason but to sublimate his depleting serotonin levels for well-earned pick me up.

Had 50 Cent not reposted it the Kanye meme/headline, its urban mythology would have sunk like Waldo in a sea of clones, but he didn't and the story gained a whole lot of unnecessary traction.

Otherwise, the week was like any other for 50 Cent: he bickered with Teairra Marí, she bickered back. Her insistence being: Tekashi 6ix9ine distilled his snitchy ways by associating with the Jamaica, Queens rapper. Marí was the Queen of the ROc for a brief moment after Amil stepped out of the limelight, and now she and 50 Cent are reduced to squabbling over tater tots the shape of a $."

Jussie Smollett doesn’t have a ton of defenders right now, but he’s not entirely alone. On Wednesday, the Empire actor was arrested by Chicago PD, who accused him of filing a false police report involving the attack he claimed was a hate crime. Many who once supported his claims have since turned on him. Someone who hasn’t is his onscreen father, Terrence Howard.

On Friday, TMZ claimed that many on staff at Empire were demanding he be fired. So far his character will “only” be removed from the rest of the season. Howard, apparently, isn’t ready to go that far. And he took to Instagram to show his support of the embattled actor.



At first Howard kept it simple. He posted a video of Smollett playing with a baby, with the caption, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you ♥️.”

Howard’s support was criticized and challenged in the comments, prompting Howard to elaborate. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” Howard replied. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a real friend!”

Smollett has continued to assert his innocence, as have his lawyers. If convicted of disorderly conduct in filing a false police report, he could face up to three years in prison.

TMZ reports that texts between Smollett and the Nigerian-American brothers accused of being is co-conspirators in the alleged hate crime show that the $3500 check at the center of the case was indeed for fitness training, and not payment for the attack.

Abel and Ola Osundairo have been aiding investigators with making sense of the alleged racist and homophobic attack that Smollett claims went down in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 in Chicago.

The brothers reportedly told police that Smollett gave them the check six days before the attack, and while he didn’t specifically say that the money was payment to stage an attack, the brothers claim it was understood what the check was for.

However, sources connected to the Empire star maintain that Smollett paid for five weeks of training and a meal plan. The actor/singer wanted to help get his body in shape for a new music video. According to TMZ, the memo line reads, “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.”

The artist was going to go shirtless in the video for his new song “Don’t Go.” But Smollett needed to lose 20 pounds before the shoot, which is why he hired Abel (AKA “Bon”).

According to TMZ, various texts between the two men starting from January 20 to January 28 -the day before the “attack”- all mention Smollett’s weight loss plans.

“I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.” Bon wrote in one message

Another text outlines a meal plan for the day and a text on January 25 reads, “This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.”

Sources connected to case say the $3500 breaks down as follows: $600 a week for a 5-week workout plan and $100 a week for a five-week nutrition plan.

After investigators pieced together texts messages between the actor and the brothers, as well as CCTV and ride-shares, police uncovered evidence that they said showed that Smollett orchestrated the attack on himself.

Smollett was charged last week with filling a false police report after claiming two men hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck. But Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson claims the entertainer staged the hoax attack as part of a “publicity stunt…to promote his career.”"

The actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Jussie Smollett’s character on Empire, has expressed support for his fellow cast member amid allegations that Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox TV series, used Instagram to post a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: “All your lil homies got you … We love the hell outta you.”

Answering a critic, he wrote that the Smollett he knew “could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly”.

The post came a day after Empire producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set”.

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns on 13 March with nine episodes. Seven were completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck.

Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some Empire cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

""I look up to you Terence,"" he writes. ""You have to take a leadership position. And denounce this (expletive). Otherwise you as dumb as he is. Period!""

TMZ reports that Smollett may have picked up the notion of faking the attack from Empire creator Lee Daniels, who posted a Jan. 10 Instagram video condemning homophobia and talking about a recent anti-gay attack on his cousin. Sources close to the show say Lee talked more about the ordeal on set, leaving everyone upset and possibly giving Smollett the idea.

Smollett also narrated a documentary series in May 2018 called America Divided that looks at hate crimes, particularly lynching, notes the Chicago Tribune.

Chicago — American advocacy groups and police have a shared concern over the fallout from allegations that a TV actor faked a hate-motivated assault: that future victims will face more skepticism even as hate crimes are on the rise.



Chicago police have accused Jussie Smollett of engineering an elaborate hoax to exploit Americans' anxieties over political and racial divisions in order to generate publicity and a bigger paycheck.



The 36-year-old star of the Fox drama ""Empire"" allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make American Great Again"" slogan.



Smollett is charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was freed Thursday on $100,000 bond.



""If true, then this is a disgraceful exploitation of many past victims of real hate crimes, many of whom have endured heinous suffering,"" Kami Chavis, a former assistant US attorney in the George W Bush administration, told AFP.



The actor's lawyers, in a defiant statement, criticized law enforcement's actions as an organized ""spectacle"" and maintained Smollett's innocence.



But whatever the final result, the case has left gay rights and racial justice advocates, along with politicians and government officials, worried about future victims. Will they be believed?



""Bogus police reports cause real harm,"" an angry Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson told a news conference Thursday, after detailing what his detectives learned over a three-week investigation.



""My concern is that hate crimes will now publically be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen,"" Johnson said.



The initial news of the purported attack at the end of January generated an outpouring of support for Smollett, who in the past has lent his celebrity to gay rights, racial equality and other causes. — AFP

Smollett had opposers and supporters fighting to find the truth about whether he had been attacked or not. Nevertheless, Smollett was indicted for disorderly conduct after allegedly staging a hate crime and filing a false report.

Chicago Chief of Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a press conference, “This announcement today recognized ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

While Smollett was disappointed in making $65,000 an episode—a rich person problem—we can’t ignore the fact that he could possibly face time in prison for a lie. Unfortunately, the money he does have might not save him because of his race and sexuality.

I do not agree with Smollett because he used his platform to lie instead of using his platform to help people who actually go through this stuff everyday. He lost a part of being an ally in his own communities.

I still don’t believe he should go to prison.

In this day and age, race is brought up a lot. It is important to recognize that if Smollett were a white, straight man or woman, I promise he wouldn’t be in the situation he’s in now.

Emmett Till’s murderers were let go when Carolyn Bryant lied and said Till grabbed her and was sexaully crude to her, which she has since confessed was not true.

Lamonte Mcintyre was falsely imprisoned when KCKPD Detective Roger Golubski used his power to place him at the scene of a crime, despite the fact that no direct evidence linked Mcintire to the crime.

The president of the United State lies everyday about major issues that eventually lead to his administration caging children.

None of these white people listed above have ever been arrested or in prison, but that is the privilege of being white and straight. There are murders and rapists out there that are still not in prison, but a celebrity might be because of a lie.

If Smollett is imprisoned, it will show that the justice system stooped down to his level for something petty, while failing to get the true criminals.

Smollett’s lie shouldn’t get him in prison. His punishment will come through the communities he failed, his job and the people who trusted him. That punishment will be harder to live with than prison.

I don’t believe this is the end for Smollett. Like many failed celebrities, he will write a book, then an Oscar-winning movie will come from it and he will be on ‘Dancing With The Stars’ to get famous again.

But prison should not be in his future. However, I do doubt that he will be free because of his race and sexuality. Prison is on it’s way.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.""

The post on Saturday came a day after ""Empire"" producers announced that Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move ""to avoid further disruption on the set.""

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend's brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some ""Empire"" cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard's post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: ""sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I've called my son for 5 years. It's God's job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There's nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.""

TMZ reports that the Jussie wrote it to Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo some days before the staged attack in Chicago.

In the cheque, a particular line states, “5-week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.”

TMZ equally mentioned that Jussie paid for a five-week workout program which was charged at $600 a week, and then, another $100 weekly due for a five-week nutrition program. These bring his charges to the $3500 cheque he issued to the Nigerian brothers.

Furthermore, Jussie made a $100 Venmo payment last September for another “training”, supposedly because he needed to lose 20 pounds so that he could be fit for his shoot.

Some other screenshots of text messages shared between Jussie and one of the Nigerians reveals how he was being reminded to not skip his cardio nor avoid his nutrition plan.

In an Instagram video shared Sunday, Howard calls back on a lighter time in their lives, when the two actors were traveling together with Howard’s family. In the video, Smollett is seen playing with Howard’s son, Hero, as they sit aboard a private plane. He tickles the young baby, who squeals and giggles with delight as he nuzzles into Smollett’s chest.

“Aw, such a sweet baby,” Smollett says as he smiles to the camera.

In the caption for the post, Howard, who plays Smollett’s TV dad, extends his love and support. “All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,” he wrote with a heart emoji.

It’s been a whirlwind last couple of weeks for those following Smollett’s story after the actor and singer went from being the supposed victim of a brutal attack, to the suspected mastermind behind it. Smollett, who is black and gay, first came forward in late January with an elaborate story detailing how two men attacked him while using racial and homophobic slurs. He claims they tied a noose around his neck before pouring a substance he thought was bleach on him and bolting from the scene.

Police initially treated the incident as a potential hate crime and brought two men into custody for questioning. But soon a flurry of news reports citing unnamed sources cast doubt on Smollett’s story, suggesting that he was somehow the one pulling the strings. Smollett defended himself on national television, delivering a play-by-play of his alleged attack, while adding that he was “pissed off” by critics who refused to believe his story. But within days, Smollett became the focus of the investigation.

Police on Thursday arrested Smollett and charged him for allegedly filing a false police report. Authorities say he paid two men $3,500 to fake the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” Police also suspect that he sent himself a threatening letter prior to the attack and was disappointed with the lack of response.

Smollett, however, continues to maintain his innocence. He’s since been written off of Empire and producers say he won’t appear again for the rest of the season. In a message to his colleagues on the cast after he was released from bail, Smollett reportedly begged them for support: “I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Howard has been one of the few prominent figures to continue to defend Smollett. In the comment section of his Instagram post Sunday, Howard called out critics who pressed him to denounce Smollett, writing: “Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know. The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”"

When I opened his text I saw no words, only a picture. It was a photoshopped edit of Smollett’s anxious face sitting behind the wheel of O.J. Simpson’s white Ford Bronco as a column of police squad cars trailed behind him.

The photo was a riff on Simpson’s infamous 1994 low-speed chase. The doctored image became a social media meme after Smollett was arrested by police this week for allegedly faking a racist hate crime against himself.

But there is another parallel between Smollett and Simpson that hardly anyone is talking about.

Simpson was able to rally support for himself during and after his murder trial by “deciding to become a black man.” He attended black churches for support, huddled with civil right activists, said he was a victim of a racist conspiracy — he did everything but don a dashiki.

Smollett, too, has claimed he is a victim of white racism and gained initial support from black leaders. But in a new era where Donald Trump is in the Oval Office, Bill Cosby is in jail and R&B singer R. Kelly is headed to court, Smollett may soon learn that the rules have changed for black celebrities caught in deep legal trouble.

He may discover that his race card has expired.

There was a time when the black community gave unconditional support to black public figures who invoked racism, but Smollett’s case is already showing how that script is being rewritten.

Blacks are becoming more savvy about the difference between “authentic blackness” and “strategic blackness,” says Tanya Hernandez, a professor at Fordham University’s School of Law in New York City.

“The contemporary Trump world means we don’t have the luxury to be uncritical about who gets our communal love and support,” says Hernandez, author of “Multiracials and Civil Rights: Mixed-Race Stories of Discrimination.”

Hernandez says the black community and its allies cannot continue “to carry brothers who act in ways that call into question the existence of real violence and bias.”

“We are literally being killed,” she says, “and there is no room to carry parasites.”

Doubling-down on blackness

There’s an inside joke in the black community that we’ll forgive anything as long as an embattled black public figure follows a well-worn script. I’ve seen it in action. I’ve felt its tug.

I was living in Washington, D.C., when Marion Barry, a former civil rights activist, was caught on film smoking crack with a prostitute — while he was the city’s mayor. When the FBI crashed into a hotel room to nab him in the act, Barry uttered the line that would follow him the rest of his life: “B—- set me up!“

Barry, though, had a Plan B — he played that race card.

He started saying he was a victim of a racist media, once said his accusers were trying to “lynch” him, and began wearing Afrocentric garb. It worked. He resurrected his political career after many of his black supporters forgave him. And he won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.

I’ve seen this story play out time and time again. I get the impulse. Barry, for example, was more than his flaws. He risked his life for racial progress. Not many people can say that. Some of us black folks figured that we, not white people, get to decide who our leaders are.

Yet this attitude can lead to some surreal situations when black public figures who rarely seemed like allies suddenly discover their inner-Black Lives Matter when their careers falter or they face legal trouble.

Remember Michael Jackson?

The late pop star’s relationship to his blackness was so ambiguous that you could literally see it in his face. But he, too, doubled-down on his blackness when times got tough.

When he began to feud with his record labels and his album sales declined, he teamed up with civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton and the late attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. and charged the recording industry with stealing from black artists. He accused a record company chairman of using the n-word. He even briefly aligned himself with the Nation of Islam, a black separatist religious group.

Even Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas played up his racial victimization after he was accused of sexual harassment. Thomas had spent much of his life lecturing blacks about not thinking of themselves as victims of racism. But when his nomination to the high court faltered, he declared that he was the victim of a “high-tech lynching,” a rhetorical move that put his critics on the defensive.

Of course, to say this behavior is confined to black people would be wrong. And in many cases brown and black people are right when they claim racism. We’ve seen plenty of videos to back that up in recent years.

But all sorts of groups use their version of the race card.

“When the walls are closing in on you, you will use every tool you can. Black folk are no different,” says Wes Jackson, founder and executive director of the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival.

“Knowing that the boot of white supremacy and the invisible hand is always on your neck, some claim it when they need a pass. Others ignore it when it gets them into country clubs and galas. No different than a sinner seeing Jesus once the judge bangs the gavel.”

There’s another reason why the race card never seems to expire. There’s been a tradition in the black community of not airing our dirty laundry. We’re not supposed to criticize our public figures. Like athletes on professional teams, we’re supposed to keep our mess in-house.

I remember what happened when I crossed that line. After I wrote a story critical of a black leader, I received an email from a famous black writer who had befriended and mentored me. It read: “That was a houseboy article you wrote. I bet your white editors are glad.”

We never spoke again.

When you lose Charles Barkley, you’ve lost Black America

Yet now we’re in an era when we’re so disturbed about so much real racism our tolerance for fakery is getting thin.

This is a challenge Smollett faces.

It may help that he has never tried to distance himself from his black identity. Though he is biracial, he has talked proudly about his heritage and is known for speaking out on racial as well as gay and lesbian issues.

But that’s not helping him much right now. It’s striking how quickly so many black figures are starting to question him.

The rapper Cardi B said Smollett “f—ed up Black History Month” and that she’s “disappointed” in him.

Sharpton said Smollett should face “accountability to the maximum” if it’s discovered that he was lying about the alleged attack.

The black filmmaker Tyler Perry said he was “lost for words” after hearing about Smollett’s arrest and that “to stoke fears and raise racial tensions is wrong.”

NBA Insider host Charles Barkley’s savage riff on Smollett went viral. (“If you’re gonna break the law, do not write a check. Get cash, man.”)

This willingness to take on black figures is bigger than Smollett. You can see it in the changing fortunes of two other black celebrities: Cosby and R. Kelly.

The beginning of the end for Cosby started with a public attack not by a white racist — but by a black comedian, Hannibal Buress, who called him a rapist.

One of the first people to go after R. Kelly about his alleged mistreatment of underage women was not a white prosecutor — it was another black comedian, Dave Chappelle, in his famous “Piss on You” video. Kelly was indicted Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims in Chicago. Kelly has denied the allegations against him.

Hernandez, the Fordham law professor, says this shift started years ago with Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, the woman who accused him of sexual harassment — an accusation Thomas denied. Black leaders criticized black women who supported Hill. Then the black community watched as Thomas “stabbed us in the back” by aligning with anti-black conservative Supreme Court justices, Hernandez says.

“Cosby and R. Kelly don’t get to take black love for granted because we learned a hard lesson with CT,” Hernandez says.

There’s another reason black people seem more willing to openly criticize those who play the race card — a change in the media landscape.

Jenn M. Jackson, a black queer feminist and activist says there’s always been vigorous debate in the black community about our leaders.

What’s different now is that so many more voices can be heard, she says.

“What we do see now is that we have platforms to allow that critique to bubble up, and we have now more visibility,” she says. “We have more people who have podcasts, we have Black Twitter, so now when they make a critique people are listening.”

People like Smollett can’t just don some Afrocentric clothing and invoke vague racial conspiracies to get the black community behind them anymore.

More black people are seeing this truth:

When we unconditionally protect every black public figure, we sometimes end up doing something far more damaging — not protecting the people in our community who need it the most.

“People are willing to be truthful and real and say, ‘Yes this person looks like us, but we’re going to call it out because it needs to be called out,'” says Jeffrey Gardere, a commentator and psychologist who teaches at Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in New York City.

“We’re not going to coddle, hide, we’re not going to ignore anymore. You see that with the allegations against R. Kelly.”

Smollett’s path to redemption?

If the O.J. approach doesn’t work as well, where does that leave Smollett?

There is one group even more marginalized than blacks or the LBGQT community.

Gardere says if it is proven that Smollett staged a hoax, he won’t be angry or disappointed. He would be concerned as a psychologist that Smollett would do something so self-destructive and bizarre.

“It would speak to maybe severe emotional trauma and other issues that have never been truly addressed,” Gardere says.

Smollett’s story has veered from discussions about race, sexual orientation and politics. But if it’s true that he perpetuated a hoax, Smollett may be able to get the black community and others to rally behind him by talking about another subject, Gardere says.

“Even throughout this bizarre thing, he’s made a lot of positive and very intelligent statements about being African-American and being part of the LGBTQ community, Gardere says. “But he may have to bring a third part into this, and that is the importance of mental health. Maybe that will get him, if he did this thing, the proper redemption.”

Stay tuned. There may be more twists in Smollett’s story in the months ahead. But we can be assured of one thing: The next time a black celebrity tries to get out of a jam by playing the race card, the black community won’t simply respond with unconditional support.

Instead they may send him or her a new message:

Your race card has been declined."

Now streaming on Netflix, the action-packed film follows four black Vietnam War veterans—Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.)— as they reunite at the Ho Chi Minh City Hotel and embark on a mission to bring home the remains of their fallen brother and squad leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman) along with a golden hidden treasure secured for them.

Based on an original screenplay by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo, Da 5 Bloods touches on the realities many Black Vietnam veterans of the '70s experienced upon their return home of civil injustice—from post-traumatic stress disorder to systemic racism to being called “baby killers” despite being drafted by the U.S. military against their will.

Lee and his production company 40 Acres and a Mule joined forces with fellow scriber Kevin Willmott (BlacKkKlansman), composer Terence Blanchard (BlacKkKlansman), and Netflix producers Lloyd Levin, Beatriz Levin, Jon Kilik to bring the Da 5 Bloods to life.

Ahead of the film's premiere, VIBE correspondent/host Jazzie Belle sat down with Lee and the cast—including Jonathan Majors who plays Lindo’s son, David— to discuss the uncomfortable significance of the MAGA hat, the deep-seated brotherly love between their characters, and what they hope viewers can take away from the film.

""Communicate with each other. This movie is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Whitlock, Jr. ""Hope. Learn your history and hope,"" added Lewis. ""Make sure this isn't just one chapter of your history that you know,"" pointed out Peters. ""Now, use this as the portal to everything else over the past hundred years, the good and the bad. The successes of the scientists, the mathematicians, the inventors, as well as the atrocities. There's a huge disparity in all of that stuff. And America would not be America without us.""

On whether the constant telling or our Black stories in films is retraumatizing or cathartic

Lee: It's a combination of both. It's not one or the other. As Black people, we go through some sh*t, good and bad. (laughs) It's hard, but here's the thing though. It's been hard from day one. 1619, our ancestors. That first ship landed in Jamestown, Virginia. It's never been easier. It's been getting easier, you might say, but it's never been easy from the get-go.

On whether Kanye's support of Donald Trump and the MAGA hat

Lee: This really had nothing to do with our brother. I mean he's not the only one that has drunk from the orange pitcher of Kool-aid. There's a very small percentage. We point out that Black guy's behind Trump at every rally hold up a sign [saying] ""Black for Kanye,"" so it's not just our brother Kanye...and also story-wise, character-wise, it really injects some tension between [the people of] the group. Because when you're in a war with somebody, that bond is like that. It's going to take some really extra stuff to see an issue come up where they're not on the same page.

On whether who has become more woke in the midst of today's protests

Lee: I think we've been woke as the new terminology is. I think what's happening is our white brothers and sisters are getting woke. I think that's the biggest difference. L.A. is a great great great example of that....and that's always been a thing. In many of our great writers [like] James Baldwin and I can't name them all, have said it is not the responsibility of black people to fix racism. That don't make no goddamn sense.

Delroy Lindo and Jonathan Majors

On the apprehension behind associating the MAGA hat with his character in the film

Lindo: The Trumpian piece, that was the only piece I was hesitant about. It was never, ""Spike, I don't want to play this part."" It was always about, for my initial response was, ""Spike, can we change this? Can we change that aspect? Can I be a conservative? Can I be an arch-conservative?"" I don't want to be this with that hat and all. And Spike needed it. Ultimately, he needed that component I'm the film. I respected that and I was able to get past it. It was never a question of me not wanting to be a part of this because I absolutely did. I just wanted initially to change that component. In retrospect, that component needed to be there. There were certain times when it was quite uncomfortable, but once I rationalized it in my head, it was a part of what was a number of other parts in the characteristics of this character that were brilliant to negotiate and engage.

On the lesson learned while working on set with Lee and the cast

Majors: It was a moment of listening, of being very quiet and listening and also knowing your cue and knowing when there is a void here for whatever reason. And usually, when you look around and say something is missing, it's because you're the one that's supposed to be feeling that. What I gathered from listening, was a great deal of experience. It's so interesting as an actor because we feel things and so to be opposite people who are also feelers, who also really, really, throw punches—no one's pulling punches, when they say it, they mean it. And to listen and feel that then and then go, ""There's the void. Oh, my turn,"" boom The confidence after leaving this project...I left this project and then went to work on my TV show. I had just come from wrestling and working and training at one of the toughest gyms in cinema. I was like, ""Oh, let's go. I'm ready for this.""

Norm Lewis, Clarke Peters, and Isiah Whitlock Jr.

On the importance of seeing camaraderie among Black men on film

Peters: I think it's extremely important. It is as important as you breathing. If Black men don't try to find a way to love each other, we might as well go ahead and give ourselves up, really. Because I grew up in the '60s where there was this ""flower power"" peace love kind of thing, that has stayed within me, you know? I love these brothers off the film as well. I think that it is important for the youth to see that and for the older brother to be reminded of that because they were doing it back in the day themselves, they just forgot. Don't let this world stifle your love.

On how different it was to work with Spike Lee on this film versus the others

Whitlock Jr.: This is about the 6th film I've done with Spike, so I've gotten to know Spike. I know how he works. I've grown comfortable working with him. I don't bring the anxiety like I brought with the first couple of films. I'll never forget when I first started working with him, he said: ""You just gotta relax and do your thing."" When he walked away, I said to myself, ""Do my thing. I didn't even know I had a thing."" (laughs) But I better find it quickly. Well, I found my thing and I keep doing my thing. Basically what he was saying was look, just be yourself and bring that quality to the film which is why you're here. I love working with him, I hope it's not the last time.

On how he landed the role as Eddie after Spike shared the film's script with him

Lewis: I stay up until four in the morning, reading the script. He called me the next day and said, ""Let's go have dinner."" We had dinner, talked about the script. Still no offer or anything like that. He's like, ""What do you think?"" I loved the script. I said, ""It's great. Congratulations, I hope that this goes forward."" (laughs) And then he said, ""What do you think about Eddie?""... ""Eddie's a great character. Listen, congratulations. Keep going forward, I hope this works for you."" He says, ""I want you to play Eddie."" Oh, thank God. There was some point to this whole thing and so from that, it was just so exciting and getting to know I was going to do a Spike Lee joint. Reading the script and [knowing] that it was a departure from what he had done before. I mean there's still a lot of the same elements, being that it's an action-packed film. The fact that I was going to go to Thailand and do this...all these great people that I'd admired for years. It was just brilliant.

Blacks and others stage phony so-called ""hate crimes,"" cry racism and push for ridiculous ""anti-lynching"" laws. They act as if whites are judging, harassing, raping and killing blacks, when it's the other way around. If anything, it's blacks and liberal media and politicians declaring whites guilty until proven innocent – and even afterward they still call whites ""racist.""

Did it start with Tawana Brawley's false rape allegations against six white men, including at least one white police officer? She had the so-called ""N-word,"" ""b**ch,"" and ""KKK"" written upside-down on her torso in charcoal, with what turned out to be a neighbor's dog feces smeared on her. The case, from way back in 1987-88, was publicized by known race hustler and Brawley's advisor Al Sharpton. Under evil men like Louis Farrakhan, the blacks carried on, marched in the streets and cried ""racism.""

After it came out that Brawley lied, there was no apology, and nothing happened to the girl or her family. The mother, charged with contempt of court, evaded arrest because authorities feared possible violence.

Remember the Duke lacrosse case in 2006, in which a black stripper falsely accused white university athletes of ""raping"" her? It was all a lie, but no one came out and apologized to white people.

Recently, this radical black homosexual Jussie Smollett accused white people of a so-called ""racist and homophobic"" attack in Chicago. Now the ""Empire"" actor and social justice warrior is charged with filing a false police report. He's still trashing the police.

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

The wicked witch Kamala Harris, and the weak beta male Cory Booker, called the alleged attack an ""attempted modern-day lynching"" – with no evidence. (What's wrong with Republican Sen. Tim Scott that he'd join forces with such evil people to push a silly ""anti-lynching"" bill?) These black Democrats want to lynch white people – they don't believe in due process for whites! Even now that it's an apparent hoax, Kamala is still attacking imaginary ""racism"" and ""homophobia.""

I guarantee there will be no apology.

A watchdog group has documented incident after incident of blacks and others, who've been allowed into white schools, staging ""hate crime"" hoaxes against whites. Black male and female students paint so-called ""racial slurs.""

Black Lives Matter riots and cop-killings were based on lies such as Michael Brown's false ""hands-up, don't shoot."" Former Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Brown in self-defense, lost his job, went into hiding, and couldn't even be around black people. Stupid activists called him ""racist.""

Colin Kaepernick turned his back on the flag and the country – refusing to stand for the National Anthem. Kaepernick falsely accused police of murdering ""people of color"" and ""getting away with it."" Around the country, black kids with failing parents followed his bad example – along with other black athletes. But the weak NFL owners and pathetic NFL commissioner Roger Goodell kissed up to the thuggish black players, for fear of being called ""racist.""

Order Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson's book, ""The Antidote: Healing America from the Poison of Hate, Blame, and Victimhood.""

Only President Trump called out the disrespectful black players. He wished an NFL owner would say, ""Get that son-of-a-b**ch off the field right now. Out! He's fired!"" Donald Trump speaks with the love and authority of a good father – something most blacks never had.

Why are whites not creating a loud outcry, demanding an apology from these blacks, politicians and media constantly lying about ""racism""? For decades, whites have sat back in fear and false guilt, pandering, appeasing and being quiet while blacks go out-of-control. Most blacks hate white people – for no reason. Blacks' hatred started in the homes, with their own failing parents, angry mothers and weak or absent fathers. And whites' cowardice is also from weak fathers and angry mothers – false notions of being ""nice"" and letting evil continue. But fear and anger are the same – no matter the race.

It's no wonder younger whites are growing angry, some of them turning to the alt-right. Many in the alt-right, as well as many white ""conservatives,"" have turned to hate, blame and victimhood – destroying their lives as a result. People think anger is strength, but it's not – anger is evil. It makes you do things you regret later.

Anytime whites lash out in anger, the children of the lie celebrate, saying, ""See? Whites are racist!"" They want you demoralized and angry, because then they can control you. They can take away your freedoms and rights, your guns, and put you in jail.

This will only get worse. The government wants a race war, especially the Democrats. I'm very concerned because they are bringing in illegal aliens and people of color who hate white people, and whites are becoming a minority. Then we'll have what's happening in South Africa coming here, with whites' property and lives being taken with no recourse.

People's hearts must change in order for this to stop. But only God changes the heart. I recommend people commit to prayer, and face their parents and forgive them. Drop anger and speak up, so that you can get your courage back."

His acting skills are impeccable. His musical skills are undeniable.

What many don’t talk about is the mother that got him there. Many don’t talk about the struggle it took to get there and the hard work and diligence that she had to put in to ensure that he made it there, despite his early diagnosis of ADHD.

The stellar parenting of Andria Mayberry, the mother of rapper and actor Bryshere Gray cannot be denied.

Let’s first address the elephant in the room, Jussie Smollett and his ongoing drama with Chicago PD. From the moment that this began, the revelation of the actor’s attack possibly being set-up on the actor’s part, Andria has been firm in the fact that she has nothing but love for Jussie. “When I talked to Jussie, I told him that I loved him.” No judgment, just love. That is the epitome of Ms. Mayberry, a mother in every sense of the word. Her instinct is to love, nurture and be a part of a solution, not the problem. When it would be understandable for her to be negative and resentful of a person bringing pessimism to a project that her son works hard to help make successful, she takes the high road and asserts her maternal powers of love and understanding. “I wasn’t there. I don’t know what happened but what I do know is that this young man needs love.”

Andria does not just speak these words, she lives them. As Byshere Gray’s mother, she has made the decision to take all that she has done, all that she has learned and help other mothers to be the best that they can for their kids, especially those in the entertainment industry and those with disabilities. Andria founded Ms. Berry Cares, to empower and encourage parents, Momagers of any industry, especially entertainment, to navigate through the trickery, while advocating and looking out for their kids’ best interest. “My calling is to educate, empower, and encourage the parents to stay involved in the dreams of their children,” Ms. Mayburry states.

Andria also teaches parents to fight for their children with disabilities. There is so much that goes into this process, nobody should be subjected to having to figure it out on their own. There is the initial diagnosis and coming to terms with the fact that your child may not be “normal”. Post-diagnosis involves prescription medications, school IEPs, avoiding triggers and navigating daily life with a new diagnosis. Andria goes into more details in her book Before Empire. She shared different anger management situations that came up with Byshere, throwing things and being highly volatile along with stepping in and stopping her son from taking Ritalin, and ordering his heart to be tested regularly because he was an athlete on medication. She not only pours into parents with her knowledge and roadmap to navigating the process, but she also shares intimate moments about how she helped her son cope with his ADHD. “I feel it is important for parents to educate themselves on their child’s disorder. This will allow them to be better advocates for their children.” She spoke with me in depth about the importance of not only understanding the circumstances of a child’s disorder but the biological effects of the medications prescribed. Understanding the side effects of medication can be the difference in your child living a fulfilled life or a limited existence.

Andria Mayberry has been in the nursing field for almost 2 decades and has no plans to abandon the profession that has allowed her to provide for her 2 kids all of these years. She had her daughter Brea after high school and Bryshere 2 years later. Her abusive relationship would lead her to be a single mother but never without help or solid finances. She continued to work, sometimes multiple jobs, to provide for her kids. With her father’s help, Andria provided for her children and supported their dreams and desires.

Even when times got tough, Ms. Mayburry said, “Always put God first. I didn’t pray for food or water. I prayed for wisdom because wisdom will help me get what I need.”

Having a baby brother with a disability can understandably leave a young girl with a bit of resentment. Byshere’s sister, Brea, started to exhibit negative feelings based on the attention that her brother was getting. This caused distention in the relationship with her and her mother. This dynamic has since reversed course. A new understanding has blossomed because Brea’s son has been diagnosed with ADHD. She is now experiencing the same obstacles that her mother went through but with the awesome blessing of having her mother’s knowledge, experience, and support.

Andrias Moms Who Rock

Past the struggles, the abuse, the obstacles, and the necessary sacrifices, Andria has rolled all of her experience, passion, and love into a new project that she launched last year, Moms Who ROC (Raising our Children). This event is a big thank you to moms with awards, recognition, self-care, therapy, conversations, and an all-male panel that travels to different states. It is empowering. It is celebratory. It is everything that hardworking moms don’t get enough of. Moms Who Roc may be coming to a city near you.

“As a mother, educate children. Be aware. Don’t let others change your character. Make sure that you get out and vote,“ wise words from a wise woman.

In the wake of actor Jussie Smollett's arrest for the alleged perpetration of a fake hate crime, political and media figures—many of whom were quick to support Smollett's story—have sought to emphasize that commentators should not downplay the real rise of hate crimes in America.

""We must speak the truth: hate crimes are on the rise in America,"" 2020 contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) wrote in a statement released on Twitter. ""Just last year, the FBI released statistics that revealed a 17 percent increase in the number of hate crimes in America.""

""We don't know what happened to Jussie, but what we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country, homophobia is alive and well in this country. 2017 set a record for the number of hate crimes,"" claimed Vox‘s Liz Plank in a CNN appearance. ""There has been an increase in hate crimes against the LGBT community, against Muslims, against black people.""

But not everyone is so sure. Plank's co-panelist, Reason contributor Kmele Foster, pushed back on her claim, arguing that ""even in FBI statistics, there's a great deal of ambiguity about what makes something a hate crime.""

""There is not a lot of statistical evidence to support the notion that hate crimes are surging,"" added Foster's Reason colleague Robby Soave.

In absolute terms, even one hate crime is tragic and condemnable. But in relative terms, knowing how frequently hate crimes are committed, especially in the context of history, can help to create a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about how society and policymakers should respond. So how common are hate crimes, anyway?

Harris's claim that hate crimes have increased ""17 percent"", which has previously been repeated by news outlets, comes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), specifically its Hate Crime Statistics series. The UCR aggregates data from police departments from across the nation, and is routinely used as the source for annual crime statistics.

(A separate source of data on criminal offenses is the National Crime Victimization Survey, administered by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which asks a statistically representative sample of Americans about their experiences of being criminally victimized. The most recent report on the topic from the NCVS indicated that hate crime rates fell between 2004 and 2015; however, summarized data were not available for years after 2015, limiting its usefulness for analyzing recent trends.)

The 17 percent figure cited by Harris and others is just the percent change in the number of hate crime incidents reported to the UCR in 2017 over 2016—7,175 in 2017 and 6,121 in 2016. But this figure is misleading for two reasons. First, such absolute numbers need to be population adjusted, to account for the year-on-year increase in the U.S. population.

Second, not all law enforcement agencies actually report hate crimes to the FBI—in 2017 for example, about 16,000 sent in figures, covering about 94 percent of the population. To accurately assess the frequency of hate crimes, then, we need to convert the absolute number of incidents into a rate, by dividing that figure by the covered population.

For 2017, the number of hate crime incidents per 100,000 people covered by reporting agencies was 2.34, up from 2.11 in 2016. That's a 10.9 percent increase—still notable, but less than the figure used by Harris and others.

The plot above highlights a couple of important points. First, in available historical context, the hate crime rate is substantially lower than it used to be. (The spike in 2001 is attributable to an increase in anti-Islam and anti-Muslim hate crimes following 9/11.) Plank's claim that ""2017 set a record for the number of hate crimes"" is just false, both in absolute and population-adjusted terms.

The second important point, however, is that the hate crime rate rose notably between 2014 and 2017, up 27 percent from the historic low. Many left-leaning commentators have pointed to this as evidence that President Donald Trump, who emerged as a political force in 2015, has caused an increase in prejudiced thoughts and actions.

Disentangling a ""Trump effect"" is a question more complicated than space here permits. But this overall trend—a historic low in 2014, followed by a rise—actually parallels another: the tendency in the crime rate.

The overall crime rate, and especially the violent crime rate, rose in 2015 and 2016, before tapering off in 2017. It's not clear why, with commentators blaming everything from increased scrutiny on cops to increased availability of handguns. But it would make sense to think about hate crimes and crime overall as rising and falling together, especially if the crime rate is determined by the rise and fall of the permissibility of antisocial behavior more generally.

That gives us another way to look at hate crimes, namely by asking what percentage of population-adjusted crimes are accounted for by population-adjusted hate crimes.

Simply dividing one by the other shows that as of 2017, hate crimes had more or less returned to the historic average for hate crimes as a proportion of all crimes (an average likely slightly distorted by the outlier year of 2001). In other words: hate crimes have recently been a disproportionately low percentage of overall crimes, and are returning to recent history levels.

To summarize all this: the rate of hate crimes has risen from its historic low in 2014, but still remains well-below historic norms—just like the overall crime rate. Claims of historic highs are dramatically overstated, but America has certainly done better on the issue in the recent past than it did as of 2017.

Additionally, there are two specific reasons for concern. First, the overall crime rate dropped in 2017, while the hate crime rate continued to climb. If this trend persists into 2018, it might indicate that the causes of hate crime and of crime overall are not one-and-the-same, meaning more serious analysis is required to disentangle the etiology of the hate crime rise.

Second, specific subgroups are facing elevated levels of hate crimes. There were roughly 300 more anti-black and anti-Jewish hate crime incidents in 2017 over 2016; the two groups are routinely the most targeted victims of racist and anti-religious hate crimes, respectively.

Especially if the number of hate crimes did rise in 2018 separate from the crime rate, policy makers may need to look more seriously at what has driven that increase. That includes asking what has caused increased targeting of black and Jewish Americans. Final figures on 2018 are unlikely to be available until the end of the year."

Smollett turned himself into authorities on Thursday after being slapped with a felony charge of filing a false police report. After spending a few hours in custody, he posted $100,000 bond. In a press conference, Chicago police superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said the “Empire” star orchestrated a hate crime against himself because he was unhappy about his salary on the show.

The actor, however, has maintained his innocence, with his team releasing a statement saying Smollett “feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

On Friday, the show announced that they would remove Smollett’s character from the remaining two episodes of Season 5.

Smollett denies the allegations.

On Friday night Maher argued that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who scrapped a plan to build a second Amazon headquarters in New York City earlier this month, should create that facility in an economically impoverished Middle American city that (in Maher's mind) really needs it.

""Bezos, you’re worth $130 billion. Take one for the team! Stop playing cities off against one another and help a dying one come back to life,"" Maher scolded the corporate executive. He also compared him unfavorably to infamous mobster Bugsy Siegel, who Maher argued transformed Las Vegas into the bustling metropolis that it is today despite that city having few prospects prior to the middle of the 20th century.

While this argument may not have been controversial on its own terms – few would necessarily disagree with Maher that ""we have a problem in America called spatial geographic inequality, which means that the most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities"" — Maher also made a number of jokes about the red states that have become controversial.

""Maybe that has something to do with why Trump voters are obsessed with ‘owning the libs,’ because the libs own everything else,"" Maher joked at one point, adding that ""the blue parts of America are having a big prosperity party, while that big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail — and they still use the mail.""

On another occasion he joked, ""That’s why red state voters are so pissed off. They don’t hate us, they want to be us. They want to go the party. It’s like we’re the British royal family and they’re Meghan Markle’s dad.""

He also quipped that there are ""no red carpets in Wyoming,"" that they only wear Target, that ""we have chef Wolfgang Puck, they have Chef Boyardee"" and that ""our roofs have solar panels, theirs have last year’s Christmas lights."" Liberals and conservatives alike congregated on Twitter to denounce his condescending attitude toward Middle America.

Maher also discussed the revelation that Jussie Smollett, the former co-star on the hit Fox show ""Empire,"" is alleged to have faked a racist and homophobic hate crime against himself. After arguing that this was because ""there’s nothing more powerful than being a victim"" in modern America, the comedian argued that ""I feel like we’ve gone from this place where I hear people say, ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed. Take you seriously – that’s a big difference, but we seem to have skipped that step because we always do."""

But it has had few days as busy as the past four.

On Thursday, Jussie Smollett, the actor from “Empire” who has been accused by police of staging a fake hate crime in which he was the victim, stood in Courtroom 102 as his bond was set at a hundred thousand dollars. (Smollett has denied the allegation.) And on Saturday, the singer R. Kelly was led into the same courtroom to appear before the same judge, John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr., who set bond at a million dollars on ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse being brought against the R. & B. superstar.

Sandwiched between the two courtrooms where bond hearings are held, behind an unmarked door, is the press room, where the reporters who regularly cover more mundane happenings file their stories and grouse about how the aging building is stifling in the summer and freezing in the winter. If the hundred or so extra journalists who attended this week’s big bond hearings had taken a moment to duck their heads in, they would have seen, amid the many stacks of manila folders with court orders from high-profile cases, a folder marked “R. Kelly.” Megan Crepeau, of the Chicago Tribune, tweeted a picture of it. The file does not yet hold paperwork from Kelly’s current case; its freshest document dates to 2008, when Kelly was tried, upstairs in Courtroom 500, on charges of making child pornography.

Kelly was famously acquitted in his first trial, but he now stands accused by the State of Illinois again, for incidents said to have taken place between 1998 and 2010, when three of his four alleged victims, identified by the state only by their initials, were minors. One of them, Jerhonda Pace, sat in the courtroom crying as she heard Jennifer Gonzalez, the assistant state’s attorney, describe case 19CR-2760. The state, in its bond proffer, offered additional details about what allegedly happened to her: Pace attended Kelly’s trial in Chicago, in 2008, met the star, got his autograph, and, a few months later, “had vaginal and oral sex with Robert Kelly multiple times.” She was sixteen. “At times, Robert Kelly would spit on her, slap her in the face, and choke her. The victim saved one of the shirts she was wearing when Robert Kelly ejaculated.” The state submitted the T-shirt for DNA testing, which indicated that the semen was Kelly’s, Gonzalez told the court.

Pace first went public when she talked to me for a story in August, 2017, breaking a nondisclosure agreement with Kelly that she had signed in exchange for a cash settlement. I learned about the indictments in the new case against Kelly on Friday, several hours before the charges against him were announced, when Pace called me. “They’ve got him!” she said. “They’ve finally got him!”

Azriel Clary, who, her parents allege, is one of a group of women being held against their will by the singer, attended Kelly’s bond hearing, but she did not speak to her parents, or even turn around to look at them, as they sat several rows behind her in Courtroom 102. She stared straight ahead at Kelly, who appeared at the front of the room wearing a black sweatshirt, his face expressionless. On her way in and out of court, Clary held hands with Joycelyn Savage, a woman whose parents say also began a sexual relationship with Kelly, in 2015, when she was nineteen years old. Both women are still living with Kelly in what their parents call his “cult.”

After the bond hearing, in the large hallway at the main entrance to the courts building, Kim Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney; the lawyer Michael Avenatti; and Kelly’s defense attorney, Steve Greenberg, held their second press conferences in twenty-four hours. Foxx did not take questions at either. Avenatti, who claims to represent “multiple clients” connected to the case, said that Kelly would never walk free again.

A new, forty-five-minute videotape is the most complicated part of the state’s current case. The bond proffer states: “In 2001, a witness had conversations with Robert Kelly and Robert Kelly’s associates where the witness was asked to retrieve videotapes showing Robert Kelly having sexual intercourse with the victim in this case”—identified by the state as R.L.—“when she was fourteen years old. The witness obtained that video and watched it. The witness eventually turned this video over to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office through his attorney”—Avenatti. “S.E. has identified the girl in the video as her niece, the victim in this case.”

When Gonzalez read those words in court, and Foxx later repeated them, reporters familiar with the 2008 trial instantly recognized S.E. as Stephanie Edwards, who recorded a gold-selling, self-titled album with Kelly, in 1998, under her stage name, Sparkle. She testified at Kelly’s first trial. She was one of fifteen witnesses who identified R.L. and testified about her underage sexual relationship with Kelly, yet jurors voted not to convict Kelly. Afterward, they pointed to the fact that R.L. herself never testified.

During his press conferences, Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, branded all of the women making charges against his client, as well as those who appeared in a recent Lifetime documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” as liars. He also denied any wrongdoing by his client. Things have changed since Kelly was first indicted, in 2002: the media interest generated by “Surviving R. Kelly,” coupled with the pressure of the activist movements #MuteRKelly, #MeToo, and Time’s Up, are all clearly a big part of what has led to the new charges against the singer. (Federal authorities are also weighing bringing charges against him.)

Kelly’s personal situation has changed, too. In court on Saturday, Greenberg told Judge Lyke that Kelly would have trouble raising the necessary ten per cent of his million-dollar bond to post bail. “He doesn’t have a hundred thousand dollars sitting in the bank, in a shoebox, anywhere,” Greenberg said. In a meandering, nineteen-minute track released last July, Kelly sang, “I’m a broke-ass legend.” He has long claimed to have been ripped off by managers and former associates, although he does not mention the settlements that he has paid to women who’ve accused him of sexual improprieties—six have been publicly reported—or the legal fees he’s incurred from defending himself against other charges.

The contrast between Kelly’s first appearance in bond court, in 2002, and the one on Saturday was striking to the few reporters, like me, who were present at both. Seventeen years ago, Kelly promptly paid his bond with seven hundred and fifty hundred-dollar bills, and left Twenty-sixth and Cal to sing for a group of kindergartners at Salem Baptist Church, on Chicago’s South Side. On Saturday, Judge Lyke ordered Kelly to turn over his passport and avoid contact with anyone under the age of eighteen. As of this writing, Kelly has not posted bond, and he sits in Cook County Jail, next door to the courthouse."

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate.

The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives :

that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative.

It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse because - in fired FBI Director James Comey’s formulation - a “higher duty” than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Or - in fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s words - “the threat” was too great. Nevermind that the nature of “the threat” was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offenders—and Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureau’s ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as “an insurance policy” against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming president’s reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students’ treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the “high crimes and misdemeanors” required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the president’s enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his “higher duty,” lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabe’s proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsel’s inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the election’s result."

Smollett, who is black and gay, is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He’s accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack on himself last month in downtown Chicago.

Police say Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Smollett denies the allegations.

The Empire actor stands accused of filing a fake police report related to the January incident, in which he claimed a pair of masked men attacked him late at night on a Chicago street while shouting racist and homophobic slurs. The story later came under scrutiny, and police ultimately claimed that Smollett had faked the attack against himself and lied to police about it.

But the Empire actor now has evidence to counter the charges against him, the New York Post reported. Though police said that Smollett paid the Nigerian brothers $3,500 to launch the attack against him, Smollett reportedly claims that the check was actually written for a “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go).” As TMZ reported on Sunday, that was written in the memo line of the check that was dated January 23, just a few days before the attack.

The report added that Smollett wanted to lose 10 pounds for the music video for his song, “Don’t Go,” and planned to work with the brothers, who work out in the gym at his luxury apartment building in Chicago. Smollett reportedly has other evidence to back up that he was working on a nutrition program, including text messages about food plans.

It was not clear if Smollett had other evidence to point to his innocence, as police reportedly had other evidence — aside from the personal check — to connect Smollett to the attack, including phone records. Police have also raided the apartment of the two brothers initially identified as suspects in the attack, and are seeking evidence to see if Smollett was involved in the fabrication of a threatening letter sent to him before the attack.

Smollett has not come forward with evidence that reportedly counters the police account of his attack, but lawyers for the actor said they plan to mount an aggressive defense.

Jussie Smollett has maintained his innocence, even reportedly going to the set of Empire to tell fellow cast members that he did not orchestrate the attack. But the actor could still face more trouble, with federal investigators (reportedly) continuing to investigate whether the actor also faked a threatening letter that was sent to him in the days before the attack. Mail fraud is a federal offense and could lead to a prison term of five years or more."

Jussie Smollett “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during an impassioned press conference, in which he discussed what’s now popularly known as the “Jussie Smollett Hoax.”

“To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks,” Johnson said. “Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor.”

What was initially reported as a hate crime against a gay, black man by supporters of President Donald Trump was actually—in Johnson’s view—a “shameful” attempt by Smollett to stage a “publicity stunt.” The president, writing on Twitter, referred to Smollett’s comments as “dangerous.”

What’s the significance of Johnson’s comments on the Smollett case? What is the danger that Trump warned about on Twitter? Why did the media and presidential candidates weigh in so quickly before the facts were known? And what impact does all of this have on the 2020 elections?

Epoch Times senior editor Jan Jekielek interviewed Steven Rogers, a Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member who headed the criminal investigations division of a New Jersey police department for almost two decades. He also is a former senior U.S. Navy intelligence officer and FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member.

Jan Jekielek: We’re going to talk about this Jussie Smollett situation, what many people are calling a hoax. The Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, did a long press conference explaining what the department had found. And I’m wondering if you could kind of outline that for us? The thing that struck me about it was that it was a very definitive and passionate statement. And with your experience working in police, you might be able to offer a perspective. It was something different than I’m used to seeing.

Steven Rogers: Keep in mind that it was not only a hoax—it was a very dangerous criminal act that this individual created in that city and possibly around the country. Now, with regard to the police superintendent, he did an outstanding job, obviously, in investigating the case, but more so quickly, getting the correct and truthful information out to the public. That transparency on his part probably prevented more violence, not only in his city, but in some areas around the country. Keep in mind that the individual who committed this act named a specific group of people, and that would be the supporters of President Donald Trump, who in his view, according to his actions, regarding the reason why the crime was perpetrated upon him, was because of the so-called rhetoric of the president and the MAGA supporters, which we know is completely not truthful.

Mr. Jekielek: So, there were over 50 subpoenas, more than 100 people interviewed, there were over 50 cameras actually searched to get evidence. It feels like an astounding amount of police work, over a very few days.

Mr. Rogers: Well, that’s another reason why you give much credit to the Chicago Police Department and the superintendent. This was a very high-profile case, a very sensitive case. And it goes back to what I just said: If the police would have treated this, perhaps, less than what they did, there was a potential for more violence to be surfacing around the country. So, yes, manpower-intensive. I could imagine the tens of thousands of dollars it cost that city to investigate, but they wanted an airtight case. As the superintendent said, it wasn’t the technology that the department had to close this case, it was the leg work, the footwork, the handwork, and the investigative work of those police detectives.

Mr. Jekielek: Superintendent Johnson said that he was offended and angry, in the opening words of that press conference. Can you tell me more about, based on your experience, why he might have done that?

Mr. Rogers: I’ve got to tell you, it’s rare, isn’t it? It’s rare to see the leader of a police department come out and use those words, but the man loves his city. He loves his department. He’s very passionate about preventing crime in that city. He talked about the resources that were taken away from real victims of crime, and that’s victims of the violence in that city. So, if there was ever a role model for police chiefs around this country and around the world, it’s this man, because he was speaking not as a police superintendent, but I think more importantly as a father, and as a citizen of that community. He was speaking from his soul and his heart, and it certainly resonated with the American people.

Mr. Jekielek: He also said, and this really kind of struck me, that bogus claims—which it really appears that this almost certainly is one—cause harm. Can you expand on that?

Mr. Rogers: Well, sure. But let me give a few examples. In my experience in law enforcement, there have been many people who would come to me and our police officers and tell us that they were victims of crime. We would put a lot of resources into these investigations, and we’d find that they lied to us. So, why are they harmful? They’re harmful because when the real person, the real victim, comes to the police, you’re almost thinking, “Is this something that is going to be repeated over and over again?” especially if these individuals get away with these crimes. This is why it’s important. The second stage of this is the courts. The courts are going to have to lay heavy, heavy penalties on this individual, including jail time, so that other people aren’t encouraged to commit these acts.

Mr. Jekielek: Let me jump to a tweet that the president made; as all this is being uncovered, he said: “@Jussie Smollett What about MAGA (‘Make America Great Again’) and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments.” Why do you think the president did that?

Mr. Rogers: I’ll tell you: The president has worked very, very hard to create a great relationship with the minority community across this country. And I could attest to the fact that it is working, that he’s got a lot of pastors around this country, from the inner cities, working with him. He’s performed very well with regard to employment in the minority community, so the president is building bridges, and he is addressing the problems of racism in the country. So here, this Smollett comes along, and in one criminal act—one terrible criminal act—he tries to dismantle everything that the president of the United States has been doing. That’s No. 1.

No. 2 [is that] I work with organizations that work with MAGA supporters, I’ve been to rallies there where there have been 20, 30, 40 thousand MAGA supporters. And I can tell you that there has been no racial incidents. You’ve got one or two people who will get a little overexcited. Have you seen riots? Have you seen civil disturbances? Absolutely not. And many of those MAGA supporters are who? People from minority communities. So, that’s why the president tweeted that out. He believes that Smollett should apologize, as we all do, to the MAGA supporters of the president of the United States, and he should also apologize to the minority communities across this country for committing the act that he committed.

Mr. Jekielek: Let’s switch gears a little bit here. When this was first reported by Jussie Smollett, and then a number of media picked it up, there were interviews, and … we will jump to the media in a moment. But a number of, even presidential candidates, basically, spoke out, I think on Twitter initially, notably Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, kind of condemning what had happened, assuming that this was factual. They seem to have jumped the gun. Perhaps it’s not the first time that we’re seeing people jump the gun. Can you comment on that?

Mr. Rogers: There’s a reason for that. Because the motives of those critics or the motives of those who supported Smollett, their motive was—it had nothing to do with him, nothing to do with the crime that was committed. It had everything to do with seizing an opportunity to do what? To criticize President Donald Trump, to again go after the president, to blame the president, to blame his supporters. So their motives are not pure. The politicians that came out and jumped the gun without any facts, without any police reports that were articulated by the police superintendent, they seized the opportunity to do what? To go after President Trump. So, if Jussie Smollett thinks he has friends in these people—it has nothing to do with him in their eyes. It has everything to do with their political agenda. There’s your reason why they did that.

Mr. Jekielek: Superintendent Johnson, also in his address in the press conference, chided the media for basically jumping the gun and reporting things that weren’t necessarily factual, as being factual. This actually was the same thing that we saw with the Covington kids story a few weeks earlier—at least that’s what I believe we’re seeing. What do you think that says about the media coverage of the president?

Mr. Rogers: Well, I’ve said, and I could attest to this fact, that with the exception of your network here, and some others—very few others—the media in this country is no longer reporting news. What they are doing is jumping on the political propaganda bandwagon in order to do damage to this president. The fact of the matter is that you are hard-pressed to find good news—and I’m not talking about good news, I’m talking about fair news, and the media jumps on these particular incidents, to do what? They care nothing about the victims, they care nothing about the facts, but they care everything about trying to bring the president down.

This is a very difficult message for a person like me to get across, because people find it hard to believe that the media in this country would do that. I could tell you this, and I’ve said this all over the country: Walter Cronkite, from years ago, would be rolling over in his grave if he saw what these media outlets are doing. But as I said earlier to a group of people here: He would rise from the grave if he came here and saw what your media outlet is doing, and others are doing, with regard to true journalism. That to me is very, very important, because we don’t have much of that here in this country today.

Mr. Jekielek: How is it that the superintendent—basically the way he talked about things to me—sounded like: “This guy is just guilty, I’ve decided this guy’s guilty.” There was no presumption of innocence in there, right? I don’t usually see people speak that way. So he feels he has an airtight case?

Mr. Rogers: He saw the evidence, and the biggest piece of evidence was the check. [Smollett] signed a check and paid off the two individuals he had commit the crime against him. You don’t do that, you [use] cash. So there were enough dots connected for this police superintendent to articulate the fact that this guy is guilty. There’s no question about it.

Now, his defense may not be a not-guilty defense. It may be “Can we reduce or have no jail time?” Because any defense attorney is going to realize there is enough evidence against this guy to put him away. My guess is they’re going to be fighting to make sure there’s no jail time.

Mr. Jekielek: This is something that struck me, again in light of what you were speaking about, with respect to media and so forth. Do you think that Smollett somehow felt like he might get a pass on doing this? How is it that someone even conceives of doing such a thing, I guess, is my question?

Mr. Rogers: Well, they conceive of doing such a thing because they believe they could get away with it. If they didn’t think they could get away with it, they wouldn’t be doing these things. Here’s an individual who probably felt that, because of the way the mainstream media have been projecting a lot of these incidents, kind of favoring this side of so-called victims of these bogus crimes, he probably thought he would be falling into that category. Don’t forget, he’s on a TV series, a popular guy, supposed to be a good actor, and he probably thought that this would boost his value, but instead, it certainly backfired.

Mr. Jekielek: What if he was successful? What impact do you think that would have had on Trump supporters, the campaign, and so forth?

Mr. Rogers: I don’t think very much because, as I’ve always said, people are responsible for their own actions. I hear time and again where there are incidents regarding people with MAGA hats on, or people at Trump events, and, right away, the media wants to blame President Trump because of some individual who decided to get out of hand. Well, you know what? The president has nothing to do with that. When I go out and speak, if somebody gets out of hand, and they had a few drinks, am I responsible for their actions? So, it wouldn’t have had much impact on that. People need to be accountable for their own actions and not continuously blame the next guy. You know the old saying, “The devil made me do it”? Well, you know what? That doesn’t fly anymore. Be accountable, be responsible for your own actions. That’s the way that would have played out if it did happen the way this individual said it happened.

Mr. Jekielek: Let me frame this question a different way as well. If we—if the general public, including perhaps myself—believed [the story] and this hoax-related evidence hadn’t come to light, how do you think that would have affected the vote in 2020?

Mr. Rogers: I guess the question is, what if it was real, what if it happened, what if it was all over the belief of the MAGA supporters of the president? I can tell you myself and others and probably the president would say, we don’t do things like that. We don’t start or commit acts of violence. We do things the right way. Do you know what the right way is? Get in the voting booth, get involved. And the president and his campaign has always said that we don’t want people to get involved in any violent confrontations. Exercise your rights of free speech, exercise the freedoms you have, but the last thing on earth that I know the president or any of his supporters want to get involved in is any act of violent confrontation with anyone. So, it wouldn’t have had much impact, other than we would have corrected some people’s courses.

Mr. Jekielek: What if something like this happened five days before the election?

Mr. Rogers: Again, I don’t think it would change much, because the president has solid support in this country, and people are smart today. Keep in mind with the internet and all of the news feeds we have, at least we do have a lot of good stuff over the internet and we do have stations that are bringing the truth in. I don’t think it would have much impact because the president’s accomplishments—which unfortunately are not talked about very much— far outweigh and outpace some of the negative things that have been portrayed about him around the country. Don’t forget our quality of life is really good in this country now. The economy is strong, the military is strong, and what he’s doing with regard to foreign policy is just outstanding. The man has kept every promise he’s made to the American people. They’ve given him a hard time. The democratic socialists have given him a hard time, especially with regard to the wall, but he’s keeping his promises. So, the impact of anything like this would have been minimal five days before the election.

Mr. Jekielek: Is there anything else you think that’s important to reference with respect to this Jussie Smollett situation?

Mr. Rogers: I do. What I think is important to reference is No. 1, be cautious before you pass judgment on any case. Let the police do their job. Make sure you get all the information before you pass any judgment. And No. 2, what is very important is that this individual goes to jail, and that he’s ordered to repay the city of Chicago and that police department every single dime that they expended on the investigation. That may discourage someone else from committing a similar act.

On Tuesday, January 29, the ""Empire"" actor claimed that he was attacked by white men who directed anti-gay and racist comments at him. While addressing the public three weeks after, the Chicago police discredited him and believed he made up the story.

While giving a statement to reveal the outcome of an investigation, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accused Smollett of betraying the trust of the city.

""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?

""How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?""

Terrence Howard shows support

While the city is processing over the perceived betrayal, Jussie Smollett has received encouragement from Terrence Howard, a co-actor on the ""Empire"" television show.

Howard plays his dad Lucious Lyon on the Fox series. His post on Instagram today captured the type of affection expected from one occupying that role.

""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,"" he wrote in a caption. A video of Jussie Smollett holding a baby revealed an actor who is charming with little kids.

Smollett is expected to appear in court on Thursday, March 14, 2019, after getting charged with disorderly conduct-false report."

Daniels posted a video on Instagram on January 10 condemning homophobia after his cousin was targeted and beaten because of his sexuality.

'This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories,' the Empire creator wrote alongside the video.

'It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better. We need to continue to remember to love and to turn against the hate that we’re seeing out there. But we all need to fight that fight together.

Sources told TMZ that Daniels' incident may have inspired actor Jussie Smollett to allegedly fake his own hate-crime attack

'For all the people who are hurting, who are struggling, and who are trying to find some meaning in this life, I am here to say if you need a safe place or a ear to listen, then I'm here.'

In addition to posting about the incident on social media, Daniels also spoke about it on the Empire set, sources told TMZ.

The sources, who are reportedly close to the show's production staff, believe Smollett may have gotten the idea to allegedly stage his own attack after hearing Daniels' story.

Smollett was charged on Thursday for allegedly faking the January 29 incident in which he claims he was beaten by two strangers in a racist and homophobic attack.

He told police the men called him a 'fa***t' and the N-word before shouting 'This is MAGA country', dousing him in bleach and throwing a rope around his neck.

Police have said Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack.

Smollett insists he is telling the truth about his attack.

Daniels issued a statement with Empire executive producers on Friday saying that Smollett's character would be cut from the final two episodes of it fifth season after he was charged.

They said the case had taken a toll on the entire cast and crew.

The statement did not reveal whether or not they believe Smollett's innocence, but said the allegations against him are 'disturbing'.

'The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us.

'Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

'We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.'

Daniels was among those to speak out after the incident was first reported to condemn it and offer his unreserved support to the actor.

'It’s taken me a minute to come to social media about this because, Jussie, you are my son,' he said in an Instagram video.

'You didn’t deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck, to have bleach thrown on you, to be called ‘die f****t n****r’ or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are because it shows we are united on a united front and no racist f*** can come in and do the things that they did to you.

In January, a developer offered to shell out $400 million for the six lots. The sellers countered at $600 million, but the bidder didn't bite.

At Beverly Hills' highest point, a 157-acre land parcel with a storied history is hit the market last summer with the highest price tag L.A. has ever seen at $1 billion - it is now $650 million

The listing agent, calls it 'the crown jewel of Beverly Hills' with the closest neighbour half-a-mile away

It is considered a 'crown jewel' with views of downtown LA and the Pacific Ocean

The massive land comes with its own history of wealthy owners from royals, to Hollywood celebrities and moguls who all had plans, albeit unsuccessful, to develop the property.

'For that billionaire who wants that privacy on the highest peak of Beverly Hills, it's a great opportunity,' Kirman said.

So far, no one has come close to buying personal properly with that price tag.

The highest price ever paid for a home in the world is thought to be the $300million purchase of a property in France by a Saudi prince.

The grounds are divided into 17 parcels. Six of them, ranging from 2.5 acres to 12.2 acres, are zoned for residential development

The current owner is Secured Capital Property. Victor Franco Noval, son of philanthropist Victorino Noval, is listed as the manager of the LLC that owns Secured Capital Property

At 157 acres the plan alone is more than twice the size of Disneyland

The $650million-dollar listing is the most expensive in the history of Los Angeles

'There are 2,200 billionaires in the world,' Kirman said with the hopes at least one will be willing to invest and build. 'We realized there are 100 of those that could and would want to buy the property.'

The property is nearly double the size of Disneyland and touts the best views in all of Los Angeles with a 360-degree lookout revealing everything from Downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean.

The mountaintop was once owned by Princess Shams Pahlavi, a sister of the late Shah of Iran, who in the late 1970s had planned to construct a palace there that was never built.

It was later bought by talk show host and game show pro host Merv Griffin in 1987, who planned to create his own mansion.

An impressive set of gates guard the property keeping unwanted visitors away

It is unusual for such a high price tag to be placed on a property where nothing has been built

'We'll have a helipad, a couple of lakes and a palladio-style house, like those you see outside Venice, Italy but with a variation, because we'll need lots of glass for the views,' Griffin told The Los Angeles Times when he made the purchase.

But when financial troubles hit, Griffin sold the property to Mark Hughes, the founder of Herbalife, for more than $8 million in 1997.

At the time, the deal was a record high in Southern California.

Real estate agent Jeff Hyland, who handled the sale, said the property is 'one of a kind.'

'There will never be anything else like it,' he said of the massive estate.

The driveway looks to be the only thing so far that has been completed - and the rest will be up to whoever buys the plot

The land looks out to 360-degree views that show everything from Downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean

It takes a lot of sprinklers to keep the grass in this area so perfectly green

Hughes bought the property with plans to develop it, but died in 2000 before he could break ground.

Now the grounds with its famous 90210 Beverly Hills zip code is owned by Secured Capital Property.

The land is divided into 17 parcels with several of them zoned for residential development.

However, Kirman is adamant that one buyer will develop the land for individual use.

'To be impressed by dirt is hard,' Kirman admitted, but says he is looking at royal family from the Middle East, a Chinese billionaire or Russian oligarch as potential buyers."

Authorities claim he faked the assault because he was dissatisfied with his salary. Sky News host Rita Panahi said the actor's claims about the incident and details surrounding it didn't add up, which 'is why so many conservative and libertarian commentators felt comfortable questioning it'. Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon in the US TV drama Empire, claimed he was targeted by two masked men, apparently Trump supporters, as he walked home from a sandwich shop.

Jussie Smollett has evidence that disputes allegations he paid two brothers $3500 ($A4900) to help stage his hate attack, according to a new report.

A cheque showing that amount and made payable from the Empire star’s account to one of the men, Abimbola Osundairo, also has “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go)” written in the memo line, TMZ reported on Sunday.

According to the New York Post, police and prosecutors said the checque, dated January 23, is evidence that the 36-year-old paid Osundairo and his brother Olabinjo to carry out the hoax assault in Chicago six days later.

But sources told TMZ that the payment was really for training to help Smollett get into shape for a music video for his song, “Don’t Go.”

The singer-songwriter wanted to lose weight for the video — because he was supposed to appear shirtless in it — so he hired Abimbola, a jacked bodybuilder whom he knew from the gym and called “Bon.”

Other evidence weighing in Smollett’s favour are a series of texts between him and “Bon” beginning on January 20, which outlined a healthy meal plan including chicken thigh, Starkist tuna, eggs and peanut butter and various fruit.

“This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss,” Abimbola texted Smollett.

Another one, dated Jan. 28 — hours before the attack, the gym buff wrote to Smollett, “I know you’re travelling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

The $US3500 ($A4900) total cheque accounted for $US600-a-week ($A841) for five weeks of the workout plan and $US100-a-week ($A140) for the food plan, also for five weeks, sources told TMZ.

Another text seems to show that “Don’t Go” was slated to film on February 23. Meanwhile, a screenshot from Venmo shows Smollett had paid “Bola” $US100 ($A140) on September 27 for “training” — potentially giving credence to the actor’s claims that the $US3500 ($A4900) wasn’t related to the January 29 “attack.”

Both brothers testified before a grand jury that the payment was for training.

Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He is free after posting 10 per cent of $US100,000 ($A140,000) bond.

It comes Smollett’s Empire co-star Terrence Howard backed his friend, telling fans “the Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious.”

Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on Empire, voiced his support for his on-screen son in an Instagram post on the weekend.

“All your lil homies got you … We love the hell outta you,” Howard captioned a video showing the 36-year-old actor playing with Howard’s young son, Hero.

Howard also fiercely defended Smollett against fans who were critical of his support.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he wrote in a reply to one fan. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

After being removed from the final two episodes of “Empire’s” current season, Jussie Smollett’s character may be recast altogether. The news comes amid the deepening scandal surrounding the actor, who was arrested this week for filing a false report after claiming he was assaulted in a hate crime late last month. The news comes from TVLine, which further reports that “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels (on whom Smollett’s character of Jamal is loosely based) is “said to be a strong proponent of the recast option.”

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us” said series executives Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer in a statement released after Smollett was arrested.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

“Empire” is nearing the end of its fifth season, and Smollett has co-starred since it began four years ago. According to Chicago PD, he “staged” his attack in order to receive a higher salary on the Fox drama and “promote his career.”

Kamala Harris (D) is the aunt of embattled actor Jussie Smollett.

In a tweet that he has since deleted, Salem Media radio host Kevin McCullough made mention of Harris’s previous support form Smollett before his story about being attacked by Trump fans fell apart, before pushing a theory that she was hiding her family ties to the actor.

“So there is this….” McCullough tweeted, “Turns out @KamalaHarris is @JussieSmollett’s aunt. As in his mother’s sister. Which in several of her photo-op updates on the story to date she has yet to reveal.”

While Smollett’s mother’s maiden name is indeed Harris, she is not Kamala’s sister Maya.

As Jim Swift at The Bulwark wrote, “It is unclear how McCullough came across the theory, but it seems popular among the Q-Anon conspiracy crowd on Twitter. Naturally, some believer in the theory (or troll) temporarily edited Harris’s Wikipedia page. Or possibly it came from the pro-Trump Twitter personality Terrence K. Williams, who refers to Smollett as Harris’s ‘crazy nephew.'”

Called out on the fake news, McCullough deleted the tweet, then argued that Harris had called the now-disproven attack a “modern-day lynching,” for which he was lambasted.

“Is this meant to defend your provably false allegations?” the host was challenged.

“It’s meant — to openly demonstrate the left’s entirely one-sided worldview. Harris leaves up an inflammatory tweet for 23 days that effects crime, public safety, millions of $$$ in police costs, etc. Her supports have complete meltdowns over rumors that are up for two hours,” he snapped back

Actor Terrence Howard, who plays the father of Jussie Smollett’s character on “Empire,” has expressed support for his fellow cast member amid allegations that Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself.

Howard, who plays music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox television series, took to Instagram and posted a video of Smollett holding a giggling baby boy with the message: “All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.”

The post on Saturday came a day after “Empire” producers announced that Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, would be removed from the final two episodes of the season, saying cast and crew were affected and they made the move “to avoid further disruption on the set.”

The series, which is on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. Seven episodes were already completed before Smollett was charged last week with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

Police say Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed two masked men attacked him last month in downtown Chicago, hurling slurs and looping a rope around his neck. Investigators say he planned the hoax, soliciting the help of a friend and the friend’s brother, because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett denies the allegations.

Some “Empire” cast members posted supportive messages on social media after Smollett claimed he was attacked. Fox also publicly supported Smollett after the initial claims.

Howard’s post generated more than 385,000 views by midday Sunday and countless comments, both critical and supportive.

In response to one of the critics, Howard wrote: “sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie that I know. The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgement is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I’ve called my son for 5 years. It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.”

New Details About The Under Armour CEO — And His Rumored Affair,[],https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/styles/listing_big/public/image_blog/Kevin-Plank-hed.jpg?itok=jrm9Ecic,"['ruhle', 'company', 'plank', 'kevin', 'affair', 'rumored', 'journal', 'money', 'ceo', 'armour', 'mr', 'relationship', 'details', 'unusual']","He was probed about using company money for the affair.

Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is making headlines for an alleged affair with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle.

A Wall Street Journal report published Thursday detailed the ""unusual"" relationship between Plank, 46, and the news host, including how he was reportedly asked if he used company money for the affair. The article by Khadeeja Safdar, headlined, “Meet Under Armour CEO’s Unusual Adviser: An MSNBC Anchor,” dove into Ruhle's ""unusual and problematic"" involvement in the company as told by Under Armour employees.

So who is Kevin Plank? Here's what we know so far about Plank and his alleged romantic relationship with Ruhle.

1. He's married.

Plank has been married to Desiree Jacqueline Guerzon since 2003. They live with their two children in a $4 million home just outside of Baltimore, where Under Armour is based.

Ruhle is also married. She is the wife of Andy Hubbard, a co-CEO at the hedge fund HausMart.

Instagram

2. Ruhle advised Plank on many issues.

""Ms. Ruhle has traveled with Mr. Plank and Under Armour staff on his private jet, they said, and given the CEO her input on a range of business matters,"" The Journal reported. Some employees even claimed Ruhle's input affected the company more than its own employees.

“She also gave advice on how he should engage with President Trump in 2017 that was at odds with some executives who urged Mr. Plank to keep his distance,” The Journal reported. During a bout of criticism over a pair of Under Armour shoes, employees claim they were told by the company to not respond to backlash on social media until Ruhle spoke about the sneakers on her segment, which the company denied.

""To suggest that we waited to respond for a particular reporter is ridiculous,"" Under Armour's senior vice president of communications Kelley McCormick told the Journal. ""We wasted no time in defending our brand.""

McCormick also said that it was ""absurd"" to suggest Plank ""uniquely listens to any one individual.""

Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was questioned last year by the company's board over his ties to MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle, who has traveled on his private jet and provided input on a range of business matters, according to current and former executives https://t.co/nf7fSM2eAT — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) February 21, 2019

3. Many believe the two were romantically involved.

According to the Wall Street Journal, emails presented to the Under Armour's board last year proved Plank and Ruhle had a relationship that extended past business, but it is unclear if they were ever questioned about it after Plank said he had never used company money to support the relationship.

""Former and current executives said Mr. Plank's use of the jet and his relationship with Ms. Ruhle were among the many ways the CEO blurred the lines between his personal activities and Under Armour,"" The Journal reported. Despite hauling her around on a private jet, Plank said any money spent on Ruhle came out of his own pocket.

""Ms. Ruhle’s involvement at the Baltimore company was unusual and problematic, these people said, and left employees unsure how to handle her feedback because many people believed she was romantically involved with Mr. Plank,"" according to The Journal. Neither Plank nor Ruhle has addressed the rumors and it is unclear if they have affected their marriages.

Twitter

4. Under Armour denied the rumored affair.

McCormick denied the CEO and news host were anything more than companions.

""Mr. Plank and Ms. Ruhle are friends,"" she said.

Facebook

5. Others have called the allegations lies.

Thomas Farley defended Ruhle on Twitter, saying he has sought advice from her on multiple occasions over the last 201 years and called the WSJ's ""tabloid"" story ""sexist.""

""I have known @sruhle for 10 years. This is a total hit job and completely unfair,"" William Cohan tweeted in response to Farley. ""She loves her family more than anything. Where is the editorial control on suggesting innuendo without any evidence?""

I have known @sruhle for 10 years. This is a total hit job and completely unfair. She loves her family more than anything. Where is the editorial control on suggesting innuendo without any evidence? @ThomasFarley is right. https://t.co/5URLefq3hZ — William D. Cohan (@WilliamCohan) February 21, 2019

6. His mother was a Maryland mayor.

Plank's mother, Jayne Plank, was the first female mayor of Kensington, MD. She juggled the position and raising five boys and held her status as mayor for four terms.

Re: “Smollett charged with faking his own assault” (Page A4, Feb. 21):

I believe the whole of America will agree with me that Jussie Smollett’s alleged hoax was a disgrace to the nation.

I hope this story will teach our politicians valuable lessons about thinking and examining the facts before running their mouths.

Jussie is culpable in a crime and he should be punished.

A cheque showing that amount and made payable from the Empire star’s account to one of the men, Abimbola Osundairo, also has “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go)” written in the memo line, TMZ reported on Sunday.

According to the New York Post, police and prosecutors said the checque, dated January 23, is evidence that the 36-year-old paid Osundairo and his brother Olabinjo to carry out the hoax assault in Chicago six days later.

But sources told TMZ that the payment was really for training to help Smollett get into shape for a music video for his song, “Don’t Go.”

The singer-songwriter wanted to lose weight for the video — because he was supposed to appear shirtless in it — so he hired Abimbola, a jacked bodybuilder whom he knew from the gym and called “Bon.”

Other evidence weighing in Smollett’s favour are a series of texts between him and “Bon” beginning on January 20, which outlined a healthy meal plan including chicken thigh, Starkist tuna, eggs and peanut butter and various fruit.

“This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss,” Abimbola texted Smollett.

Another one, dated Jan. 28 — hours before the attack, the gym buff wrote to Smollett, “I know you’re travelling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

The $US3500 ($A4900) total cheque accounted for $US600-a-week ($A841) for five weeks of the workout plan and $US100-a-week ($A140) for the food plan, also for five weeks, sources told TMZ.

Another text seems to show that “Don’t Go” was slated to film on February 23. Meanwhile, a screenshot from Venmo shows Smollett had paid “Bola” $US100 ($A140) on September 27 for “training” — potentially giving credence to the actor’s claims that the $US3500 ($A4900) wasn’t related to the January 29 “attack.”

Both brothers testified before a grand jury that the payment was for training.

Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He is free after posting 10 per cent of $US100,000 ($A140,000) bond.

It comes Smollett’s Empire co-star Terrence Howard backed his friend, telling fans “the Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious.”

Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on Empire, voiced his support for his on-screen son in an Instagram post on the weekend.

“All your lil homies got you … We love the hell outta you,” Howard captioned a video showing the 36-year-old actor playing with Howard’s young son, Hero.

Howard also fiercely defended Smollett against fans who were critical of his support.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he wrote in a reply to one fan. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Days after Chicago prosecutors extensively laid out how Jussie Smollett allegedly planned a hate-crime attack against himself, his Empire co-star, Terrence Howard, is supporting and defending his television son in the midst of Smollett’s ongoing investigation. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” Howard wrote on Instagram. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years.

There’s nothing more harmful than a real friend!” Howard also posted a video of Smollett playfully chillin’ with a baby.

Smollett’s future within the Empire universe is currently up in the air. Reports indicate that the Fox drama is seriously considering recasting his role of Jamal Lyon, while in the meantime, he was cut from the final two episodes of this season in order to “avoid further disruption on set” after the “disturbing allegations” against him came to light. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” the show’s creatives said. “We are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

Smollett was charged last week with making a false police report, which is a felony disorderly conduct charge that could bring jail time and/or monetary fines. Smollett was subsequently released on a $100,000 bond, and he had to relinquish his passport. He will appear again in court in March."

Howard also cautioned another commenter who disapproved of him continuing to publicly support Smollett.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” Howard said in a lengthy reply. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly.

Howard also pointed out that it’s not the job of social media to judge Smollett.

On Friday, Fox announced that it had suspended Smollett and removed his character from the last two episodes of Season 5 following the “Empire” actor’s indictment and arrest on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.

Chicago police have accused him paying two men to attack him in January in what police say was an attempt to raise his profile because he wasn’t happy with his salary.

Empire’s Terrence Howard has a message for his co-star, Jussie Smollett: “We love the hell outta you.”

Howard took to his Instagram page to show his support for Smollett, who was recently charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report after claiming he was the victim of a brutal Jan. 29 attack.

While Chicago police allege Smollett fabricated the assault for publicity, the actor has maintained his innocence. He recently told his Empire castmates, “I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Smollett has been dropped from the remainder of the fifth season of the popular show while his case makes its way through the legal system, but that didn’t prevent Howard from defending his friend.

After sharing a too-cute video of Smollett playing with his son, Hero, Howard replied to fans who accused the singer of lying about his assault.

“The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” Howard wrote on Instagram. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.”

The Best Man star also had a little advice for those rushing to judgment about Smollett.

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years,” Howard wrote. “It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”"

Howard’s online support was criticized by some, according to reports. When one commenter said Howard was supporting a “lying felon,” Howard issued a lengthy response.

Howard is not alone in defending his friend. Smollett’s Empire co-star Gabourey Sidibe expressed her support in an Instagram post made a day before his arrest. It has since been deleted. The Sidibe post said, “I know him, I believe him, I stand with him.”"

Trump being a racist, when 50 million Americans have been brainwashed by the media to believe that he is one? In fact, before he ran for POTUS, there was never any mention of it ever, because he’s quite the opposite – a fair, just, and considerate human being. It’s all been a media hoax that’s been scripted, staged, and perpetuated with propaganda, just like the Jussie Smollett lynching hoax. Can you see it now?

There is a formula for insanity in America, and it’s mixed carefully and methodically, then “prescribed” to the masses. Nothing else would explain why tens of millions of Americans would literally murder a Trump fan in cold blood if they knew they could get away with it, right now. Any sane, responsible person who’s not doped up and dosed up on chemicals and propaganda would not have so much rage built up inside them over a couple years of political rip-rap.

There were plenty of Americans who figured out that Obama was a traitor who sought the destruction of the Republic, yet still, we weren’t all going around mauling Obama fans to vent our frustrations, or staging hate crimes for attention and to fuel dissonance and division in our country. The Left is wrought with triggered freaks acting like neanderthals with their smart phones. Oh, the irony of it all.

The formula for insanity boils down to a combination of toxic food, toxic medicine, and toxic news

It all boils down to a combination of toxic food, toxic medicine, and toxic news, that’s all repeatedly “consumed” for months, and even years on end. To date, not one single Trump supporter has outright started a riot, murdered anyone for not supporting Trump, or staged a hate crime to make it look like they were attacked by the Left. Not one.

Yet we see hundreds of hate crimes coming from the Left. We see real ones from Black Lives Matter and Antifa, all funded by you-know-who (Nazi-Sympathizing Billionaire George Soros). We see fake hate crimes planned, funded, staged, and then blasted across mass media (MSM) and all of social media like a Blitzkrieg, with no proof they’re real, from the Covington Catholic School “MAGA” teens to the latest with Jussie “Black on Black” Smollett.

And why do 50 million Americans believe all these lies, propaganda, staged events, and funded domestic-terrorism propagated from the Left? Well, because the message is repeated a million times over, while all the Democrats are doped up on chemicals. It’s a simple formula for simple minds that watch the boob tube over their GMO dinner each night, and who all read the bloody newspapers, thinking all fake news is real. They know nothing of real news. It never reaches them. They wouldn’t believe it if it did.

Did you know heavy metal toxins impair cognitive ability? The high doses of mercury in the influenza vaccine aren’t there because it’s the only preservative the vaccine industry can use to keep bacteria out of the multi-use jabs. No. That “thimerosal” is in there to dumb down society so the sheeple will believe the mentally challenged fake news on CNN. Why do you think CNN is the only news on TV at every airport, bus station, and train terminal in the USA?

Did you know that most prescription medications don’t work at all? They are designed in laboratories to cause horrific side effects. That’s not some byproduct or rare happenstance after taking your medication “as directed.” Nope. Brain fog, dizziness, depression, anxiety, irritable bowels, drowsiness, headaches, and trouble sleeping are all part of the design. That’s what keeps the masses from engaging in any critical thinking that may have them challenge the shallow “official narrative” that’s plastered across all media. Get it?

It’s all about ignorant, emotional reactions to fake news on a daily basis – and it’s all controlled by the Tech Giants and the Deep State

Did you know consuming chemical pesticides affects your ability to rationalize, communicate, navigate, and remember previous events? Even pollinators, like bees, lose their way and fail to do their job correctly when dosed with toxic neonicotinoids, a very popular, systemic agricultural pesticide.

All genetically modified U.S. crops contain pesticides inside the genetic makeup of the seeds and plants, so you cannot wash off that poison. This fuels confusion, memory lapse, and yes, dementia. Still blaming and hating on Trump?

Did you know that the fluoride in most U.S. tap water lowers IQ? Same goes for canola oil. It sure does. In-depth research already proves both of those points as scientific fact.

Have you noticed over the past two years, that if you are a Trump supporter, and you are accused of a crime, you are GUILTY until proven innocent (you’re basically tried and torched by the media immediately and relentlessly); however, if you are a Trump hater and you are accused of a crime, you are INNOCENT until proven guilty, and the media bastardizes, censors and blacklists anyone who says otherwise?

The evil MEDIA SPIN controls 50 million or more American sheeple right now – will they wake up before they’re doomed forever?

That, my friends, is called the media spin. The controlled narrative. The official narrative, and CNN, New York Times, and the ultimate rag Washington Post, are always the first to jump on the hoax train and find the Right guilty and the Left innocent, of everything.

Remember the Bret Kavanaugh “scandal?” Then, just last month, when three lead Democrat politicians from Virginia were all accused of racism and horrendous crimes, including sexual assault charges, the media said they were all innocent. Even when they get caught, you never see the fake news media or any celebrities retract, apologize, or recant their lies and propaganda. They just go silent.

The formula for insanity only works, though, if you take it. So, if you just eat organic food, tune into truth media, use natural remedies for immune building and ailments, then you will be able to think critically and know the difference between freedom and total tyranny.

Authorities released new information about a Michigan mother who shot her three children and then herself with a hunting rifle in a triple murder-suicide.

The fatal shootings of Alaina Rau, 2, Cassidy Rodery, 6, and Kyrie Roder, 9, were homicides and the shooting death of their mother, 28-year-old Aubrianne Moore, 28, was a suicide, the Kent County Medical Examiner ruled Wednesday, according to WOODTV. The four bodies were discovered around 3 p.m. on Monday in Solon Township, about 25 miles north of Grand Rapids.

""I've been with the sheriff's department for 29 years,"" said Kent County Sheriff Michelle LaJoye-Young. ""This is one of the hardest cases I've ever hear about. This is a very difficult case. Our investigators are feeling it. It's heartbreaking that something like this happened in our community.""

So who is Aubrianne Moore and why did she kill her kids? Here's what we know so far.

1. Moore picked the kids up from school early.

LaJoye-Young said that Moore checked Cassidy and Kyrie out of school around noon on Monday. She took them to lunch and then stopped at a property that belonged to the girls' great-grandparents on 19 Mile Road near Division Avenue in Solon Township, he said.

2. The mother shot her daughters in a wooded area.

Authorities said Moore used her boyfriend's legal bolt-action hunting-style rifle to shoot and kill her three daughters. LaJoye-Young said investigators found three shell casings in a wooded area behind the house.

3. She shot herself at her boyfriend's property.

The sheriff said that after Moore shot and killed her children, she put their bodies in the trunk of her car and drove down the road to her boyfriend's property, where she shot herself outside of the vehicle.

""We were able to pretty accurately put together the timeline of everything that happened from the time the kids were picked up from school until the time the bodies were found, so we’re very certain that there wasn’t any opportunity for anyone else (to be involved). Plus the ballistics were consistent with the suicide in the three murders,"" LaJoye-Young said.

Family members have identified the three children and the woman found dead in Michigan today. They are 2-year-old Alanah Moore, 6-year-old Cassidy Graham and 8-year-old Kyrie Graham and Aubrianne Moore. https://t.co/AWjPaxIbAz — WKRG (@WKRG) February 19, 2019

4. She had a history of mental illness.

In September, a social worker filed a petition to have More committed to a psychiatric hospital, WLNS reported.

“I believe the individual has mental illness and as a result of that mental illness the individual can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure self or others and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that are substantially supportive of this expectation,” the petition reads.

The petition said Moore suffered from hallucinations and heard voices and was a danger to herself and others.

“Aubrianne is keeping her kids home from school because the television told her there would be a school bus accident today,” the social worker wrote. “Aubrianne stays awake at night believing people will break into her home. Aubrianne is not eating believing food is being poisoned.”

Moore was diagnosed with ""unspecified schizophrenia"" by a Forest View doctor and ordered to be hospitalized “up to 60 days, followed by alternative treatment up to 90 days,” court records show. The records indicate that Moore agreed to be hospitalized at Forest View Psychiatric Hospital in Grand Rapids Township, although it is unclear how long she was there or if she sought additional treatment, according to WZZM13.

5. She believed she was protecting her children from some kind of threat.

Moore did not leave a suicide note but according to her recent writings, she was afraid of some sort of threat that didn't exist, LaJoye-Young said.

""She believes she was protecting the kids from something and most of her writings really followed kind of in that line,"" LaJoye-Young said. ""I don't know what else to say. There's no good answer here.""

Facebook

6. A GoFundMe was set up to raise money for the funeral costs.

A fundraiser was set up by the girls' uncle, Joseph Graham, to cover the costs of the funerals. As of Friday, $9,000 of Graham's $15,000 goal was raised.

""My name is Joseph Graham and on Monday, 02/18/2019, I was interrupted doing homework to receive the worst and most heartbreaking news I could have ever imagined,"" Graham wrote. ""I lost my nieces, and the world lost 3 beautiful angels; Kyrie Rodery (8), Cassidy Rodery (6), and Alaina Rau (2). No one understands and no one ever will understand but what I am trying to accomplish is to give my family and the Rau family some sort of support. At the very least I’m praying to cover funeral costs with this, but anything in excess will be used for legal purposes (trying to figure out how Aubrianne was neglected by doctors and treated to a lesser degree of help than what she needed). My family is not the only one who is suffering, though.

""Another man named Steven Rau lost his daughter Alaina and he lost his girlfriend, Aubrianne Moore, who was failed by the system,"" he continues. ""Steven and countless others from his family and friends are affected. There is no set number amount of people hurt because this should affect everyone who reads it. If all you can do is pray and pass the word on, we can prevent this from ever happening again.

""The big goal is 15K but my entire family and the entire Rau family would appreciate 50 dollars or even 5. Even if all you can spare is some prayers, that’s equally as appreciated. Please pass this on and please pray for the Rau family and my family and the community of Cedar Springs and all surrounding communities. God bless you all for so much as even reading this story.

And most importantly of all.... never let the world forget the names Kyrie Rodery, Cassidy Rodery, and Alaina Rau.""

As CrimeOnline previously reported, Chicago police said on Thursday that they were in possession of a $3,500 check Smollett made out to brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, who were arrested earlier this month and testified before a grand jury about their role in the alleged hate crime hoax. Authorities indicated the check represented payment for the allegedly orchestrated attack, but TMZ now reports that the memo on the check suggests otherwise.

TMZ has reportedly obtained documents showing that the memo on the $3,500 check, made out to Abel Osundairo, reads: “5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.”

According to the report, “Don’t Go” is a reference to a music video Smollett was scheduled to film in February, and he wanted to lose weight before the video shoot.

The Osundairo brothers are both believed to be heavily involved in physical fitness and boxing, and one or both may work out in the gym in Smollett’s apartment building. TMZ also reportedly saw text messages between Smollett and Abel Osundairo discussing his diet and fitness regimen.

According to the news outlet, Smollett has paid Osundairo for “training” at least once before — but only for $100. He reportedly transferred that amount to Osundairo in September via Venmo.

Authorities have not commented on the memo written on the$3,500 check. The “Empire” actor was charged this week with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a police report. Through his lawyers, Smollett has thus far maintained his innocence. He was released from jail on a $100,000 bond on Friday.

Howard initially posted a video to Instagram on Saturday night featuring Smollett with a baby. The post was captioned, “All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you ♥️.”

After a commenter criticized him for supporting a “lying felon,” Howard responded with a lengthy comment of his own in defense of Smollett.

“The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly,” he said. “His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend!”

Smollett’s fellow co-star Gabourey Sidibe had previously expressed her support for him throughout his legal trouble. In a since-deleted Instagram post one day before Smollett’s arrest, Sidibe wrote, “I know him, I believe him, I stand with him.”

As TVLine previously reported, Empire producers are considering bringing in a new actor to take over the role of Jamal Lyon in Season 6, should the show get renewed. Fox previously chose to suspend Smollett, who will sit out the final two episodes of Season 5.

Smollett, who has played Jamal on the Fox drama since its debut, was arrested early Thursday in Chicago and faces a felony criminal charge of disorderly conduct/filing a false police report in connection with his alleged attack. At the time, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox maintained, “We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”"

After Jussie was accused of staging the hate crime, and subsequently charged with felony disorderly conduct, many public figures have spoken out about the bizarre story—including, Senator Kamala Harris.

Harris, who after finding out Smollett had been attacked hailed him as one of the “kindest” and “most gentle human beings” she knows, now says she is “disappointed.”

“Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I’m sad, frustrated and disappointed. When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward,” she wrote in a statement, according to The Grio.

Despite frustration with Smollett, Harris doesn’t want us to forget that hate crimes are on the rise, stating “At the same time, we must speak the truth: hate crimes are on the rise in America. Just last year, the FBI released statistics that revealed a 17 percent increase in the number of hate crimes in America.Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address. We should not allow that. I will always condemn racism and homophobia. We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice. That is what I will keep fighting for.”

Kelly returned to court Monday for his second hearing since his arrest Friday on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The singer, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, learned the name of the judge who would preside over his trial: Cook County Associate Judge Lawrence Flood.

Meanwhile, a lawyer for R. Kelly says the singer may not post bail until Monday or Tuesday.

On Sunday, the singer's defense attorney, Steve Greenberg, told the Associated Press that Kelly is capable of making his bail payment of $100,000 – or 10 percent of his $1 million bond. But Greenberg said others have to act for Kelly, and the coordination is complicated because Kelly is behind bars.

""He has to rely on others acting on his behalf,"" Greenberg explained, ""and it's just not that easy – because he's in jail.""

According to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office website, he is being housed in Division 8 of the 7,000-inmate facility. Chicago defense attorney Joseph Lopez told the Associated Press that is where inmates at risk for harm from the general population are held.

Bond can be paid by credit card or cash. But if Kelly is planning on writing a check to cover the $100,000, he's going to have to cool his heels until his financial institution can confirm to court officials that he has the funds available to cover that amount, Lopez said.

During the singer's bond hearing on Saturday, Greenberg told the judge that the singer's finances are ""a mess"" and argued that Kelly isn’t wealthy despite decades of songwriting success. He attributed his client's financial woes on mismanagement, bad contracts and other issues.

Attorney Michael Avenatti tweeted Monday morning that a “second video showing R. Kelly engaged in sexual assault of a minor” would be released to prosecutors. Citing indictment documents, USA TODAY previously reported that some of the charges stemmed from a newly discovered video found by Avenatti.

“This tape was recently uncovered in connection with our ongoing nationwide investigation on behalf of victims,” Avenatti continued.

Kelly's $1 million bail was set by John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., the same judge who handled ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's bond a day earlier. Greenberg later told the AP that he had prepared himself for a figure higher than that but was ""pleased"" with that sum.

Lyke, who forbade Kelly from having contact with women under the age of 18, called the allegations against the singer ""disturbing"" and said the bail amount equals $250,000 for each of the four people Kelly is charged with abusing. The singer stared at the floor as the judge spoke,

A prosecutor told the judge Kelly met with one of the people he's charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial. The accuser gave law enforcement a shirt that had Kelly's DNA on it, the prosecutor said.

Kelly, who was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008, has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.

During a press conference after the hearing, Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx provided more details on the accusers, which include Kelly's then-24-year-old hairdresser, two 16-year-olds and one person who was 14 years old at the time of the first alleged incident. The multiple alleged criminal acts of sexual assault date back to 1998.

Greenberg rejected the allegations to reporters Saturday, saying, ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

Kelly, 52, surrendered to police at 8:15 p.m. Friday night, hours after being charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Greenberg has denied Kelly is a flight risk, telling the bond judge, ""Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn't like to fly,"" paraphrasing the lyrics of Grammy-award winner's hit ""I Believe I Can Fly.""

The real victims are taxpayers who paid for an empty investigation; and police officers, who are not only tasked with securing public safety, but also the public's trust. The real victims are the community, pastors, activists and parents working tirelessly to reverse an image that Chicago is a violent, uninhabitable city. Smollett owes them all an apology.

CHICAGO'S LEADERS SLAM SMOLLETT, BLAST CELEBS WHO DEFEND HIM

Perhaps Smollett is too absorbed in his own privilege to have any awareness of the real racism endured by African Americans in Chicago. Our city continues to suffer from the effects of residential and retail redlining, chronic neighborhood disinvestment and long-term segregation causing housing and education inequity. Hundreds of murders have gone unsolved and unreported by the media, while our schools are closing as low-income families flee crime and violence. A city toiling to preserve the humanity of its residents and maintain our dignity in the national media is the backdrop against which Smollett has launched his attack on the City of Chicago and further disillusioned the youth who look up to him.

Perhaps just as bad is the fact that the elected Cook County State’s Attorney, Kim Foxx, has recused herself from this controversial case. At a time when voters need to hear from her as to how and why charges were brought against Smollett, Foxx decided instead to fly out to Hollywood for a few parties ahead of the Academy Awards.

I keep reiterating that Chicago needs to have public discussions on race that are based on hard truths and solemn commitments to change. But this tabloid story undermines our focus on criminal justice reform and the hundreds of non-violent detainees sitting in Cook County jails because they cannot afford bail. I also believe Chicago needs data-driven policing strategies to keep us all safe. Smollett’s hoax introduces false data that perpetuates profiling and political conflict. In short, Smollett has endeavored to undermine our trust in one another and our government agencies.

CHICAGO TURNS ON SMOLLETT, CLAIMS HE HURTS REAL VICTIMS

Nonetheless, I’m certain we will emerge from this assault on our collective character as a more united community. Indeed, if the future of Chicago belongs to young Chicagoans, I know that we will prevail against any attempt to take us back to a dark era of false justice.

In the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting and jury trial of officer Jason Van Dyke, Smollett’s selfish reach for headlines could’ve incited new threats of racial violence and fostered racial polarization. That’s why I’m calling for Smollett to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Lastly, I believe Smollett was attempting to influence our elections by implying Trump supporters attacked him. I strongly recommend that investigators interrogate him on his broader motives for the hoax. I reject the notion that this was done solely for the purpose of netting him more fame and fortune.

Here’s what we’ve learned from the alleged Smollett hoax: First, Chicago’s detective division is pretty darn good. Kudos to them for finding the truth. Second, Chicago may be a national battleground for police and criminal justice reform. This is an opportunity for us to lead on these important issues.

Third, we’ve learned that Chicago is ready for change. We’re tired of being led by our fears of one another.

Now is the time to deliver on the promise of Harold Washington, Jane Addams and pioneers of hope whose legacies live so large in our hearts there remains little room, even for a figure as small as Jussie Smollett."

Now, with Smollett’s recent arrest and subsequent release, his legal team is likely working overtime to develop a defense strategy. But with all the evidence currently available to the public, it is difficult to know whether any of these strategies would truly persuade a jury.

Here are three possible defense strategies.

He did not commit the alleged crime

The most straightforward strategy is simply asserting that he did not file a false police report and that he was not involved in orchestrating the Jan. 29, 2019, hate crime. Ultimately, Jussie would have to argue and prove that if Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo — the two brothers of Nigerian descent who have both made acting appearances on “Empire” and been known to socialize with Smollett — were indeed the individuals who attacked him on Jan. 29, that he had no knowledge of and was in no way involved in their plan to assault him.

Not guilty by reason of insanity

The trickier strategy would be to raise an insanity defense under the theory of “irresistible impulse,” which applies to someone who may know that an act is wrong but is unable to resist committing it. In 2007, Smollett was accused of misidentifying himself to a Los Angeles police officer who pulled him over for a DUI. He also signed a false name on the promise to appear in court, which resulted in him being charged with false impersonation. As evidence of a mental defect, Smollett could introduce his history of giving false information to the police to show a pattern of compulsive dishonest behavior.

The state has not met its burden of proof

The most viable strategy would be to simply argue that the prosecution did not present a legally sufficient evidentiary foundation, and then move for a directed verdict before the defense presents its case. A prosecutor is charged with proving that a criminal defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecutor does not meet this burden, then the case fails. To prove their case, the prosecution relies on evidence acquired by police officers during an investigation. Now let’s be honest, the crooked Chicago cop is not just a trope portrayed on the television and movie screens. There is a documented history of police tampering with evidence. Just last September, a Cook County judge overturned the convictions of 18 men who were victims of a corrupt group of Chicago police officers who fabricated and falsified evidence for more than a decade. Thus, dismantling the prosecution’s case on the grounds of inauthentic, insufficient or inadequate evidence is a plausible legal strategy that could be used for Smollett’s defense.

Although he has been found guilty by many “jurors” in the court of public opinion, it is the court of law that will make the final determination of Smollett’s guilt or innocence."

On Thursday, the producers of “Empire” decided to cut Jussie Smollett from the show’s final two episodes. They announced the decision by saying, “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

They continued, “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett was released from custody on Thursday after posting $100,000 bail."

However, all of the facts apparently still have not come forward and now the FBI is challenging reports from the notoriously corrupt Chicago Police Department.

Chicago Police Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a long press conference that the “Empire” actor wrote the hateful Jan. 22 letter to himself. See below:

""Jussie Smollett You will die black fag"" Okay, I'm ready to fight. pic.twitter.com/h42Px47lvW — ℝ𝕚𝕔𝕙 ℍ𝕠𝕞𝕠 ℚ𝕦𝕒𝕟 (@Homiekage) January 29, 2019

However, TMZ is reporting the FBI said the Chicago Police were “overstating” when they said Jussie sent the letter to himself. One federal law enforcement source told TMZ, “I think he [Johnson] went too far. We’re not there yet.”

TMZ also reports, “We’re told authorities are trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the letter. They’re also checking the postage stamp against the stamps found in the brothers’ apartment.” The Nigerian brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, denied sending the letter.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson may have also gone too far when he said Jussie paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack. TMZ reports they “obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ‘attack.’ The memo line reads, ‘5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don’t Go.'” “Don’t Go” is a song for a music video where he would appear shirtless.

TMZ also reports, “There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 — the day before the ‘attack’ — Bon [Abel Osundairo] wrote, ‘I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.’ Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ‘This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.'” The $3,500 breakdown was reportedly “$600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks,” according to TMZ reports.

Smollett lawyers released the following statement on Thursday after his arrest:

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

On Jan. 29, while walking to a subway, Smollett claimed two men yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Smollett was released on $100,000 bond.

The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged. At this point, Smollett is part of the seven already completed episodes.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

Smollett then adds: 'Aw, he's such a sweet baby.'

The 36-year-old actor was arrested last week and charged with filing a false police report of a hate crime.

He claimed two white men wearing cornered him around 2am in Chicago on January 29.

Smollett said the men threw bleach on him, tied a noose around his neck and yelled 'f****t', 'n****r' and 'This is MAGA country!'

However, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett made up the attack.

Police added that they believe Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to pretend to attack him because he was upset with his salary on Empire.

According to a Variety report from 2016, Smollett made about $20,000 per episode while co-stars Howard and Taraji P Henson - who plays his mother on the show - each made about $175,000 per episode.

Since Smollett's arrest, his other Empire co-stars have yet to make any public statements. Pictured, left to right: Howard's Lucious Lyon, Taraji P Henson's Cookie Lyon and Smollett's Jamal Lyon in a season 4 episode of Empire

TMZ reported that a check for a total of $3,500 written by Smollett to the two brothers states it was for a 'training fee'.

The memo line on the check reads: '5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.'

Sources reportedly told TMZ that Smollett paid $600 a week for a five-week workout plan and $100 a week for a five-week nutrition plan, which equals $3,500.

Allegedly, 'Don't Go' is a reference to a song that Smollett was going to appear in a music video for.

Smollett insists he is innocent and his attorneys say they plan to mount 'an aggressive defense'.

'Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,' his attorneys said in a statement.

Many fans commented on Howard's Instagram post, angry that he was defending his co-star.

'Sorry you feel that way but that's the only Jussie I know,' he replied to one comment.

'The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.

'Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I've called my son for five years. It's God's job to judge and it's ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.'

On Friday, Fox announced Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, was being written out of the last two episodes of season five.

Since Smollett's arrest, his other Empire co-stars have yet to make any public statements.

Social media users are now wondering, however, if Smollett was inspired for his alleged attack after Empire creator Lee Daniels revealed his cousin had been assaulted because he is gay.

Daniels posted a video on Instagram on January 10 condemning homophobia after his cousin was targeted and beaten because of his sexuality.

'This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories,' the Empire creator wrote alongside the video.

'It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better. We need to continue to remember to love and to turn against the hate that we’re seeing out there. But we all need to fight that fight together."

The Chicago police superintendent claimed that Jussie paid a $3,500 check to his alleged accomplices Abel and Ola Osundairo to stage the attack. Now, there's evidence that the check was simply payment to help the Empire actor get in shape.

The memo line reads ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go,"" according to documents obtained by TMZ. The check was written to Abel Osundairo on Jan. 23, six days before the attack. Sources say that there are several text messages between Smollett and Abel to prepare the entertainer for the video to his song ""Don't Go.""

This is also not the first time Smollett has tapped Abel for training sessions. The documents include screenshots of Osundairo and Smollett's Venmo interactions detailing at least one time where Jussie paid Abel $100 for a session in September 2018.

The brothers also told a grand jury that the money they received was for the workout/nutrition plan. While the evidence doesn't completely exonerate Jussie of allegedly fabricating his attack, it does cast additional doubt over the CPD's claims.

Terrence Howard has shown his support for Jussie Smollett after it was announced he would be cut from 'Empire'. The 49-year-old actor has spoken out in defence of his co-star - who is being investigated over reports he orchestrated an alleged homophobic and racist attack on himself - following the news producers have decided he will not be returning to set to shoot the final two episodes of the drama. Terrence shared a video of his son Hero playing with Jussie on a private jet, and wrote on Instagram: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you""

Producers are keen to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show, and so have simply written Jussie's character, Jamal Lyon, out of the finale.

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement to The Blast: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Jussie appeared in court on Thursday (21.02.19), where he was ordered to pay a $10,000 bond and surrender his passport after being arrested on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.

After the hearing, he headed straight to the Cinespace Studio in Chicago where he became ""very emotional"" as he maintained his innocence in a speech to the cast and crew of the show.

He reportedly said: ""I'm sorry I've put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I'm sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.""

Jussie was later praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

Chicago police charged Smollett this week with filing a false report for allegedly staging a Jan. 29 attack on himself and making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett has denied the charge.

Jussie Smollett has evidence that disputes allegations he paid two brothers $3,500 to help stage his hate attack, according to a new report.

A check showing that amount and made payable from the “Empire” star’s account to one of the men, Abimbola Osundairo, also has “5 week Nutrition/Workout program (Don’t Go)” written in the memo line, TMZ reported on Sunday.

Police and prosecutors said the check, dated Jan. 23, is evidence that the 36-year-old paid Osundairo and his brother Olabinjo to carry out the hoax assault in Chicago six days later.

But sources told TMZ that the payment was really for training to help Smollett get into shape for a music video for his song “Don’t Go.”

The 192-pound singer-songwriter wanted to lose 20 pounds for the video — because he was supposed to appear shirtless in it — so he hired Abimbola, a jacked bodybuilder whom he knew from the gym and called “Bon.”

Other evidence weighing in Smollett’s favor is a series of texts been him and “Bon” beginning on Jan. 20, which outlined a healthy meal plan including chicken thigh, Starkist tuna, eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter and various fruit.

“This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss,” Abimbola texted Smollett.

In another one, dated Jan. 28 — hours before the attack — the gym buff wrote to Smollett, “I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

The $3,500 total check accounted for $600 a week for five weeks of the workout plan and $100 a week for the food plan, also for five weeks, sources told TMZ.

Another text seems to show that “Don’t Go” was slated to film on Feb. 23. Meanwhile, a screenshot from Venmo shows Smollett had paid “Bola” $100 on Sept. 27 for “training” — potentially giving credence to the actor’s claims that the $3,500 wasn’t related to the Jan. 29 “attack.”

Both brothers testified before a grand jury that the payment was for training.

Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

He is free after posting 10 percent of $100,000 bond."

There’s a new development in the Jussie Smollett case that’s raising eyebrows. The Nigerian brothers accused of working alongside Jussie to concoct a fake hate crime apparently told a grand jury that the $3,500 check Jussie wrote them was indeed for personal training and NOT for that allegedly fictitious fistfight.

According to Abel and Ola Osundairo, the $3,500 check was written to Abel for a “5 week Nutrition/Workout program.” TMZ obtained official court documents that show the check was written six days before the “attack.”

TMZ also viewed texts that show Jussie and Abel a.k.a. “Bon” texting back and forth about training including one the day before the “attack” where Bon told Jussie;

“I know you’re traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.”

In another text Bon tells Jussie what he can eat; “chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker’s peanut butter” and in another Bon discusses projected fat loss.

Sources connected to Jussie are claiming that the strict diet was because Jussie wanted to lose 20 pounds before appearing shirtless in a music video for his track “Don’t Go.”

Do YOU think the police got it wrong here and Jussie really did pay the brothers to get slimmy trimmy—NOT to fake a hate crime?"

The comedian took to social media to declare despite the jokes, the black community needs to help the actor get through this tough time.

As the dust surrounding Jussie Smollett begins to settle, many have found solace in making jokes about the ordeal. Memes and gifs depicting the Empire actor as Pinocchio--the fictitious wooden doll who becomes a real boy whose nose grows with the lies he tells--have circulated the Internet.

Despite the LOLs that have come at the 36-year-old's expense, comedian Faizon Love says its time the black community rally behind the disgraced actor and help him through his tough times. Taking to social media Saturday, (Feb. 23) the 50-year-old boldly declared that Smollett may have messed up but he's still part of the community.

""Tell you the truth, he's our f--k up, and what I mean by that you can claim LGB barbecue, whatever that thing is called, you a part of the black community first, Jussie, "" Love said while smoking a cigar. ""

On January 29, Smollett alleged to have been attacked after leaving a Subway fast food restaurant by two MAGA wearing men. According to Smollett, the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs, threw bleach on him and attempted to tie a noose around his neck.

Following initial reports of the attack, celebrities, political figures, and entertainers took to social media demonstrating support for the openly gay actor. However, as the story unfolded, doubt began to cloud the allegations when the Chicago PD located the alleged attackers. The two men turned out to be brothers and claimed they were paid by the actor to stage the incident and instructed on which racial epithets to use. Footage later revealed them purchasing a rope and MAGA hat.

Smollett turned himself into police Thursday (Feb. 21) and faces a felony charge. Under Illinois law, Smollett may serve one to three years in prison for filing a false police report.

The Friday actor said despite his egregious mistake the support of the black community is needed.

And when you part of the black community, it's like a marriage: good, bad the ugly we still got you. So let that be a lesson to you. The black community, he's our f--k up. We must embrace him, let him get through these lumps and move the f--k on."""

According to TMZ, ‘Empire’ creator Lee Daniels posted an Instagram video on January 10 to call for an end to homophobic violence, citing a recent alleged attack against his cousin.

“This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories,” Daniels reportedly wrote in the social media post. Daniels discussed the incident and his feelings about it with cast and crew of the show, and they seemed to be affected by it, according to the report.

Sources who were present on set reportedly told TMZ they believe Smollett may have orchestrated the homophobic attack as a way of getting into Daniels’ good graces — perhaps resulting in a raise or an elevated position on the series. As CrimeOnline previously reported, authorities have accused Smollett of staging the purported hate crime because he wasn’t happy with what he was earning on the show.

On Friday, the New York Post reported that Smollett told authorities this week that he had an untreated drug problem. But court records show that he denied having any addition or mental health issues.

Some of the attempts were laughable: Don Lemon’s claim that Smollett’s handling of the whole PR aspect of the incident was possibly “not his fault” had to top the charts in that department.

Moving from the laughable to the pernicious, however, we had NPR’s Michel Martin, who seemed to indicate those inclined to criticize Smollett and the media’s credulity when it came to his case should instead remember two white murderers who blamed their crimes on black people, each over a quarter of a century ago.

“Today, I have two names for those tempted to gloat, despair, or be ashamed because of Jussie Smollett, the actor now accused of orchestrating a fake bias crime against himself,” Martin wrote in a piece aired Saturday on “All Things Considered.” “Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.”

“For those who don’t remember: In October 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car — after a childbirth class no less — and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife,” she continued. “The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart’s funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

“It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

“Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside,” Martin continued.

“She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.”

Martin noted that now that Smollett’s been arrested, “some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events.” (This is an odd definition of “glee,” but more on this later.) However, she points out that on the selfsame day, “federal prosecutors revealed that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target.”

This is mostly a scattershot piece by Martin that seems to have the effect trying to distract listeners from the very relevant fact that Jussie Smollett stands charged with igniting a sociopolitical firestorm over a hoax attack.

Leaving aside the Coast Guard officer’s arrest, which has been covered in no lack of depth, the piece boils down to what Stuart and Smith did back in 1989 and 1994, respectively, and how it means we oughtn’t be “tempted to gloat” (read: report the facts) of the case. Let’s set the record straight how these stories diverge and diverge wildly.

First, while both the stories mentioned by NPR garnered national attention, they were not perpetrated by figures who were of national import before they committed crimes. Smollett is a man who was famous before this happened — although apparently not famous enough to get the pay raise he wanted, which was apparently the reasoning behind this whole mess.

Second, Stuart and Smith brought black individuals into their narratives to cover up their own crimes — which were very real. Pretty clearly, these were murderers with mental issues.

In the Smollett case, however, without the entirely fictional white racists who allegedly assaulted Smollett, there would have been no crime reported. Is this really who Martin wants to be comparing Smollett to?

RELATED: Coronavirus Silver Lining: Playboy Magazine's Print Edition Is No More

Third, I don’t know whether Stuart or Smith sought to vilify black Americans through their stories as a primary goal. Were they racists? Quite possibly. They were certainly worse things.

However, nobody’s ever proved that what they did was set out to discredit people because of their race. Smollett’s case, if we’re to believe prosecutors, was all about discrediting President Donald Trump’s supporters; the entire setup was tailor-made so that these two fictive white, racist thugs would be seen as a synecdoche for all white conservatives in general and Trump supporters in particular.

And the media bought it: Witness CNN’s Brooke Baldwin, who infamously said of Smollett’s accusation, “This is America in 2019.” It was, although not quite the way she was implying.

Finally, whenever a conservative points out that Smollett used an alleged hoax to smear conservatives at large as violent, racist homophobes and that the media bought into this story without doing any due diligence until it became evident nothing in Smollett’s narrative cohered, we’re accused of “gloating” or acting in a “gleeful” manner.

Believe me, nothing would make me happier than not having to report on this story. I take no pleasure in it and I certainly don’t seek to lord it over anyone.

I opine about it, the same way that almost every other conservative does, because we have a responsibility to address a broken media system that treated Smollett’s story as gospel without either video or a suspect and, now that he’s accused of perpetrating a vile racial hoax, seeks to do damage control for him.

We do this because that broken system no longer functions in service of the facts, only a narrative.

Pointing this out is now counts as “glee” or “gloating” — as if any other response other than us nodding our heads along to our media suzerains as they excoriate us and saying, “Well, you know, they have a point,” is somehow inappropriate.

Even if the cases Martin is writing about weren’t 25 and 30 years old, respectively, they’d still be irrelevant.

Days after Smollett was arrested on a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly filing a false police report, and then dropped from the final two episodes of this season of “Empire”, Howard took to Instagram to express his support to his onscreen son.

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you ♥️,” Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on the Fox series, wrote on Saturday. The video featured Smollett playing with the actor’s son, Hero, while on a private plane.

“He’s such a sweet baby,” Smollett can be heard saying in the clip as the little one cozies up to him.

Taye Diggs appeared to support Howard’s post, leaving the comment, “Atta boy!” Gabourey Sidibe also left three red hearts."

HUGE: Kamala Harris Was Allegedly Involved In Jussie Smollett’s “MAGA Country” Hoax ... One person who apparently has knowledge of the situation claims 2020 presidential hopeful Kamala Harris may be involved (link): “This puppy [Jussie Smollett] is tied to Kamala. There is a chance this will come out.... Would suggest for people to contact their representatives to have Kamala investigated. She is involved and wish I could tell you how I know. Just contact your reps and push for them to look into this. It may help.”

The link is to an anonymous comment at 4chan's /pol/ (Politically Incorrect) board.

Our Clover pal continues:

... But, why would Harris help Smollett stage an incident like this? Oh, that’s right: To make Trump supporters, as well as the POTUS himself, look even more “racist” than the media already portrays them to be. This would undoubtedly help not only her 2020 campaign, but her fellow Democratic contenders as well.

Updates to the post note that Smollett and Harris both attended a Martin Luther King Day rally in Los Angeles last year (though they don't appear to be together).

Also -- I hope you're sitting down for this -- another message board poster is quoted pointing out that Jussie Smollett's mother's maiden name is Harris. OMIGOD! That's such an unusual name! (Wikipedia says this is true.)

The much-updated post notes that both Kamala Harris and Cory Booker referred to the Smollett incident as ""an attempted modern-day lynching,"" then points out that Harris and Booker are (along with Tim Scott of South Carolina) co-sponsors of a bill to make lynching a federal crime. Clover guy/gal writes:

Was Booker involved too!?

So there's your theory: In order to attack President Trump and publicize their own campaigns, Harris and Booker, or maybe just Harris, conspired to help a TV star commit an easily exposed criminal act that would inevitably be a huge news story once his deception was revealed -- you know, as you do when you're a serious presidential contender.

This idea has spread on the right-wing fringes. Here it is being advanced on Twitter by a self-promoting author/film producer/""media personality"" named Tariq Nasheed. Nasheed's tweets were quoted in an American Thinker post by Monica Showalter. The conspiracy theory is being picked up by YouTube vloggers.

But yesterday the theory got a big boost when Rush Limbaugh put it on the air. From the transcript:

RUSH: Dansville, New York. Diana. It’s great to have you here. Hi. CALLER: Hi. I think that the whole Jussie Smollett incident kind of spider webs out a lot further than we’re seeing on the surface, because there’s no coincidence that Kamala Harris has been pushing her anti-lynching legislation. All of a sudden, you know, out of the blue, out of all the people in the world who supposedly get lynched, it just happens to be her personal friend, Jussie Smollett? RUSH: Yeah, I’ve got this story coming up. I was going to get to it in the next half hour and I wanted to take your call first to give you credit for creating the transition, because I think you are really on to something. She has made it known how close they are. She’s made it known that Smollett and her and Smollett’s family... All of these uber-left-wing, so-called social justice activists in California… They are all linked. It is an intricately woven web of deceit. Black Panthers to the New Black Panthers, to the Weather Underground and all of these people. Angela Davis and Kamala Harris, and all these people are all in on it — and she did. She has come out for reparations. I wouldn’t be surprised. We can’t, of course, say for certain here. But I wouldn’t be surprised at all to learn that this thing was part of a coordinated effort to assist her campaign, which is destined to do what? Defeat Donald Trump! I mean, you can cross a lot of T’s and dot a lot of I’s in this. I think you’re on to something. What gave the first clue that this might be something connected? CALLER: The whole thing just smelled really fishy to me. It’s way too coincidental — and, you know, there’s never coincidences with the Democrat Party. It’s all interweaved all the time. We’re always finding out how it’s so much more below the surface. RUSH: Well, that’s true. In fact, I’m on record as saying there’s no such thing as coincidences with the Clintons, for example, and that’s the Democrat Party subset. That’s fascinating that you have — just out of the blue — put these two together. Where did you find out that Smollett and Kamala Harris have a relationship? Where did you find that out? CALLER: Well, she was posting about it on the Internet, what close friends they were, and she was singing his praises, and, you know, calling it “a modern-day lynching.” RUSH: Right, it looked like it was almost orchestrated response, timed well to what then becomes a call for reparations. CALLER: Yeah, and she was... You know, she’s been pushing this anti-lynching legislation since last year, and I guess it’s gone through the Senate, but not through the House at this point, I guess. RUSH: Smollett, by the way, just did a documentary on lynching. CALLER: Really? RUSH: Yeah. By the way, I didn’t know that lynching was legal in America. Anti-lynching legislation? I thought it was already illegal. It shows you what I know.

And now your grandparents believe that this was A Conspiracy So Vast involving Kamala Harris.

Has Harris said that she has close ties to Smollett? I can't find any evidence of that. In her original Smollett tweet she called him ""one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" That's clearly a well-known person talking about another well-known person who's an acquaintance, not a close friend, much less a family friend.

Smollett did work on an episode of a cable series called America Divided that concerned lynching. Maybe that inspired his hoax. It suggests nothing about Harris (or Booker). That black Americans would be separately focused on racist violence is unimaginable to right-wingers -- if they're talking about lynching at the same time, it must be because they're in cahoots with one another.

You see how the paranoia works. Limbaugh said:

Black Panthers to the New Black Panthers, to the Weather Underground and all of these people. Angela Davis and Kamala Harris, and all these people are all in on it — and she did. She has come out for reparations.

All black people and allies who advocate racial justice, past and present, liberal and radical, are all part of one massive conspiracy that's coming for you, whitey!

I hear it's all explained on Michelle Obama's whitey tape.

We should have been cautious from the start,"['Deseret News', 'Kyle Dunphey', 'Ethan Bauer', 'Herb Scribner', 'Lois M. Collins', 'Lottie Elizabeth Johnson', 'Feb', 'Megan Mcardle', 'For The Washington Post']","https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/f3b7f10323.jpg?crop=top:0|left:0|width:1200|height:630&quality=100&resize=width:1200&order=resize,crop&c=14&a=19509ab9","['smolletts', 'narrative', 'theatrical', 'real', 'episode', 'start', 'megan', 'political', 'violence', 'cautious', 'serial', 'crimes', 'crime', 'victim', 'smollett', 'mcardle', 'jussie']","WASHINGTON — On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor, reported to Chicago police that he had been the victim of a vicious hate crime. As my colleague Nana Efua Mumford has noted, the disturbing details were almost cinematic, like an episode of ""Empire,"" Smollett's television show. Two masked assailants not only made homophobic, racist slurs, according to Smollett, but also poured an unknown chemical on him and hung a noose around his neck. One of the attackers shouted, ""This is MAGA country"" — as in the Trumpian phrase ""Make America Great Again.""

That theatricality, and the timeliness of the political message, ensured the incident would catch the public's imagination. Now, evidence is emerging that the episode may in fact have been scripted, by Smollett himself. On Wednesday evening, Chicago police announced that Smollet has been charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Smollett, through his attorneys, has denied participating in a hoax.

Regardless of how the Smollett episode ultimately turns out, it provides a useful reminder: The more a crime report sounds like a movie, the more suspicious you should be.

In Bill James' 2011 book, ""Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence,"" he notes of serial killers that ""one can almost say accurately that every serial killer in fiction is more organized than any serial killer in real life."" Another way to put it: Fictional killers are unrealistically legible to outside viewers. In real life, after investigating for a year and a half, Las Vegas police still have no idea why Stephen Paddock committed the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

James' dictum applies equally well to other sorts of crimes, particularly when the details seem to serve a larger political narrative.

Hollywood strips away ambiguity, clarifies murky motives and endows criminals with more planning ability than they usually possess. It heightens dramatic contrasts between villain and victim and festoons the crime with eye-catching symbolic detail. Real criminals, by contrast, rarely have a simple discernible motive or a narrative arc. Nor can they generally work their crimes up for maximum dramatic effect, because, unlike actors playing criminals on a closed movie set, the real ones need to worry about getting caught.

A look at the most extreme form of hate crimes — domestic right-wing terrorist attacks — reveals the distance between reality and what movies lead us to expect. There are relatively few of what we might call Hollywood Crimes, such as Timothy McVeigh's bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 or Dylann Roof's 2015 massacre in an African-American church at Charleston, South Carolina. Often, the information about the incidents and attackers is so convoluted that it's not even entirely clear they were primarily motivated by politics.

Or what politics motivate them. Remember the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016? It was initially assumed to be an episode of right-wing homophobic violence. Then the shooter turned out to be an Islamic State follower who may not even have realized he had targeted a gay nightclub until he got there. Real crime, like real life, is complicated and confusing.

And so our spidey sense should tingle when alleged crimes seem ready for prime time. The perpetrators of racial and sexual violence aren't writing a manifesto; they're committing assault. Those assaults will rarely be structured to deliver a simple, on-point story: The assault on a lone victim by stereotypically powerful perpetrators; the attackers who helpfully reveal their one-note motive and then shut up; the abundance of stunning detail; the unmistakable connection to a larger political narrative. Or the victim who, like an actor, sustains minimal physical injuries from an apparently gory episode.

These elements should have urged us to caution in the Smollett case right from the start. As they should have in famous recent cases we now know were hoaxes: the confabulated rape accusations against the Duke University men's lacrosse team in 2006 and a University of Virginia fraternity in 2014, or the rash of slightly-too-on-the-nose hate crime reports following President Donald Trump's election.

Paradoxically, though, bogus attacks may feel more authentic than actual ones because, luckily, most of us know these extreme forms of violence only from what we've seen on-screen. We amplify stories that tickle our narrative neurons, overlooking more complicated real attacks where the significance must be explained.

This does a grave disservice to real victims. If we focus on the stories that give us the narratives we're looking for, we're going to end up with a disproportionate amount of fiction. And when those widely publicized stories come unglued, we'll inadvertently feed another false narrative: that racial and sexual violence are fake news, instead of all-too-real problems."

A good portion of the credit must be appropriated to the dozens of private, business and city-owned security cameras that helped peel back Smollett’s shaky story like the skin off of fried chicken.

Investigators tell the media that they were suspicious of Smollett’s story right from the jump. But they kept up the facade that Smollett was a victim in order to keep Smollett from being alarmed and contacting the co-conspirators.

On January 29, 2018, Smollett said two men beat him up, threw a rope around his neck in the manner of a noose and poured a corrosive product over him, most presumably bleach. He also said the men yelled, “This is MAGA Country,” which recalls Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

The investigation took an unexpected detour when officers identified two Nigerian-born brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, as persons of interest. When cops arrested the pair on February 13 at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after returning from West Africa, officers said what the Osundairo brothers admitted to changed the “trajectory” of the investigation.

The Chicago Tribune said police counted 55 city, business and doorbell cameras that filmed snippets of the Osundairo brothers’ movements as they entered and retreated from the crime scene.

Most famously, police initially only had a grainy video that only revealed a silhouette of two men. But that simple, blurry image was the tiny piece of evidence that cracked the case wide open.

Strike one against Smollett.

The footage was just clear enough for the investigators to get the license plate number of the cab they hailed. That cab had a security camera inside the taxi that clearly showed the brothers’ faces.

Strike two against Smollett.

The Tribune said that cab delivered the brothers several miles away to the city’s North Side. They “abruptly stopped the cab” and began walking.

The newspaper later said the brothers then caught another taxi, which was also captured on camera. This cab let them out at their home, so police knew where the two lived and were later able to obtain a warrant to search the contents of their place.

At first, the Osundairo brothers refused to talk. But when officers threatened to charge them with a hate crime and told them the years they could get in prison, the brothers began squawking like parrots.

Strike three against Smollett.

Abel Osundairo, 25, identified Smollett as a close friend; he claimed to be Smollett’s personal trainer who also provided the actor with the club drug Ecstasy. Both brothers had worked as extras on the set of “Empire” and were paid $3500 to stage the Smollett-inspired hoax.

Speaking of drugs, the “Empire” star told police upon his arrest that he has a drug problem, which may be used as a way to mitigate the circumstances and possibly reduce his sentence, TMZ reported."

“All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,” Howard wrote in an Instagram post on Saturday that featured a video of Smollett tickling a baby.

Howard plays the role of fictional music mogul Lucious Lyon and the father of Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon in “Empire,” a TV drama series on Fox that debuted in 2015. Following Smollett’s arrest last week, Fox announced Smollett’s character had been cut from the final two episodes of the season.

Chicago police say Smollett, 36, paid two brothers to stage an attack against him last month in an attempt to boost his public profile because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire” salary.

Smollett had told police that two men attacked him during the early morning hours of Jan. 29. He said they wrapped a rope around his neck, shouted homophobic and racist slurs at him and poured bleach on him. He also said they told him, “This is MAGA country,” referring to President Donald Trump’s 2016 “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.

Police now say Smollett fabricated his story, and some fans slammed Howard for his continuing support of the actor. But the star of the 2004 film “Crash” responded by calling on critics to reserve their judgment.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” Howard wrote. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.”

He continued: “Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Police initially said the alleged assault was being investigated as a hate crime. And in the case’s immediate aftermath, Howard and a range of other celebrities and politicians rallied to Smollett’s side.

But after police tracked down and interviewed the two brothers they said were involved in the incident, authorities arrested Smollett on Wednesday and charged him with orchestrating it.

Smollett has denied staging the attack and maintains he was the victim of a hate crime.

The controversy has sparked backlash from LGBTQ and social justice advocacy groups who worry Smollett’s allegedly false police report will overshadow the real threats that beset their communities."

Njugush didn't propose to his wife

Comedian Njugush has revealed that he wedded his wife Celestine Ndunda aka 'Wakavinye' without proposing to her.

Njugush, who has scaled the ranks of fame, and along the journey stayed on course with his only sweetheart who stood by him, explained why he never got to propose. In an up-close television interview, Wakavinye recalled Njugush's weird proposal to her.

""He asked me whether we could have our wedding on December or August; that was his proposal,"" she said.

Njugush went on to explain why he felt proposing to Wakavinye, whom he had been together with for a few years then, wasn't necessary. He said that at that time he was famous but wasn't making the money to match it.

""I was asking that because, you have been cohabiting with this person to an extent that you get to discuss what kind of seats you will want for your wedding, cars, wedding gown and suit. I knew she already knew we were getting married, because we had even decided to tell our parents that,"" Njugush explained.

Why 'Empire' actor's career could crumble

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett could be jailed for three years for lying to the police. The actor had recorded a statement a statement a few weeks ago claiming to have been attacked.

Smollett was on Thursday arrested and charged with lying to police after he claimed to have been attacked and beaten up by two masked men, while they shouted racist and homophobic slurs in Chicago.

The 36-year-old caused an online uproar when he told the police late last month that two ardent supporters of President Donald Trump attacked him, putting a noose around his neck and later poured a bleaching agent on him.

However, after investigations, Smollett's claims in the statement he had recorded with the Chicago Police were found to be untrue.

According to The Guardian, Smollett is said to have handed himself to the police Thursday morning and, later in the day, he was taken to court where he was charged with felony disorderly conduct.

If found guilty, the charge could bring up a three-year prison jail term and Smollett could also be compelled to pay for the cost of the investigations into his report, which the authorities established that he had fabricated the entire scenario.

Size 8: DJ Mo hasn't cheated

Gospel musician Size 8 Reborn has dismissed reports claiming that her husband DJ Mo is a cheat. Sometime last year, rumours within the gospel circles emerged claiming that the singer walked out of their matrimonial home after she found out that he was cheating on her.

The claims were almost made believable when DJ Mo later appeared in an interview and opened up on their marriage up and downs, stating that there was a time his wife disappeared from their home for about a week after an argument. DJ Mo explained that it was a normal disagreement between a couple even though people read a bit more from it.

Recently, in an interview with radio host Masawe Jappani, Mama Wambo, as Size 8 Reborn prefers to be called lately, maintained that her husband of five years has been nothing but faithful to their marriage.

""Those are just rumours and they will always be there. But that doesn't mean our marriage is perfect. We argue like any other couple would, but at the end of the day we sit, talk and see how best to handle the situation at hand,"" she reacted when put to task to explain the cheating claims.

Grand Pa Records CEO Refigah was left counting huge losses after thugs broke into his studio. The Tuesday night break-in happened at Olympic estate, and left the premises wiped clean.

According to Refigah, the studio equipment was valued at Sh1.5 million. The thieves, who must have had a good idea of the premise, broke a humongous steel padlock of the main gate and gained access to the front door of the studio, where they also cut down a set of sophisticated locks without triggering an alarm.

Refigah said he received a call from the producer who was reporting to work as usual on Wednesday morning.

""They stole the mixer, sound card, compressor, three sets of recording microphones, sound systems and two monitors,"" a disgruntled Refigah narrated. They had relocated the studio to Olympic estate four years ago from Kibera Plaza.

""We suspect this could be an inside job because this has never happened since we moved here,"" he added.

Supporting his claims, the former rapper argued that the thieves, hit the premise, just a day the installation of CCTV Cameras in the studio was set to begin. They reported at Kilimani Police Station."

A check for a total of $3,500, written by Jussie Smollett to the two brothers who 'staged his attack', states it was for a 'training fee'.

According to TMZ, the 36-year-old actor wrote a check to Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo on January 23, 2019.

This is six days before Abel and his brother Olabinjo, or 'Ola', reportedly faked a hate crime attack on Smollett in Chicago.

The memo line on the check reads: '5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.'





Sources reportedly told TMZ that Smollett paid $600 a week for a five-week workout plan and $100 a week for a five-week nutrition plan, which equals $3,500.

There was also a Venmo payment from September 2018 of $100 to Abel, reportedly for 'training'.

Allegedly, 'Don't Go' is a reference to a song that Smollett was going to appear in a music video for.

The website reports that Smollett weighed 192 pounds and he needed to lose 20 pounds ahead of the shoot.

Texts between the brothers and Smollett allegedly show them reminding him to do cardio and to stay on his meal plan.

The memo line on the check reads: '5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.' Smolett reportedly wanted brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundair to help him lose 20 pounds

On Wednesday, after three weeks of investigation, Chicago police publicly announced that they believed Smollett made up the attack that he claimed was perpetrated by white men shouting racist and anti-gay slurs.

Details released from the Cook County State's Attorney office show that even the first officers to respond to Smollett's report of an attack on January 29 had reason to be suspicious.

'Chicago Police Officers observed that Smollett had a rope draped around his neck,' Risa Lanier, a Cook County State's Attorney, wrote in the bond proffer.

'This was captured on police body worn camera. Seconds later, Smollett asked police to shut off the cameras,' she continued.

Police responded to Smollett's Streeterville apartment about 45 minutes after the purported attack.

Though Smollett explained that he had left the rope around his neck to 'preserve evidence', the responding officers were privately baffled that he was still wearing the noose somewhat like a necktie, according to sources briefed on the investigation.

Per Chicago Police Department policy, the officers informed Smollett that their body-worn cameras were active, and he requested that they be shut off - another nagging hint that something was off, sources say.

Cops also found it odd when Smollett led them outside his apartment to show them where the alleged attack took place, and immediately pointed out a security camera that he believed had captured the incident.

Smollett also referred to this security camera during his now infamous interview with ABC's Robin Roberts.

'I looked up and I saw there was a camera directly on the light-post that is in the intersection, so I'm like: ""There it is"",' Smollett said.

'And then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north. So they didn't have it, and that was disappointing.'

In this interview with ABC News, Smollett described the camera he though had captured the attack. Police say he pointed out the camera to them immediately

Police now say that Smollett had specifically cased that camera with brothers Abel and Ola, bodybuilders of Nigerian descent whom he is accused of paying to stage the attack.

On January 27, two days before the attack, police say that Smollett picked up the brothers in his car and drove them to the intersection to plan the attack.

'Smollett directed the brothers' attention toward a surveillance camera on the corner, which he believed would capture the incident,' Lanier wrote in the bond proffer.

In his initial report of the attack, Smollett also perplexed investigators by refusing to turn over his cell phone to responding officers, who wanted to verify that he had been on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

The records he ultimately handed over were heavily redacted - which sources say allowed cops to zero in their investigation by focusing on the call records that he had deleted, by comparing them with records obtained through subpoena of his phone carrier.

As the investigation progressed, CPD was very careful in its public statements, continuing to describe Smollett as an 'alleged victim' up until the point that charges were filed.

Though the camera outside of Smollett's apartment was pointed a different direction and did not capture the attack, it and other cameras ultimately unraveled the case.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson (above) expressed outrage at Smollett for allegedly lying to investigators. Police were suspicious of his story from the very start

Smollett eagerly pointed out this camera to police as he described the attack, but didn't realize that it was pointed in the other direction and had not captured the incident

After extensive canvassing, police were able to track the movements of the purported attackers to the point they left and arrived in hired cars, and use taxi and rideshare records to identify them.

The brothers confessed their involvement, and receipts for the purchase of items used in the attack offered damning evidence that the attack was indeed a hoax.

At a press conference on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson expressed outrage at Smollett for allegedly lying to investigators.

'Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?' Johnson said. 'How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?'

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct-false report, a Class 4 felony.

He continues to vigorously maintain his innocence. The producers of the television show Empire have said that he will be cut from the final two episodes of the season.

Smollett is currently free on a $100,000 bond and is next due in court on March 8."

Smollett turned himself into police on Thursday morning on charges of filing a false police report, after investigators concluded he had faked a racist and homophobic hate crime against himself in downtown Chicago last month. Smollett continues to deny any wrongdoing.

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you ♥️,” Terrence Howard said on Instagram, in a post accompanied by a video of Smollett cradling a baby on board a private jet.

Yet Howard’s comment was not well received by some of his followers, with one writing: “Seriously? You support that lying felon? Still? Even though all the facts are out? If it was a white person staging a black person, would you still support him?! Typical liberal hypocrites. Just lost [all] respect.”

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” Howard responded.”The Jussie that I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.”

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone that I’ve called my son for 5 years,” Howard continued. “It’s God’s job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There’s nothing more harmful than a fake friend! Real talk.”

Howard is not the only Empire star to protest Smollett’s innocence, despite mounting evidence that he staged the attack with the help of two men after becoming dissatisfied with his $1 million-plus acting salary. This week, his co-star Gabby Sidibe also backed Smollett’s claims of innocence, while attacking the media for questioning his story.

“I know him, I believe him, I stand with him. #jussiesmollett,” Sidibe wrote on Instagram, accompanied by a quote from black nationalist leader Malcolm X about how the media twists the narrative against African-Americans. She later deleted the post.

According to TMZ, Smollett returned to the set of Empire on Thursday, where he swore to the cast he was not guilty of the alleged charges.

”I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family,” he reportedly said. “I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are all coupled up as they attend Charles Finch and Chanel’s 11th Annual Pre-Oscar Awards Dinner.

The newlyweds arrived at Polo Lounge at The Beverly Hills Hotel on Saturday and we couldn’t help but notice how loved-up they look.

The pair, who surprised us all with their December wedding last year, stepped out in their fashionable wear – because, why not? – and turned heads with Miley wearing a multicoloured two-piece woollen number from the iconic French fashion house Chanel.

Not one to upstage the love of his life, Liam opted for an all-black ensemble but made it fashion.

We see you, Liam. We see you.

This comes not long after Miley said that losing their home put things in perspective for their pair and they decided to push forward their wedding plans.

The couple were left ‘devastated’ when the fires hit Malibu in November and took over their home.

While she and Liam, and their pets, managed to escape unharmed, Miley confirmed that their home ‘no longer stands’ and both she and Liam had shared photos of the wreckage on social media.

Speaking to Vanity Fair, the Wrecking Ball singer said: ‘I’m not sure without losing Malibu we would’ve been ready to take this step or ever even gotten married, who can say?

‘The timing felt right and I go with my heart. No one is promised the next day, or the next, so I try to be in the now as much as possible.’

She said she was still ‘reeling’ over losing personal items in the fire, but she is ‘grateful’ for the memories her home brought her and has made her feel ‘more connected to being human’.

Miley explained: ‘I would say that losing the house changed us much more than getting married changed us. When you experience what we experienced together with someone, it’s like glue.

‘You’re the only two people in the world who can understand.’

Miley claims the fire changed herself and Liam (Picture: Rex)

Miley and Liam shocked fans by confirming they had married in a secret wedding, held at their Tennessee home in December, by sharing photos of their big day to social media.

Both have since been gushing about married life and Liam pulled on our heartstrings when he confessed to tearing up over Miley wanting to take his last name.

Miley, meanwhile, has said she is ‘redefining love’ and argued her marriage to Liam is part of a ‘new age’ because she is a ‘queer woman in a heterosexual marriage’.

‘We’re redefining, to be fucking frank, what it looks like for someone that’s a queer person like myself to be in a hetero relationship,’ she told the publication.

‘A big part of my pride and my identity is being a queer person. What I preach is: People fall in love with people, not gender, not looks, not whatever. What I’m in love with exists on almost a spiritual level. It has nothing to do with sexuality.’

According to the New York Post, Jeffrey Underwood and Amanda Davila allege Isabel and Gregory Dawson, “conspired to, by hook and by crook, covertly acquire” their flat.

“The Dawsons have engaged in similar conduct over many years, ultimately manipulating the City of New York … and taking for themselves property and rights that the city and organizations have attempted to and intended to provide for others,” legal papers claim.

OTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Jussie Smollett UPdate: Case Headed to Grand Jury: Report

Per the New York Post:

The East 13th Street squatter’s apartment building has become a battleground between the Dawson clan and other residents who accuse the family of bullying their way into taking over more units.

Rosario Dawson moved into the dilapidated and abandoned building with her family in 1986. The family came and went over the years, relocating for a time to Texas. They held onto their fourth-floor apartment and managed to expand their holdings.

Isabel Dawson’s brother, Nicky Scott, moved into one unit and Rex Hughes, a family friend, installed himself in the basement.

Residents said Isabel Dawson, then living in a first-floor unit, jackhammered a hole in the floor in 2013, and installed a spiral staircase to create a duplex.

For some, it was a Dawson reign of terror.

“Isabel Dawson’s threatening and violent behavior have jeopardized the safety of the residents,” Alfa Diallo, then presidents of the Tenants’ Association, wrote in a 2001 letter as part of an effort to stop violence by the Dawsons.

The Underwoods claim they were forced to move out when the building was renovated in 2015.

The Dawsons allegedly promised that they could buy their flat at a discounted rate of $2,500 after the renovations were complete, but didn’t follow through. Now they are accused of trying to maintain control of the building meant for low-income families.

The lawsuit states: ‘The Dawsons have engaged in similar conduct over many years, ultimately manipulating the City of New York … and taking for themselves property and rights that the city and organizations have attempted to and intended to provide for others.’

The suit is seeking at least $250,000 in damages along with an apartment in the now-renovated building.

Oh, and the Trump administration did something genuinely good in announcing a campaign to fight anti-LGBTQ laws around the world, even if the president doesn't actually seem to know such a thing exists. Oh, and Eminem is upset about the end of The Punisher, because that's a thing, too. What is even happening?

Well, That's One Way to Stop Trump's Wall

What Happened: What does it take to unite the country? Based on the number of states coming together to push back on President Trump's plan for border wall funding, the answer might be ""the declaration of a national emergency."" Go figure.

What Really Happened: A little over a week ago, just as President Trump was signing a spending bill that would keep the government open, he declared a national emergency to fund his border wall. The Presidential Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency takes around $3.6 billion in funds earmarked for military construction—as well as $600 million in asset forfeiture funds and around $2.5 billion drawn from Department of Defense funds aimed at drug interdiction—and adds it to the $1.375 billion Congress had included in the actual spending bill to build a wall along the US southern border wall almost all experts agree won't actually work.

During the speech announcing the national emergency, Trump not only admitted he didn't need to do it, but he predicted legal challenges to the declaration itself. Last week, those challenges got underway, with one lawsuit in particular catching a lot of people's attention.

As if the idea of the state of California suing the president wasn't eye-catching enough, it turned out that it wasn't just California, in case the screenshot attached to that tweet didn't make it clear enough. Lots of states were jumping on board this particular bandwagon.

Yes, 16 states are coming together to sue the president over this issue. Aside from the fact that, again, Trump said in his announcement ""I don't need to do this,"" what else could the legal teams use to argue their case that this national emergency is anything but a national emergency?

Admittedly, that's a pretty good case. The president responded as you might expect, where you might expect.

Still, at least the people are on Trump's side. Actually, never mind.

The Takeaway: And the hits keep coming, with a further lawsuit being announced by the county of El Paso, Texas even as of this writing. Remember the days when then-candidate Trump talked about so much winning? Who knew he was thinking about the number of lawsuits headed his way…

Double Standards

What Happened: A white nationalist was arrested and detained before he had the chance to carry out an alleged plan to kill several prominent Democrats and journalists. President Trump, meanwhile, seemed unavailable for comment on the matter."

Terrence Howard has broken his silence following the arrest of his embattled “Empire” co-star Jussie Smollett, telling fans “the Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious.”

Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on the hip-hop drama, voiced his support for his on-screen son in an Instagram post on Saturday.

“All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you,” Howard captioned a video showing the 36-year-old actor playing with Howard’s young son, Hero.

Howard also fiercely defended Smollett against fans who were critical of his support.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he wrote in a reply to one fan. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide.

“Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Smollett, who plays Lyon’s middle son Jamal on the hit Fox series, was arrested last week on charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly staging his own hate attack in Chicago.

He claimed a pair of attackers doused him in bleach, tossed a noose around his neck while yelling, “f—-t,” “n—–r” and “This is MAGA country!” at him on Jan. 29.

Smollett’s other co-stars, including his on-screen mom Taraji P. Henson, who plays Cookie Lyon, have been silent in wake of his arrest.

On Friday, Fox announced it was nixing Jamal Lyon’s character from the final two episodes of season 5, which is set to resume in March."

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) If you thought this past week's news cycle -- dominated by President Donald Trump's ""Saturday Night Live"" Twitter rant, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe's media blitz and court appearances by Jussie Smollett and Roger Stone -- was a whirlwind, just wait for this coming week.

You will be able to thank Oscar, Bernie, Don, Kim and Michael, for starters.

Sunday, the Oscars may finally give Britain a chance to celebrate -- that is, if Olivia Colman, nominated for best actress for her role as Queen Anne in ""The Favourite,"" takes home the gold-plated statue. wrote that ""here in Britain, we'll be cheering like mad for a national treasure. Come on Hollywood, take pity on our Brexit-plagued island, and give us this win."" Of course, that would mean beating out Glenn Close, currently favored by many to win for her role in ""The Wife.""

But just as soon as the Oscars come to a close, we will be jostled back to the world of American presidential politics. On Monday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the latest candidate to declare his 2020 presidential bid, participates in a CNN town hall. And CNN political analyst believed Democrats could benefit from taking note as to what has made Sanders so appealing -- beginning with the mandate to ""build a movement, not a campaign.""

While Trump wished Sanders well as a fellow rival of Hillary Clinton's in his 2016 run, it's unlikely the President will have too much time to focus on the Democratic candidates this week, as he heads to Vietnam for a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

David Reynolds, Professor of International History at Cambridge University, John Kirby that there are pros and cons to hosting summits. ""Yes, political leaders can cut through the red tape and the roadblocks imposed by lower-level bureaucrats. But they can also overreach themselves by making promises that experts would consider ill-informed and misguided,"" said Reynolds. And given Trump's propensity for going off script, it'd be wise to keep expectations low. , Professor of International History at Cambridge University, said in an exchange with CNN military and diplomatic analystthat there are pros and cons to hosting summits. ""Yes, political leaders can cut through the red tape and the roadblocks imposed by lower-level bureaucrats. But they can also overreach themselves by making promises that experts would consider ill-informed and misguided,"" said Reynolds. And given Trump's propensity for going off script, it'd be wise to keep expectations low.

The plot thickens

Elie Honig in his weekly column, if the latest New York Times reporting, alleging that Trump may have tried to influence which Southern District of New York prosecutor oversaw the Michael Cohen probe, proves true, Trump legal woes may grow. As a former prosecutor, Honig added, ""I've charged and tried obstruction of justice cases. If this isn't an attempt to obstruct, then I don't know what is."" Though Trump may be thousands of miles away, his legal challenges at home continue to mount. CNN legal analyst wrote in his weekly column, if the latest New York Times reporting, alleging that Trump may have tried to influence which Southern District of New York prosecutor oversaw the Michael Cohen probe, proves true, Trump legal woes may grow. As a former prosecutor, Honig added, ""I've charged and tried obstruction of justice cases. If this isn't an attempt to obstruct, then I don't know what is.""

Of course, this isn't the first Trump legal story to set off an alarm in Washington. McCabe, in a ""60 Minutes"" interview this week, said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein broached the idea of recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey. (Rosenstein has denied making such a suggestion.)

Paul Sracic, a professor at Youngstown State University, , a professor at Youngstown State University, was baffled by the admission that two top government officials could potentially ""think for even a moment that invoking the 25th Amendment was a plausible way"" to remove Trump -- especially since the process must be initiated by Vice President Mike Pence (who appears to remain a fierce Trump loyalist). And Trump himself weighed in on Twitter, accusing both McCabe and Rosenstein of treasonous activity.

The challenges to Trump's presidency could only get worse this week when Michael Cohen testifies publicly before Congress on Wednesday.

Josh Campbell While has said he isn't in the business of making predictions, he thinks Mueller will ultimately ""not move against the President"" and instead uphold existing Department of Justice protocol to not indict a sitting president. Campbell cautioned that just because Mueller doesn't bring a case against Trump, doesn't mean he won't lay out ""a compelling case for looking upon many of Trump's actions as highly questionable.""

Neal Katyal, acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama, And, acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama, added in The New York Times that if the report is ""anything less than a full clearing of the president: Congress would be under a constitutional obligation to investigate the facts for itself.""

Trying on new 2020 candidates just for fit

Jill Filipovic, a progressive Democrat, Sanders isn't the only Democratic candidate making waves. This week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota participated in a CNN town hall in New Hampshire, carving out a space for herself as a moderate and pragmatic Democrat. As, a progressive Democrat, noted , Klobuchar is a worthy foe for those on the left. ""If she's defeated from the left -- and I believe she will be -- it will be the confirmation and the mandate for true progress so many of us have been waiting for.""

Julian Zelizer had anything to say about it, the answer would be a definitive no. He Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl around whether former Vice President Joe Biden will declare his candidacy soon. Ifhad anything to say about it, the answer would be a definitive no. He argued that with such a diverse array of candidates already in the mix, Biden would do little to move the Democrats forward.

Karen Tumulty, a Washington Post columnist, Diversity isn't the only driving factor in the primaries., a Washington Post columnist, wrote that the conversation around socialist and progressive ideals will play a critical role in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. That said, she cautioned that many of these proposals -- from the Green New Deal to Medicare For All -- are light on details, a sign that ""the presidential contenders are not sweating the policy details because they understand that Democratic primary voters aren't, either.""

Is it 2019 -- or 1919?

Ashley M. Jones It's 2019, and one Alabama editor and publisher -- Howard ""Goodloe"" Sutton -- thought the Ku Klux Klan should ride again. While many dismissed Sutton as a fringe figure, warned us that this wasn't just Alabama's problem: ""He is part of an American problem which has festered and bubbled since before 1776."" In other words, Sutton clings to bigoted ideas that many of America's Founding Fathers did when they drafted the Constitution.

But Jones went one step further and said Sutton shouldn't be ""written off as just a man using free speech."" After all, his words are inciting violence against innocent Americans of color, and ""how many black people have been free-speeched to death?""

Kyle Whitmire AL.com's shared Jones' fear and frustration, though perhaps for slightly more personal reasons. Whitmire once worked for Sutton, and this editorial has called into question everything he thought he knew about his former boss.

Sutton could have made significant contributions to ""Alabama's Black Belt, long poisoned by poverty and racial oppression."" But instead, Whitmire wrote, ""he let himself be eaten from the inside by hatred.""

The Jussie Smollett case

LZ Granderson. The hardest question is the what -- ""as in what do we do next?"" Sometimes racists aren't the only hurdle in battling bigotry. This week, Chicago police charged ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for falsely claiming he was attacked by two men in MAGA hats in January. Though his attorneys have promised an ""aggressive defense,"" the story raises a variety of uncomfortable questions, wrote . The hardest question is the what -- ""as in what do we do next?""

Jonathan Greenblatt And, as the Anti-Defamation League's wrote , it's critical we not lose sight of the fact that for every Smollett case, there are thousands of other indisputable hate crimes that ""leave a lasting impact on the targeted victims and their communities."" In fact, he notes, hate crimes are on the rise -- and we cannot let one case impact the many victims who may ""seek justice in the future.""

Bill Hinkle about a homophobic attack he and his then-boyfriend endured in Los Angeles. ""I've never considered myself a victim, although I guess I technically am,"" reflected Hinkle, who said ""every possible scenario"" explaining Smollett's behavior ""saddens me""; ""this event will be with him for the rest of his life, just like the scar on my chin will be with me."" Violence like this leaves scars, as reflected about a homophobic attack he and his then-boyfriend endured in Los Angeles. ""I've never considered myself a victim, although I guess I technically am,"" reflected Hinkle, who said ""every possible scenario"" explaining Smollett's behavior ""saddens me""; ""this event will be with him for the rest of his life, just like the scar on my chin will be with me.""

Misogyny on the runway and at City Hall

Hilary George-Parkin wrote we should not gloss over the parts of his life and legacy that we do not like. ""His opinions of women's bodies were damaging, archaic and often misogynistic,"" After the death of Karl Lagerfeld, a beloved and prolific designer,wrote we should not gloss over the parts of his life and legacy that we do not like. ""His opinions of women's bodies were damaging, archaic and often misogynistic,"" she said . And as the fashion industry tries to make strides toward embracing a variety of shapes and sizes, it's important to acknowledge that ""there is still a long way to go"" in countering the pernicious tropes about beauty that Lagerfeld helped to normalize.

Christine Quinn But fashion isn't the only industry plagued by misogyny. argued that the political sphere is just as bad. When she ran for New York mayor in 2013, she ""made sure that everything from my hair to my clothes made me seem more 'likable,' approachable and classically feminine."" The result? Voters thought she was inauthentic, and she lost. Six years later, and with a number of female politicians entering the presidential race, she warned that the ""same destructive dynamics"" are at play.

A very personal take on vaccinations

Elsa Sjunneson-Henry she is living proof of what happens when people do not take childhood vaccination seriously. Her mother was exposed to German measles while she was pregnant, a result of herd immunity failure. And Sjunneson-Henry was born with From celebrities to politicians' wives to President Trump himself , it seems almost anyone is willing to question the science behind vaccines. But wrote she is living proof of what happens when people do not take childhood vaccination seriously. Her mother was exposed to German measles while she was pregnant, a result of herd immunity failure. And Sjunneson-Henry was born with Congenital Rubella Syndrome , which has resulted in cataracts, a heart defect, hearing loss and countless surgeries.

Though she is healthy today, Sjunneson-Henry is using her platform to advocate for childhood vaccination and against the false and dangerous claims that vaccines cause autism. As she wrote, she hopes ""we remember that we came close to killing measles once, and we can do it for good if we work together to strengthen the herd.""

And I hope authorities in Chicago throw the book at him because the lies he is accused of telling will likely bring great harm to innocent victims.



Smollett's arrest Thursday for allegedly filing a false police report came as no surprise. His improbable tale -- he said he was accosted last month by two men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs, beat him up, put a noose around his neck and doused him with bleach, with one of the men saying that ""this is MAGA [Make America Great Again] country"" -- sounded like a page from the first draft of a rejected screenplay.

Real life doesn't happen that way. Actual white supremacists and homophobes don't stroll through the streets of Chicago on a bitterly cold night, carrying a hate-crimes kit of rope and Clorox, hoping to chance upon someone who is black, gay and modestly famous. They don't hurl perfectly scripted insults. They don't vanish without a trace.

The minute I heard Smollett's story, I suspected it would eventually fall apart - and I feared the potential consequences for genuine victims of genuine hate crimes.

Smollett was arrested just one day after federal authorities released evidence of the kind of grave threat that really does exist. They announced the arrest of Christopher Hasson, a 49-year-old U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist, for allegedly amassing a deadly arsenal in his Silver Spring, Maryland, home and planning to assassinate a list of public officials and journalists, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.

The menace of such white-supremacist terrorism is real and growing. Debacles such as Smollett's apparent hoax do nothing but provide excuses to ignore the threat.

Were the news media too credulous in their initial reporting about Smollett's claim? Not necessarily. A well-known person reported being assaulted, and Chicago police said they were taking his story seriously. Smollett had suffered some minor injuries and been treated at a hospital. I don't know what reporters were supposed to do except report the facts as far as they were known - absent concrete evidence that those facts were actually fabrications.

Police now say that the scratches on Smollett's face were self-inflicted and that he paid two men $3,500 to rough him up - gently - so he could become more famous and demand more money for his role in the Fox television series ""Empire."" But nobody knew that at first. When new facts gradually emerged that cast doubt on Smollett's account, those facts were reported.

I also don't blame the fellow ""Empire"" cast members who stood by Smollett. It is only natural to want to support a friend and colleague who is in crisis.

But politicians who rushed to use Smollett's account as a shocking sign of the times -- Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., both called it an ""attempted modern-day lynching,"" for example -- were foolish to do so. The story was shaky from the beginning, and a little early caution would have made unnecessary a lot of eventual backpedaling.

Was there, in general, an eagerness to believe Smollett because of the atmosphere President Trump has created? Probably -- and, I would argue, quite understandably.

According to the FBI, there were 7,175 hate-crime incidents in this country in 2017 - a big jump from 2016, when there were 6,121 such incidents. (Those figures surely minimize the real problem, since many jurisdictions do not report hate crimes to the FBI at all.) Regarding incidents in 2017 in which victims were targeted because of race, 2,013 attacks were against African-Americans versus 741 against whites. Of incidents in which victims were targeted because of religion, the vast majority were against Jews and Muslims. There were more than a thousand anti-LGBT incidents versus just 32 classified as anti-heterosexual.

No, Trump isn't telling people to go out and commit hate crimes. But the white-supremacist lunatic who killed 11 innocent Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue last October was apparently motivated, somehow, by Trump's apocalyptic rhetoric about illegal immigration. It's not hard to see why, to some, Smollett's story might have seemed plausible.

Trump didn't actually put words in Smollett's mouth, though. The actor allegedly made the decision to lie and should now face the consequences.

Police officials in Chicago, where the murder rate is out of control, had to waste time and resources on a wild goose chase. Even worse, the next victim of an actual hate crime might not be believed. By allegedly feigning injury to himself, Smollett grievously injured untold others.

The drama involving coast-based musician Akothee’s raunchy performance during a recent show in Watamu, has boiled down to Kenya Film and Classification Board boss Dr Ezekiel Mutua taking drastic measures in a bid to curb over sexualised content.

In a statement, Mutua said the board had received complaints from the members of the public on the current wave of over-sexualised content and stage performances in public places.

He went on to note that the board has examined numerous artistes and performers and found that some of their performances are offensive, unpalatable, inappropriate, and contravene the law.

“The board is disturbed at the extent to which some famous artistes are going to, to attract audiences and relevance, by exposing their private parts in public, gyrating in obscene ways and failure to uphold common decency in their public performances,” noted Mutua.

As such, going forward, Mutua said KFCB will be forced to work with relevant authorities to ensure such shows are regulated and, if need be, the board will not hesitate to ban them.

Njugush didn't propose to his wife

Comedian Njugush has revealed that he wedded his wife Celestine Ndunda aka ‘Wakavinye’ without proposing to her.

Njugush, who has scaled the ranks of fame, and along the journey stayed on course with his only sweetheart who stood by him, explained why he never got to propose. In an up-close television interview, Wakavinye recalled Njugush’s weird proposal to her.

“He asked me whether we could have our wedding on December or August; that was his proposal,” she said.

Njugush went on to explain why he felt proposing to Wakavinye, whom he had been together with for a few years then, wasn’t necessary. He said that at that time he was famous but wasn’t making the money to match it.

“I was asking that because, you have been cohabiting with this person to an extent that you get to discuss what kind of seats you will want for your wedding, cars, wedding gown and suit. I knew she already knew we were getting married, because we had even decided to tell our parents that,” Njugush explained.

Why ‘Empire’ actor’s career could crumble

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett could be jailed for three years for lying to the police. The actor had recorded a statement a statement a few weeks ago claiming to have been attacked.

Smollett was on Thursday arrested and charged with lying to police after he claimed to have been attacked and beaten up by two masked men, while they shouted racist and homophobic slurs in Chicago.

The 36-year-old caused an online uproar when he told the police late last month that two ardent supporters of President Donald Trump attacked him, putting a noose around his neck and later poured a bleaching agent on him.

However, after investigations, Smollett’s claims in the statement he had recorded with the Chicago Police were found to be untrue.

According to The Guardian, Smollett is said to have handed himself to the police Thursday morning and, later in the day, he was taken to court where he was charged with felony disorderly conduct.

If found guilty, the charge could bring up a three-year prison jail term and Smollett could also be compelled to pay for the cost of the investigations into his report, which the authorities established that he had fabricated the entire scenario.

Size 8: DJ Mo hasn't cheated

Gospel musician Size 8 Reborn has dismissed reports claiming that her husband DJ Mo is a cheat. Sometime last year, rumours within the gospel circles emerged claiming that the singer walked out of their matrimonial home after she found out that he was cheating on her.

The claims were almost made believable when DJ Mo later appeared in an interview and opened up on their marriage up and downs, stating that there was a time his wife disappeared from their home for about a week after an argument. DJ Mo explained that it was a normal disagreement between a couple even though people read a bit more from it.

Recently, in an interview with radio host Masawe Jappani, Mama Wambo, as Size 8 Reborn prefers to be called lately, maintained that her husband of five years has been nothing but faithful to their marriage.

""Those are just rumours and they will always be there. But that doesn’t mean our marriage is perfect. We argue like any other couple would, but at the end of the day we sit, talk and see how best to handle the situation at hand,” she reacted when put to task to explain the cheating claims.

Grand theft at Grand Pa

Grand Pa Records CEO Refigah was left counting huge losses after thugs broke into his studio. The Tuesday night break-in happened at Olympic estate, and left the premises wiped clean.

According to Refigah, the studio equipment was valued at Sh1.5 million. The thieves, who must have had a good idea of the premise, broke a humongous steel padlock of the main gate and gained access to the front door of the studio, where they also cut down a set of sophisticated locks without triggering an alarm.

Refigah said he received a call from the producer who was reporting to work as usual on Wednesday morning.

“They stole the mixer, sound card, compressor, three sets of recording microphones, sound systems and two monitors,” a disgruntled Refigah narrated. They had relocated the studio to Olympic estate four years ago from Kibera Plaza.

“We suspect this could be an inside job because this has never happened since we moved here,” he added.

Supporting his claims, the former rapper argued that the thieves, hit the premise, just a day the installation of CCTV Cameras in the studio was set to begin. They reported at Kilimani Police Station."

Eddie Johnson declared last Thursday to a crowded room of reporters at police headquarters.

As much attention as Jussie Smollett, a delusional and craven TV actor who, police say, staged a hate crime for money and glory.

Johnson was there to detail how police exposed the lies behind the hate crime claim by Smollett, a cast member of the Fox TV show “Empire.”

Johnson is an eloquent and compassionate crime-fighter who is trying hard to reform his troubled police department.

OPINION

But I wish he had taken that podium to announce his detectives were tracking down more of the murderers and thugs who terrorize our city daily. And answer the questions asked by hundreds of families: Why can’t the Chicago Police Department solve the brutal crimes against our loved ones? What about us?

The three-week Smollett reality show has taken yet another bizarre turn, as Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.

Police officials detailed a massive investigative effort: How they viewed reams of video footage and methodically built a timeline of the alleged attack. How detectives canvassed the Streeterville neighborhood and interviewed more than 100 people.

How they identified the two “assailants,” brothers who took a taxi away from the scene. How they tracked them to O’Hare Airport, where they boarded a flight to Nigeria.

“While we were waiting for their return, we executed over 50 search warrants and subpoenaed phone records, social media records and records on people to help us illuminate the likely facts that occurred in this event,” Area Central Detectives Cmdr. Edward Wodnicki was quoted as saying.

When the brothers returned from Nigeria, police interrogated and held them for two days, and got them to admit that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack.

Twelve detectives worked on the case.

“When we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off — you know, because we have to invest valuable resources,” Johnson said at the press conference.

Indeed. Murder and pillage at will, but if you are a famous celebrity and “piss off” the police, they will hunt you down.

The Smollett investigation was “old-fashioned police work,” Johnson said. “We didn’t pull any resources from any shooting or homicide investigations.” The case got no “special attention.”

Of course not.

Even if that’s true, it begs the question: Where is that magnificent, old-fashioned police work on behalf of the hundreds of murders and shootings that leave families begging for justice on the South and West sides of Chicago?

In 2017, police solved 114 of the 650 murders that year, a 17.5 percent clearance rate, according to a Chicago Sun-Times analysis of police data.

Police cleared only 5 percent of non-fatal shootings in 2016, shows research by the University of Chicago Crime Lab.

“I haven’t heard from the Chicago Police Department, anyone, in nine years,” Sheila Rush said last Friday in an interview on WGCI-FM. “Nothing.”

In 2010, her son, Damian Turner, 18, was killed in a drive-by shooting on Chicago’s South Side. The case was never solved.

“You would think they would want to reach out (and say), ‘Ms. Rush, is there anything we can do for you? We’re sorry about your loss.’”

“You don’t have any money, you are not a star, you don’t get attention.”

In the Smollett case, no one was murdered. No one was shot.

Rush and too many other grieving families ask: “What about us?”

From Hollywood stars condemning President Trump Donald John TrumpSouth Korea slams Bolton book as 'distorting the reality' of nuclear talks Democrats face tough questions with Bolton Protesters try to bring down statue of Andrew Jackson near White House MORE to potential surprise Oscars cameos, the spotlight at Sunday’s 91st annual Academy Awards is likely to shine on politics more than once.

Here are five political moments to be on the look-out for on Hollywood’s biggest night.

A Trump bashing bonanza?

Hollywood award shows have been criticized for taking an increasingly political tone in recent years. Cue Robert de Niro declaring ""F--k Trump"" at last year’s Tony Awards, or Meryl Streep slamming the then-president-elect as a ""bully"" at the 2017 Golden Globes.

While explicitly anti-Trump rhetoric mostly took a back seat at last year’s Jimmy Kimmel-hosted Oscars, it could be back in full force this year during the show beginning at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Multiple-category nominee “Vice” presents a deeply unflattering portrait of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and its cast and crew have used the subject matter to criticize today’s Republican Party as well.

If A-listers do take a swipe at the controversial commander in chief, who will be the first entertainer to break the Trump seal and mention him by name?

Surprise cameos

With no host — comedian Kevin Hart stepped down from the gig after homophobic tweets he wrote resurfaced last year — this year’s ceremony could be in for some surprises.

Michelle Obama Michelle LeVaughn Robinson ObamaMichelle Obama on Juneteenth: 'Work and service and protest has led us forward' The Hill's Morning Report - Treasury, Fed urge more spending, lending to ease COVID-19 wreckage Budowsky: Michelle Obama or Tammy Duckworth for VP MORE made an unannounced appearance to kick off the Grammy Awards earlier this month, and the former first lady also famously announced the winner of the “Best Picture” category at the 2013 Oscars.

Without a headliner at the helm of the broadcast, the pressure on producers could be on to secure a big-name star of Hollywood — or politics — to shake things up.

Immigration a hot topic?

Lupita Nyong'o and Kumail Nanjiani made an impassioned plea while presenting at last year’s Oscars for members of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. “To all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you,” Nanjiani told viewers.

The focus at this year’s ceremony may again turn to immigration, particularly if director Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” picks up an Academy Award.

Jorge Antonio Guerrero, a Mexican actor who stars in the Oscar-nominated film, reportedly obtained a last-minute U.S. visa to attend the awards show. Guerrero said in January that he had been denied entry into the country three times in the last year. According to reports, Netflix, “Roma’s” distributor, helped secure a non-immigrant visa for Guerrero by working with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

The film, which chronicles the life of a Mexico City family’s maid, could also draw focus onto domestic employees and conditions for the working class.

#MeToo, part two

Time isn't up for awards shows to promote anti-sexual harassment initiatives.

During last year's ceremony, the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements were front and center, with the Academy dedicating an entire segment to highlighting Hollywood's women ""trailblazers.""

The mission, advocates say, is far from over.

With “Bohemian Rhapsody” director Bryan Singer facing allegations that that he abused underage boys, and other prominent entertainment industry figures such as singer R. Kelly — who was charged Friday with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse — in the news, Hollywood could very well feel compelled to address the culture and challenges it faces going forward.

Smollett under scrutiny

With the arrest of Jussie Smollett dominating the headlines and becoming the talk of Tinseltown and beyond, there’s a chance that some of the night’s presenters could bring up — or even joke about — the “Empire” star at the Oscars.

Plenty of performers and politicians — from Trump and Sens. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerRomanoff touts endorsements ahead of primary against Hickenlooper Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines The Hill's Campaign Report: Candidates, lawmakers mark Juneteenth MORE (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Fallout from Trump's weekend rally The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - After rough week, can Trump bounce back? Harris's path on police reform littered with land mines MORE (D-Calif.), to Patton Oswalt and Andy Cohen — have weighed in on Smollett, who’s facing a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly filing a false police report after claiming to have been the victim of a hate crime.

For Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who slammed Smollett at a news conference for reportedly orchestrating a “publicity stunt” to boost his “Empire” salary, a platform as big as the Oscars to address the controversy might be welcomed.

“I only hope the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did,” Johnson said on Thursday at a press conference announcing the charges.

Race and racial violence are the subjects of multiple Oscar nominees this year, including “Green Book” and Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” potentially offering winners an opening to discuss hate crimes, be they real or potentially fraudulent."

“The blue parts of America are having a big prosperity party, while that big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail — and they still use the mail,” he continued.

Maher also weighed in on the Jussie Smollett scandal rocking the United States. Smollett was arrested and charged after he was accused of staging a hate crime last month in Chicago. Maher tried to explain Smollett's actions by saying that in America, “there’s nothing more powerful than being a victim.”

“I feel like we’ve gone from this place where I hear people say, ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed,” Maher said. “Take you seriously – that’s a big difference, but we seem to have skipped that step because we always do.”"

Whoever said there is no such thing as bad publicity never met Jussie Smollett.

Ask your HR director. There must be easier ways to get a salary bump.

In a dizzying turn of events, the star went from alleged victim to criminal defendant. The actor has now been arrested in Chicago and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

If convicted, the actor could get one to three years in prison and face a $25,000 fine. And a story that could have helped shine a light on a rash of anti-LGBTQ violence in America will instead give those who are uncomfortable with the topic an excuse to stay in the dark.

I don’t see how we avoid it. There are too many stories. For instance, in a case that didn’t get a fraction of the attention given to the Smollett story, a gay couple was attacked and seriously injured by four men in Austin, Texas, on Jan. 19 in an apparent hate crime. According to the police report, Spencer Deehring and Tristan Perry were beaten and kicked until unconscious.

If Smollett did indeed stage this attack on himself, then the actor did incalculable harm to victims of genuine hate crimes, and shame on him. But if anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable discussing LGBTQ issues is using this case as an easy out, then shame on them.

Let’s catch up. Smollett, a gay African-American actor who stars in the Fox drama “Empire,” claimed that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago on Jan 29. He said that two men who recognized him from the show cornered him in the middle of the night. He said they yelled slurs, hit him, doused him with bleach, and put a noose around his neck — all while shouting, “This is MAGA country!”

A couple weeks later, police questioned two brothers from Nigeria, who told them that Smollett had hired them — at the bargain price of $3,500 — to stage the attack.

The stunt might have been phony, but the hatred it unleashed was real. A lot of it came from anti-Trump’ers — some of whom are running for president. In fact, @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris both tweeted that this was an “attempted modern-day lynching.”

Meanwhile, as this drama was unfolding, the audience got into the act — and tripped over its own feet. Many of those who tried to follow each bounce of this story immediately jumped to conclusions based on nothing more than their biases.

It happened on both the oversensitive left, and the desensitized right. Liberals went off half-cocked and suggested the alleged incident was fueled by the same mood that helped elect Donald Trump. Conservatives cynically used the alleged hoax as an excuse to bash “identity politics.”

If we wanted something to be true, it was true. If we wanted it to be false, it must be false. Why? Because this story wasn’t about Smollett. It was about us — about how we feel about anti-LGBTQ violence.

C’mon people, how broken are we? We’ve gone from not listening to not thinking. We see a tweet or hear a rumor, and we decide — on the spot — whether or not it’s true based on our politics and our prejudices. Case closed.

Last month, when my brother — who happens to be gay, so his antennae are up for stories like this - texted me to share news of the alleged hate crime, I didn’t buy it. The journalist in me was skeptical that white racist homophobes who voted for Trump but also watched “Empire” were roaming the streets of a Democratic haven like Chicago.

But people kept talking about the story. So eventually, I mentioned the alleged attack in a column about how it is that so many LGBTQ stories are in the news these days. And I was careful to use the word “alleged.”

No matter. I still heard from readers who were eager to discount the whole column. Days before police arrested Smollett, they had already made up their minds that the alleged attack was a hoax. Like I said, we feel. We don’t think.

Never mind Jussie Smollett. The justice system will take care of him.

Who’s going to take care of fixing the rest of us?

Letter to the editor:

Those who are racist and bigoted will simply have a field day if it’s confirmed that Jussie Smollett’s attack was faked. But my only question to Smollett would be: Why and what were you thinking?

I’m sure his insurance company, his employer, his fans, his family and his friends would also have questions that he would be hard-pressed to answer. The loss of integrity is permanent and irreversible. I feel sorry for all the players in this story and for what could end up being a senseless waste of resources by our law enforcement personnel and health care providers in Chicago. Those who cry wolf could also profoundly impact the willingness of law enforcement to respond on future hate crimes.

Talker:Angry about Jussie Smollett? Here's what you can do

Finally, all of this dishonors the memories of those who have fallen victim to hate crimes in the past, and exponentially increases the risk that others will suffer the same fate in the future.

Green New Deal: Profoundly Conservative

Letter to the editor:

Like Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, the Green New Deal — which seeks jobs for all Americans in the course of attacking climate change— isn’t radical or socialist. It’s actually conservative.

Roosevelt mobilized our government to combat a depression at home and fascism around the world. Today’s Democrats would mobilize it to address a silent depression and save the planet from ecological catastrophe.

Related:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is a radical front for nationalizing our economy

The Green New Deal aims toward family-supporting jobs, with health care and retirement security. That would be a huge step toward ending our silent depression. And the jobs goal fits perfectly with achieving a sustainable economic future. Creating a green economy is a huge task: there will be much work to do. All this requires costly investments. But inaction is much more costly. Continued inaction ensures more people will lose faith in capitalism — and risks Earth’s ability to sustain human life.

A misdiagnosis isn't the case for majority

Letter to the editor:

All of us can agree that Walt Heyer’s story, published in USA TODAY, is terribly sad. He had a traumatic and abusive childhood, eventually contributing to a misdiagnosis and difficult adult life. But we can’t extrapolate his experience to disregard and fail to support an entire community of people.

I’m a transgender man, and I have worked on transgender issues for nearly 20 years. I’ve met hundreds of transgender people, and I’ve met even more families and friends of transgender people who want to do the right thing for their loved ones. The overwhelming majority of transgender people live happier, healthier, more fulfilling, and thriving lives when they can safely discover, articulate and be their authentic selves. That’s why the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and virtually all of America’s leading medical organizations affirm and support transgender people.

Related:As a transgender woman, I can't fight Trump's policies by myself. I need all progressives to join us.

It’s understandable that people have questions about what it means to be transgender. It’s a new topic for a lot of Americans, and most people haven’t had a personal experience meeting a transgender person yet. Stories like Heyer’s are very rare, but they are scary. But the truth is, transgender people do exist. We’re family members, friends, coworkers, fellow worshippers and community members. We live full and meaningful lives, and being transgender is only one part of that. More than anything, we want the opportunity to work hard and take care of ourselves, just like everyone else, without fear of stigma, humiliation or discrimination. It’s about freedom for everyone.

Embrace opioids alternatives

Letter to the editor:

As a practicing orthopedic surgeon, I applaud doctors Sesh Mudumbai, Randall Stafford and G. Caleb Alexander for highlighting the risks of postsurgical opioid use. While the national conversation often gravitates to the overuse of opioids for chronic pain, research continues to show that the surgical setting has become an unintentional gateway to long-term use, paving the way for dependence or addiction.

Despite the availability of effective alternatives, opioids continue to be overprescribed for postsurgical pain. In fact, a new analysis reveals that patients were prescribed nearly 100 to 200 pills to help treat pain from four common procedures.

Related:Having surgery? Beware of risk from post-op opioids

Fortunately, there is an emerging class of surgeons who embrace new alternatives to perform opioid-free surgeries for orthopedic and spine procedures, C-sections and more — a notion that was never thought possible. In my practice, patients receive surgeries that follow a multimodal pain management protocol, which includes FDA-approved opioid alternatives that include a long-acting local anesthetic that numbs the site of surgery for the duration of the most severe postsurgical pain.

It’s imperative surgeons and patients discuss pain management options prior to surgery. By removing or minimizing the use of opioids within the surgical suite, we can turn the tide on the epidemic.

Sanders is not a novel candidate anymore

Letter to the editor:

In classical rhetorical theory, the word “kairos” refers to the opportune time and/or place — that is, the right or appropriate time to say or do the right or appropriate thing. On Tuesday, timing remained a significant concept for understanding political events. Case in point: the announcement by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that he is running to be president in 2020.

In 2016, when Sanders mounted a strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, his message was rhetorically unique and persuasive — standing in sharp contrast to that of Hillary Clinton and others. This is no longer the case. Most of his progressive ideas — Medicare for All, free college tuition, higher taxes for the wealthy, etc. — are advocated by several candidates already in the Democratic race.

Related:How Bernie Sanders and Democrats can avoid the 2016 mistakes that gave us Donald Trump

But one might also argue that “kairos” works rhetorically against Sanders for another reason. President Donald Trump has set the agenda for the 2020 general election, potentially pre-empting Democratic proposals by making “socialism” an evil term. If what I am suggesting is true, Sanders may not be the best choice — and probably won’t be nominated.

I changed my mind on late-term abortion

Letter to the editor:

I have a great appreciation to Kate Carson for sharing her story in her column, ""I had a later abortion because I couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace,"" and bringing awareness to the issue of late-term abortions. I had never imagined that there were rational, humane and necessary reasons for these procedures. I stood on a pro-choice platform guided by a vague intuition of its progressiveness, putting the late-term question on the side.

Related:I had a later abortion because I couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace

As a mom, I’m so proud of Carson for making her baby’s story known. I had not before considered that there are circumstances in which life could be a cruelness to protect unborn children from. Hearing Carson’s family story, I understand now that a “choice” can be so obvious it isn’t a choice at all, and what I really mean to support are the options. From here on out, I will tell people I’m pro-option and explain, through Carson’s story, why and how this stance is different, and why it needs protection.

Both sides play politics on the wall

Letter to the editor:

Chris Truax's column, ""Donald Trump's emergency declaration is an attack on democracy,"" argues that President Donald Trump declared an emergency in order to fund the wall for political reasons. Yet the Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives have refused the president’s request for $5.7 billion to build the wall because of political reasons of their own.

Related:Democrats and Republicans flip all the time on border security

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want the president to “win” on this issue. What is $5.7 billion in our $19 trillion a year economy? One and a half modern aircraft carriers cost more. This whole business is right out of the Politics 101 textbook.

Record snowfall for February: Whoop de doo. As American athlete Terry Vaughn once said, records are made to be broken. The Twin Cities’ previous snowfall record for the month — 25.6 inches in 1962 — was easily eclipsed after Wednesday’s snowfall. Meh. Not impressed. It snows in Minnesota and it snows in February. Now, I will take notice if the following record is broken someday: The late Tom Amberry’s Guinness World Record 2,750 consecutive basketball free throws over 12 hours in one day. I made 12 in a row one time. I have a few more to catch up to the podiatrist from North Dakota. who accomplished his feat at the age of 71.

Minnesota politician on accused white supremacist’s hit list: It’s been quite a month for first-term Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. She was forced to apologize and take back anti-Semitic remarks and now her name appears on a deranged white supremacist’s hit list. The list found by the feds also included the names of other “liberal” politicians and media personalities such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer; and presidential contenders Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, who was identified as “Poca” Warren.

Domestic terrorism charges were filed against Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who stockpiled a cache of weapons and ammunition in his suburban Washington, D.C., apartment and wrote about wanting to blow away almost everyone on Earth (not him, of course). The case was publicly revealed the same week the Southern Poverty Law Center disclosed that 12 of the 1,020 documented white supremacist and other hate groups are located in Minnesota. Most of the Gopher State hate groups have anti-Muslim or neo-Nazi leanings. Of course, the self-proclaimed stable genius in the White House did not opine at all on the Coast Guard case or the hate-group report. But he felt compelled to tweet a rant about …

What was he thinking? The Jussie Smollett case. The 36-year-old “Empire” TV show actor reported to Chicago police a few weeks ago that he was accosted by two masked men who doused him with a bleach-like substance, roughed him up, put a noose around his neck and reportedly uttered, “This is MAGA country.” Smollett is black and gay. He went on national TV to describe his victimization.

I already smelled a rat, primarily because of the time of day the alleged assault happened — early morning hours when he supposedly went out to get a bite to eat while the Windy City was in the grip of polar vortex temperatures. At least 12 detectives — I repeat, 12 investigators — were put on the potential hate-crime incident.

According to charges filed last week, Smollett hired two brothers and staged the incident because he was not satisfied with the salary he was receiving from the popular TV show. Store surveillance cameras showed the brothers purchasing gloves, masks and rope before the incident. This was hardly well-thought-out.

If these reports are accurate, this hoax is absolute shameless disrespect and a slap in the face to true hate-crime victims, regardless of color, who may now think twice about filing police reports.

Smollett is also under investigation for allegedly creating a fake racist and threatening letter sent to the show days before the street incident.

“As I look into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson said in announcing the charges and Smollett’s arrest. “How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol (the noose) and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Trump’s tweet does not deserve repeating. You can look it up if you like. But it speaks volumes about where his heart truly lies.

A final farewell: Big and small businesses come and go. There was Gimbels in Manhattan. There was Dayton’s in downtown St. Paul. There was Juliana’s, a mom-and-pop coffee shop I frequented often when the Pioneer Press was located smack downtown and not across the river like now. Juliana, where are you? And now, after 30-plus years, Lowertown Foods is taking a final bow. The hole-in-the-wall grocery/comfort food spot tucked in the Saintly City’s skyway system served its regular customers homemade soups and sandwiches for more than three decades.

Its founder and owner, Betsy Frederick, a public health nurse by training, I am told, got to the place at around 4:30 most mornings to meet her clientele’s needs.

“On Mondays, she has served a hot beef stew or a pork stew or some very delicious protein dish,” Rick Cardenas, a loyal customer, told me. “On Wednesday, she would serve pasta with a marinara sauce or a tuna hot dish or a chicken hot dish or another great Minnesota hot dish.

“Betsy has a couple of soups she makes from scratch every day,” Cardenas added. “She has a creamy tomato soup a couple of times a week and a kielbasa/cabbage soup weekly and clam chowder on Fridays that some of the friendly harassing customers tease her about just dipping clams in and out for flavor.” Alas. Frederick declined an interview for this column.

“When was the last time you were turned down?” Cardenas asked in front of Frederick after I paid her visit to the place.

“Twice, in high school, and it affected me for the rest of my life,” I quipped.

I shook Frederick’s hand, respected her wishes and wished her well. The shop’s last day is Feb. 28."

Days earlier, Chicago prosecutors and police put the spotlight on what they alleged is one of the year's worst acting and directing performances by charging actor Jussie Smollett with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about an alleged hate crime against him.

Smollett had claimed that on one of the coldest evenings of the year in Chicago, he was jumped by two masked men who spewed homophobic and racial slurs while they beat him. Then shouted ""This is MAGA Country"" as they tossed a noose around his neck and doused him with bleach.

Chicago police contend their investigation uncovered the incident was staged and directed by Smollett with the help of two brothers who worked as extras on Smollett's show ""Empire"" and as his trainers.

Smollett staged the attack as a publicity stunt to increase his profile in order to increase his pay on the show, said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

It's being reported that some members of the ""Empire"" cast believe Smollett may have been trying to curry favor with ""Empire"" creator and producer Lee Daniels. On Instagram and on the set, Daniels had decried his cousin having been assaulted because he was gay.

In past interviews Smollett has also boasted about being a hard and tough critic of President Trump. That also shouldn't be discounted as possible motivating factor.

Smollett was released on 100,000 bound and still contends his hate crime report was not a hoax. The police, however, detailed what appears to be a solid investigation that produced solid evidence.

Cameras and Hate Crime Hoax Co-stars led to Smollett charge.

Ironically, Smollett, who makes his living acting before cameras was charged as the result of surveillance cameras. Johnson said cameras on the streets and in taxi cabs led them to brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, who allegedly carried out the attack at Smollett's direction.

A search of the Osundairo brothers residences and their and Smollett's phone records, also incriminated the three men.

The hoax that Smollett and the Osundairo brothers are accused of acting out does a disservice to true victims of hate crimes in the minority and LGBT communities. It's a repugnant callous disregard of the horrorify history of lynching in the United States.

In fact, one of the things that first made police suspicious of Smollett's story, was that he still had the rope draped around his neck, 40 minutes after the incident when police arrived. If the attack wasn't staged, what African-American man, knowing the history of lynching, would keep a rope around his neck for even a second after he was free of his attackers?

Victims of Smollett's alleged Hate Crime Hoax: Minorities, LGBT, Chicago, Trump and his supporters.

I've heard Smollett boast about being a hard critic of Trump, but what Smollett's now accused of has made Trump and his supporters among the victims of Smollett's alleged hate crime hoax.

While Trump has blown the racist dog whistles plenty of times, the KKK didn't put him in The White House, Independent voters, disgruntled Democrats and former Obama voters wanting economic change did.

Smollett has just thrown the lowest denominator of Trump's base red meat.

Harris, Booker and Trump had condemned the attack before it was confirmed

Conservatives who are criticizing Kamala Harris and Corey Booker for being too quick to condemn Smollett's attack before it was confirmed, should remember that President Trump also condemned the attack when it was first reported. I can't blame them. Who would think an African-American male would stage such a vile racist attack on himself ?

Chicago didn't need Smollett adding to its problems

Perhaps the biggest victim is the city of Chicago and it's police department. USA TODAY reports that during the time Smollett's report was being investigated there were 18 homicides and dozens of shootings.

""Among the victims of gun violence were 1-year-old Dejon Irving, who was shot in the head on Feb. 7 as he sat in a car with his siblings and grandmother. The boy remains in critical condition. Police believe the assailants were targeting his mother.""

Police Superintendent Johnson contrasted that amount of media attention given Smollett.

""I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention, because that's who deserves the amount of attention we're giving this particular incident.""

Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream that didn't involve staged hate crimes. His dream is personified by the work and achievements of actors and directors like Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, Lee Daniels, Donald Glover, Spike Lee and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson."

(CNN) — Actor Terrence Howard is supporting his television son, Jussie Smollett, after he was accused of staging a hate crime attack last month in Chicago.

Smollett plays Howard’s son, Jamal, on “Empire,” a Fox drama about a family dynasty set in the alluring world of hip-hop.

In a post on social media, Howard shared his love for the actor with a video of a baby sitting on Smollett’s lap and breaking into fits of giggles when Smollett tickles him.

“All your lil homies got you. We love the hell outta you,” he captioned the video along with a heart emoji at the end.

Howard to fan: Not your job to judge

In one of the comments under the video, a fan criticized him for supporting Smollett, and Howard fired back with a lengthy message defending his decision.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he posted. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Smollett was arrested Thursday on a felony charge of disorderly conduct over falsely claiming he was attacked, Chicago police said

Authorities said Smollett was dissatisfied with his salary on the show and wanted publicity when he filed a police report saying two men attacked him and threw a noose around his neck on January 29 in Chicago.

He allegedly staged the attack by paying two brothers $3,500 to target him, police said. The men bought masks and a noose to use in the attack, and the actor directed them on what epithets to hurl when they attacked him, officials said.

Before the alleged attack, Smollett made sure the neighborhood had security cameras to ensure the assault would be recorded, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said Thursday.

“But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction,” he said.

Smollett reported the attack to police who investigated it as a possible hate crime. But as the story unfolded over the weeks, it started unraveling with twists and turns that culminated with his arrest on suspicion of filing a false police report.

‘Empire’ cast hasn’t said much since his arrest

The show’s main cast has not commented much since Smollett’s role in the attack changed from victim to suspect. But Howard expressed his shock when news of the alleged attack initially surfaced.

Smollett has maintained that he did not make up the story, and he has reiterated to the “Empire” cast and crew he was innocent of the charge against him.

His attorneys have said they plan to mount “an aggressive defense.”

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” his attorneys said in a statement.

Under Illinois law, filing a false police report is disorderly conduct and punishable by one to three years in prison. Smollett is due back in court March 14.

Executive producers of “Empire” said last week that while they were waiting for the legal process to play out, they would remove Smollett’s character from the season’s final two episodes."

From the start, Johnson refused to comment other than to treat the so-called victim as a victim until all the facts of the case were thoroughly investigated. Detectives did a brilliant job of investigating a very difficult and serious accusation and showed not only professional competence but also what can be accomplished when police and citizens work together for the common good. Long after Smollett passes into history, Chicagoans can take pride in a department that showed it’s always wise to wait for the facts to come out, no matter the pressure involved."

Jussie Smollett

The 49-year-old actor has spoken out in defence of his co-star - who is being investigated over reports he orchestrated an alleged homophobic and racist attack on himself - following the news producers have decided he will not be returning to set to shoot the final two episodes of the drama.

Terrence shared a video of his son Hero playing with Jussie on a private jet, and wrote on Instagram: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you""

Producers are keen to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show, and so have simply written Jussie's character, Jamal Lyon, out of the finale.

Producers including Lee Daniels and Danny Strong said in a statement to The Blast: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our 'Empire' family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Jussie appeared in court on Thursday (21.02.19), where he was ordered to pay a $10,000 bond and surrender his passport after being arrested on felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.

After the hearing, he headed straight to the Cinespace Studio in Chicago where he became ""very emotional"" as he maintained his innocence in a speech to the cast and crew of the show.

He reportedly said: ""I'm sorry I've put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I'm sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.""

Jussie was later praised by his legal team as a ""young man of impeccable character"" in a statement that hit out at the way the investigation has been handled.

The lawyers said in a statement: ""Today we witnessed an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

""Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."""

Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been supported by Terrence Howard and his son Hero after his co-star said ""we love the hell outta you"".

The 49-year-old actor has spoken out in defence of his co-star - who is being investigated over reports he orchestrated an alleged homophobic and racist attack on himself - following the news producers have decided he will not be returning to set to shoot the final two episodes of the drama.

Howard shared a video of his son Hero playing with Jussie on a private jet, and wrote on Instagram: ""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you""

Producers are keen to ""avoid further disruption"" to the show, and so have simply written Jussie's character, Jamal Lyon, out of the finale.

On January 29, the day of Smollett’s alleged hoax attack, Daniels tweeted, “We got this,” accompanied by rainbow and black hand emojis.

“We believe that the officials and celebrities who rushed to support Jussie Smollett should retract their statements and apologize for their haste in supporting him to the detriment of others,” Nicholas Sposato, Chicago 38th ward aldermen and Anthony Napolitano, Chicago’s 41st ward alderman, said in a joint statement.

The local leaders also took Smollett to task for thrusting Chicago back into the national spotlight over simmering racial tensions.

“The reputation of our city has suffered irreparable damage during these troubling times,” they said. “Chicago did not need or deserve the unfair publicity that resulted from these seemingly false accusations.”

Chicago police charged Smollett Thursday with filing a false report for allegedly staging a Jan. 29 attack on himself and making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him last month. He said they threw bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and said it was “MAGA” country, referring to President Trump’s supporters, during the assault.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the tv star calling the Smollett saga “simply shameful.”

Smollett has denied making up the attack.

The aldermen said the Smollett case should “serve as an example of how rushing to judgment without proper facts and investigation can hurt all of us.”

“If our city is to heal, we need to not be so quick to rush to judgment, let the police do their jobs and begin treating each other with respect and dignity,” they said. “Are you listening, Mr. Smollett?”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) were some of the high-profile politicians who spoke out on behalf of Smollett after the attack was first made public.

Among celebrities who spoke out, director Rob Reiner (above right) initially tweeted: “The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving. No intolerance! No DT!”

Reiner has deleted his tweet.

On January 29, actor Billy Eichner tweeted that Trump and “all MAGA lunatics” should “burn in hell.” He, too, has deleted the tweet.

Singer Katy Perry tweeted on January 29: “Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today… This is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country.”

Actress Olivia Munn also weighed in, tweeting, “Jussie Smollett was violently attacked by two white men who poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. He was targeted for being black and for being gay. THIS is why we have to have zero tolerance against homophobia and racism.

#1 Leftists No Longer Having Sex: Is It Trump’s Fault?

By Graham J. Noble

Insane, Trump-hating sex therapist helps Salon fill webpage with more nonsense.

Every once in a while – or, these days, every 47 minutes – some leftist comes completely unglued and starts ranting about President Donald Trump and all those who support him. The depths to which these leftists stoop, as they vent their unbridled hatred of all those who refuse to accept their world-view, seem to have no limit. Yet, even the most demented of social justice warriors and other progressives can still surprise us.

Salon is one of those sites that cater to such people. For the past two years, it has been consumed by extreme animosity toward not only the president but to all things conservative, Republican, white, heterosexual or Christian.

Salon’s rage at the world goes even beyond those things, however: The publication actually seems to pour venom and scorn upon anything and everything that has ever been accepted – rightly or not – as conventional. Salon’s slogan should, perhaps, be: “If there’s nothing wrong with you, there’s something wrong with you.” Read More.

#2 The Disappearing Democratic Scandal – Part 2

By Tim Donner

The media, the DOJ, and the Democrats: A powerful axis with the ability to shape what we perceive as the issue of the day.

Editor’s note: This is the second of a two-part series on a massive scandal which has gone largely unreported, based on an interview on Liberty Nation Radiowith Luke Rosiak, author of Obstruction of Justice: How the Deep State Risked National Security to Protect the Democrats. In part one, Mr. Rosiak described how the scandal unfolded and jeopardized the security of more than two dozen Democratic members of Congress.

It was a scandal that threatened to metastasize and blow up in the face of Democrats in a presidential election year like no other. But with the Hillary Clinton email scandal growing by the day, Democrats willing to do almost anything to avoid the specter of a Donald Trump presidency, the FBI burying their findings and a drive-by media behaving with a distinct lack of curiosity, few people took notice.

Imram Awam, an IT specialist and Pakistani national with a checkered past, yet unvetted by the many congressional Democrats who employed his services, took advantage of the unfettered access he was granted to their computer files to hack, steal, blackmail – and even threaten to kill his wife’s family – in the process placing national security in distinct jeopardy.

#3 It’s The Social Victimhood Economy, Stupid!

By Jeff Charles

In this economy, the victimhood capitalist is king.

The case of Jussie Smollett is looking more and more like a fake hate crime. As more information is revealed, it has become increasingly difficult to believe his story of being attacked at 2 a.m. in Chicago by Trump supporters. While the public is not yet certain that the actor orchestrated the entire affair, many on both the left and the right are asking an important question: “Why?”

Over the past few years, hate crimes have increased. But false reports also seem to be on the rise. If Smollett’s statements turn out to be false, it could potentially be the most high-profile fake hate crime the nation has seen in many years.

There are likely several forces that could contribute to such hoaxes, but none more so than society’s fixation on victimhood. Indeed, with the progressive left — and even many on the right — pushing a constant narrative of grievance, they have created an entire social economy based on victimization. Read More.

#4 The Numbers Don’t Lie – Why Trump Wins 2020

By Mark Angelides

The very future of the Democratic Party is under threat.

Campaigns for the 2020 presidential election have begun in earnest. Every rally, each interview, are part of an unwieldy creature known as the campaign trail. Politicians of all stripes are begging for airtime and making sweeping statements on every imaginable topic in the hopes of earning a few more column inches. But perhaps it is all for naught? According to all major gambling outfits, President Trump is odds on favorite to win the race in 2020. Following the money is always wise advice, yet there are other signs that Trump may be well on his way to victory. On Monday February 11, Trump took his campaign to El Paso, where he wooed the crowd with promises of the border wall and reminded them of his achievements to date – standard fare for the man who believes himself a master of persuasion. Putting his rhetoric aside, there was something truly startling about the crowd that attended, and it likely has Democrats fearing for the future of their party. Of those who registered as attendees, 70% identified as Hispanic, and almost 50% identified as Democrat voters. If these numbers are accurate, it could spell major problems for the DNC, not just in the next election cycle, but for years and years to come. Read More.

#5 Left Paints A Bullseye On Patriots

By Joe Schaeffer

The voices of “tolerance” foster climate of violence against Trump supporters.

Leftists and their media allies constantly bemoan what they call President Trump’s “divisiveness.” Yet they not only never address anti-Trump intolerance in this country but also continuously fan the flames of partisan fanaticism in a dangerous manner that is going to get somebody killed. It’s sad enough that white teenagers cannot wear Make America Great Again hats at a rally in Washington, D.C., without having their entire world thrown into complete turmoil. But what has our nation come to when folks can’t even go to a Sam’s Club in Kentucky without taking their lives in their hands just for publicly supporting their president?

Terry Pierce and his wife were shopping at a Sam’s in Bowling Green, KY, while daring to wear MAGA hats. As they walked the aisles, they noticed another customer flipping them the bird. When they asked the man, James Phillips, if he did what they thought he did, he let them know it was because of their hats. They then responded in kind, and the man promptly pulled a gun, pointed it at them, and said, “This is a good day for you to die.” Read More."

The actor claimed he was slugged by two strangers who called him a “f—-t,” a “n—-r” and shouted, “This is MAGA country!” just outside his apartment before dousing him in bleach and throwing a rope around his neck.

Chicago authorities said he plotted the bizarre scheme to bolster his own career and get a raise.

Smollett denies it was a hoax, and has told cops he has an “untreated” drug problem.

Smollett’s character on “Empire” will be removed from the final two episodes of this season in the wake of his arrest. Fox has requested security from Cook County cops when it films scenes for an episode on Wednesday.

In the West, we’re not merely living at present through savage culture wars. We’re not merely experiencing a terrifying eruption of anti-Semitism in supposedly civilized countries. We are being subjected to a manipulation of reality that could have been scripted by Franz Kafka.

The gay, black actor Jussie Smollett claimed that he was set upon in Chicago, after buying a sandwich in the middle of a pulverizingly cold night last month, by attackers who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, shouted “this is MAGA country,” poured an unknown chemical over him and placed a noose around his neck.

This bizarre account was then said to have been a hoax, with Smollett reportedly having paid two men to orchestrate an assault on him. He denied this; but now he has been charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.

A lot of people now find themselves under an uncomfortable spotlight.

From the start, it was clear that Smollett’s story was far-fetched and inconsistent. Yet it was instantly leapt upon as unchallengeably true.

Democrat presidential hopeful Cory Booker tweeted that it was “an attempted modern-day lynching.” The Washington Post’s “identity politics” reporter Eugene Scott wrote that Smollett’s “experience” was “far too common for black gay men, particularly those who speak out against racism and sexism.”

Others said it showed the ugly truth of U.S. President Trump’s America. Actress Ellen Page urged people to “connect the dots,” accusing Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of hating gay people and wanting to cause them suffering.

Anyone who questioned Smollett’s story was denounced as a hate-monger.

The truth of this episode has yet to be resolved. Yet more broadly, there has been a huge number of hoaxes and fraudulent claims about hate crimes that have been seized upon as true despite clear evidence to the contrary.

Last September, Christine Blasey Ford could recall few of the circumstances surrounding the sexual assault she said to have endured as a teenager at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, who was being nominated as a justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee found not enough evidence for her claim.

Yet despite this, her story was not only widely believed, but anyone who questioned it was accused of endorsing male violence against women.

Last month, as a result of selectively edited video footage, boys from Covington Catholic High School demonstrating against abortion and wearing MAGA caps were accused of racially abusing an elderly Native American. The boys were subjected to hate campaigns; the school even had to close for a day following the incident. When the full video was revealed, however, the boys were found to have been themselves the victims of abuse and intimidation by another group on the scene.

And let’s not overlook the unprecedented attempt to prove that Trump had colluded with Russia to “steal” the presidential election he subsequently won.

Not only has no such evidence at all been discovered. Evidence has steadily emerged that elements of the FBI and Justice Department and other officials used the Hillary Clinton campaign’s opposition “research” to mount an unlawful spying operation on team Trump in order to abort his presidency.

The former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was fired last year after being said by the Inspector General to have “lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions,” has now claimed in a book and associated interviews that he plotted with others in the FBI to remove the president by any means necessary.

These astounding claims have been largely pooh-poohed or ignored. For as with many left-wing causes, factual evidence is dismissed as irrelevant.

This is because whichever issue underpins the left’s uproar of the day constitutes a “fact” that is as incontrovertible as a papal bull under the medieval Inquisition.

So Blasey Ford had to be believed because of the incontrovertible “fact” that Kavanaugh was anti-abortion and therefore had to be stopped at all costs from being appointed to the Supreme Court.

The Covington boys had to be abusers because of the incontrovertible “fact” that Trump supporters in MAGA caps go out looking for minorities to beat up.

Even now, McCabe is still claiming with no evidence whatever that it’s possible that Trump is a Russian asset.

Asked about the claims that the Smollett story was a hoax, Booker doubled down. “Bigoted and biased attacks” were seriously on the rise, he said, and most terrorist attacks since 9/11 had been “right-wing,” a majority of them “white supremacist attacks.” So he avoided the issue of truth and swerved back instead to his overriding agenda: bashing the right.

Meanwhile, real attacks on Jews are being ignored. On the night that Smollett claimed he was attacked, a Jewish man in New York was beaten up by three thugs.

The NYPD reports that more than twice as many hate crimes—most of them against Jews—occurred last month as in January last year. Last October, The New York Times reported there had been four times as many crimes against Jews as against black people, while anti-Jewish hate crimes outnumbered those against transgender people by a factor of 20.

This receives virtually no attention. That’s because anti-Semitism is a bigotry that’s prevalent on the left and among the groups it favors. So it gets in the way of the narrative that reframes reality to accord with left-wing shibboleths.

Such falsifications are justified on the grounds that they illustrate a “broader truth.” But they are in fact lies.

And the really mind-bending thing is that these are deployed to demonstrate the user’s moral superiority. For many on the left create right-wing monsters merely to prove their own virtue and make themselves unchallengeable.

That’s why Washington Post editorial board assistant Nana Efua Mumford said she was broken-hearted to discover the Smollett story was almost certainly a hoax.

“The incident,” she mourned, “would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists. It would be the very embodiment of ‘fake news.’ And that reason, more than any other, is why I need this story to be true … ”

And it’s why American Jews who vote Democrat are muted or silent about the virulent anti-Semitism of people like Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan or Democrat congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Having told themselves falsely that Trump is a mortal threat to Jews, black people or Muslims, they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that the most dangerous enemies of the Jewish people are on their own side—and that it’s Trump who is their target, not the other way round.

Hoaxes are a kind of false flag operation to cast as villains the victims of such attacks. They are a hallmark of Soviet communism’s strategy of psychological warfare in creating a looking-glass world where nothing is what it seems.

Israel is a prime victim of this hoax politics. The whole Palestinian narrative—cooked up originally by Yasser Arafat in cahoots with the former Soviet Union—is a false flag operation, a hoax that falsely blames its Israeli victim of appalling crimes of which it is innocent but of which the Palestinian perpetrator is itself guilty.

Hoax politics is an example of cultural totalitarianism that fries the brain and creates a climate of political, intellectual and moral chaos.

It’s why so many of us feel that the world has spun off its axis of reason altogether. And it’s why the whole anti-Israel and anti-Jew pathology that has erupted in the West is part of a broader and devastating cultural nervous breakdown.

Remember, before the Jussie Smollett scandal, the controversy over New York’s new state law allowing abortion up until birth?

And Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s defense of infanticide?

Now Vermont, with Democrats in the majority, has gone further, and talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh is warning that the Democratic Party is “becoming sick, and it’s getting sicker by the day.”

“‘Mamas, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up,’ the new theme song of the Democrat Party. ‘Mamas, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up,’ not to be cowboys or anything,” he said. “I’m telling you, folks, you want to find out – you want to know – why there’s rampant crime? You want to know why inexplicable deterioration is happening to our culture? Look no further than this kind of thinking.”

Limbaugh decried the “wanton devaluing of life and the total loss of the appreciation for the sanctity of life and for the miracle of life.”

“To just casually be able to discard this? By a political party? You don’t think that has deleterious, dramatically destructive impacts on society at large? Thirteen-year-olds are shooting 10-year-olds and people are asking themselves, ‘How can this happen?’ Look no further than stuff like this,” he said.

“If life is cheap, if life is not special, if life doesn’t have anything noteworthy about it, then nobody is going to have any appreciation for it at any stage of it. My God, this is Satanic! This is just – and they pass these bills and they end up applauding and whooping it up, and I still maintain that one of the primary reasons for that is that they are celebrating victory over us, that they are just loving cramming it down our throats. They love getting in our face and telling us to go to hell, and this is one of the ways in which they’re doing it.”

He said his concern was raised by a vote in the Vermont legislature to pass H. 57, “which would legalize abortion at any stage of pregnancy and for any reason.”

“Folks, they are off to the races on this. First it was the New York State Senate with a standing ovation after the law was passed that you can even perform an abortion during birth and after! They stood up with a standing ovation. Shortly after that, the governor of Virginia came out, Ralph Northam, and he basically endorsed the same thing. And then we heard that out of New Mexico, they are working on similar legislation.”

The Vermont bill states, “Every individual who becomes pregnant has the fundamental right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, give birth to a child, or to have an abortion.”

Limbaugh explained the legislation “is far more radical than the recent expansion of late-term abortion in New York, as well as the proposed expansions in Virginia and Rhode Island.”

The New York and Virginia bills allow abortion for any reason up to viability and have “health” exceptions that are often loosely interpreted to permit abortion on demand after viability as well.

But the Vermont bill “offers a blanket permission slip for any and all abortion, throughout pregnancy, and for any reason.”

Further, the bill specifically dehumanizes the unborn, stating, “A fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus shall not have independent rights under Vermont law.”"

TMZ has obtained documents that on the surface back his claim the $3,500 check he wrote to Abel was for training. The check was written to Abel on January 23, 2019, six days before the ""attack."" The memo line reads, ""5 week Nutrition/Workout program Don't Go.""

Sources connected to Jussie tell us, the reference to ""Don't Go"" is a song for which Jussie was going to shoot a music video ... featuring himself shirtless. The sources say Jussie had gained weight -- he was 192 lbs and needed to lose 20 pounds for the shoot, and that's why he hired Abel ... whom he says he calls ""Bon.""

There are various texts starting from January 20 between Jussie and Bon. On January 28 -- the day before the ""attack"" -- Bon wrote, ""I know you're traveling today, make sure you get at least 45 mins of cardio.""

Another text on January 20 outlines a menu for the day, including chicken thigh, StarKist Tuna, Eggs and Smucker's peanut butter. And, a text on January 25 reads, ""This is the meal plan and the breakdown of macronutrients. Also includes projected fat loss.""

You also see a text showing a calendar where February 23 is marked ""Don't Go."" The sources say that's the date of the music video shoot.

There's another screenshot from Sept. 27, 2018, presumably showing Jussie has paid Ola in the past. It's a Venmo payment of $100 to Bola (Abimbola aka Abel) for ""Training.""

Sources connected to Jussie say the $3,500 breakdown is as follows -- $600 a week for the workout plan for 5 weeks, and $100 a week for the nutrition plan for 5 weeks.

As we reported, Ola and Abel also told the grand jury the payment was for training.

This is not proof the attack wasn't staged, but in a trial, all the defense has to do is create reasonable doubt, and we're told the Police Superintendent's pronouncement will become a defense weapon if the case goes to trial.

The Police Superintendent also said during the news conference Jussie himself sent the racist letter 8 days before the attack. Federal law enforcement sources tell us they have not concluded who wrote the letter ... at least not yet."

The disease of anti-Semitism is not new to France, and it has been spreading. But a new threshold in response to it was set by the displays of outrage as a result of the verbal assault on Alain Finkielkraut, a well known intellectual who was walking on the Boulevard du Montparnasse in Paris on February 16, 2019. The perpetrators were a small group, members of the gilets jaunes, the yellow vest movement. The main suspect is a salesman from Mulhouse in eastern Alsace. The group shouted at Finkielkraut, in non-academic terms, ""Dirty Zionist s---"" and ""Go back to Tel Aviv"" and ""France belongs to us,"" among other choice expressions. Alain Finkielkraut is a 69-year-old Jewish philosopher, an eminent man of letters, and a public intellectual — a distinguished academic, since 2014 a member of the Académie Française, the prestigious council of 40 concerned with matters related to the French language. Contrary to the fabrications of the yellow vest attackers, he was born in Paris, though his father was a Polish Holocaust-survivor of Auschwitz. Ironically, Finkielkraut initially supported the Y.V. movement when it started two months ago, but then he criticized its members for destruction without regard for anyone or anything.

Finkielkraut emerged in public in the May 1968 student revolt and in 1987 with his book, The Defeat of the Mind, that was critical of postmodern philosophy and cultural relativism. He is a controversial figure, appearing on TV, writing articles for prominent newspapers, and giving interviews, known as an opponent of mass migration into France, a critic of multiculturalism, and a defender of the West. He is a concerned with Jewish identity in postwar Europe and is a strong advocate of Israel. Since he was addressed by the Y.V. attackers as a ""dirty Jew,"" the Paris prosecutor is inquiring whether this is a crime, a public insult related to origin, ethnicity, race, or religion. Finkielkraut is not the only prominent Jewish figure to be assaulted. Another was Simone Weil, survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, French minister of health, proponent of women's legal rights, advocate of legislation for abortion in 1975 and for a ban on smoking, president of the European Parliament, appointed to Académie Française in 2008. She is the fifth woman in history to be given, in July 2018, a burial in the Pantheon in Paris. Swastikas were painted on public postboxes that had her face on them. On February 18, 2019, a group of French members of the National Assembly introduced a bill to make anti-Zionism a criminal offense in the same way that anti-Semitism is illegal in France. This touches on a controversial issue. For many years, critics of the State of Israel or its actions or political figures have argued that such criticism is appropriate and that conflating this with anti-Semitism is misguided. Others have responded that though criticism of Israeli actions or policies is legitimate, calls for the destruction of the State and espousers of BDS can be regarded as a manifestation of anti-Semitism. Central to the issue is the accurate and acceptable definition of the disease of anti-Semitism. A valuable, if still controversial, working definition has been provided by the IHRA, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, a group of 31 countries. It started in October 2013 as a statement on Holocaust denial and discrimination, followed at a meeting in Bucharest on May 26, 2016 by a fuller definition of anti-Semitism. All parties agree that anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as hatred toward them. All can also agree that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitism. The basic problem is that not all parties agree that a double standard exists for many countries and organizations by requiring of Israel a pattern of behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. The significant, though controversial, contribution of the IHRA to the definition is that anti-Semitism includes targeting the State of Israel conceived as a Jewish collectivity. Because of the international incessant condemnation of Israel, anti-Zionism is one of the modern forms of anti-Semitism. The IHRA declaration is not legally binding, but it is a guideline, and one that was accepted by Britain and Germany in 2016. It was also accepted by President Macron on February 20, 2019. ""We must name the evil: anti-Semitism is hiding behind the mask of anti-Zionism. The time has come for action."" Macron acted immediately by declaring no toleration of anti-Semitism, ordering the French Interior Ministry to dismantle three neo-Nazi groups. He visited the Holocaust memorial in Paris. Macron responded immediately to the attack on Finkielkraut, asserting that the anti-Semitic insults are the complete negation of ""who we are"" and what makes France a great nation. Anti-Semitism is a repudiation of the Republic. Other prominent public figures followed his example: François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy joined the demonstration of thousands of people in the Place de la République in Paris, who displayed banners with Ça suffit (that's enough). Macron denounced the unacceptable increase in acts and hate speech, which he linked to the recent wave of demonstrations against his government, by the yellow vest rallies. Anti-Semitism is not a slogan of the Y.V. movement, but there are extremists among its members responsible for racist and anti-Semitic remarks, as well as attacks on legislators. It is sad that some in the Y.V. movement believe in a Zionist plot or conspiracy. In a sense, their behavior resembles that of the black American actor Jussie Smollett, charged in Chicago on February 21, 2019 with filing a false report that he was attacked for racial reasons. In both cases, the perpetrators took advantage of justifiable anger at expressions of racism and existing discrimination to spread their message of hate. More attention is now being paid in France to anti-Semitism, which Christophe Castaner, minister of the interior, says is spreading like a poison. In 2018, there were 641 anti-Semitic acts and threats, an increase of 74% from 311 in 2017. A few can be mentioned. Graves, more than 90, of Jews were vandalized with swastikas in the cemetery in the small village of Quatzenheim, a village near Strasbourg. Macron, wearing a skullcap, attended a ceremony at the gravesite. Among the more egregious previous anti-Semitic attacks in 2012 were the killing of four people, a rabbi and three children, in the Jewish school in Toulouse in southwest France, and the murder of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old phone salesman, of Jewish Moroccan ancestry, who was kidnapped and tortured for three weeks in 2006 and died from burn injuries on the way to the hospital. A tree planted in his memory in the Paris suburb of Sainte-Geneviève-du-Bois was chopped down. On February 19, 2019, two teenagers were arrested after firing, by air rifle, at a synagogue in the Paris suburb of Sarcelles. The next day, February 20, two swastikas accompanied by a phrase denying the Holocaust were painted on a monument in a Jewish cemetery in Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, near Lyon. You don't have to be Jewish to like bagels, but a bagel factory, of the Bagelstein chain, in the east of Paris, in the Ile Saint-Louis district, was defaced with the word ""Juden"" in German painted in yellow across the window. It is unclear whether the color referred to the Y.V. movement or to the Star of David arm bands Jews were forced to wear by Nazi Germany. French politicians have asserted that anti-Semitism is deeply rooted in French society. The country is familiar with attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions by political extremists and Islamists, but the link to the yellow vests came as a surprise. The disease of anti-Semitism may be turning into a plague. We must recognize, as Albert Camus, wrote in The Plague, that the next plague will ""rouse up its rats again."" Radical surgery is essential to correct the severe cancerous threat to society in France as elsewhere."

Nothing offends people more than unequal justice -- disparate treatment of protected persons and classes. This week, the FBI and Department of Justice’s hash of equal justice became even clearer and the media’s fat thumb on the scales as well.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse because -- in fired FBI Director James Comey’s formulation -- a “higher duty” than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Or -- in fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s words -- “the threat” was too great. Never mind that the nature of “the threat” was that the people might elect someone he and Mr. Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected. The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination. The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election... The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the press to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureau’s ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as “an insurance policy” against his filling the office to which he was elected.

He asserts, and I agree, that the defamation campaign against the president continues with the now-debunked tale of racism by the Covington students and the thoroughly debunked tale of assault on Jussie Smollett.

I believe the concept of “hate crimes” is an oxymoron. If you assault or murder someone it’s fair to assume it was out of improper animus. Adding a kicker for “hate” in which attacks on certain classes of people result in enhanced sentences strikes me as an improper “thought crime” punishment, inconsistent with constitutional law.

In any event, the laws on hate crimes seem to be as selectively enforced as the crimes of mishandling and leaking classified material and attempting to overthrow the president. Here too the press plays an important part, demonizing the President’s supporters, and downplaying or not reporting hate crimes against them while regularly magnifying defamatory and false accusations against them.

The criminal misconduct in the federal executive continues, inspired doubtless by the failure to prosecute people like Hillary and Lois Lerner. This week we learned that IRS intelligence officer John C. Fry made an unauthorized excursion into Michael Cohen’s financial records and passed them on to porn lawyer Michael Avenetti and the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow. And he’s not the only U.S. Treasury employee using access to invade the privacy of the Special Counsel’s targets. Last October Natalie Mayflower Sours-Edwards was arrested and charged with leaking to the press ”financial transactions related to Paul Manafort, Richard Gates , Maria Butina, and others.”

Certain I am that they were motivated by total unconcern for any criminal consequences for their acts.

Media misconduct matches official misconduct.

When not calling Trump supporters “Nazis” as a means to dehumanize us, the establishment media like to whine about the lack of civility in American politics, even as they cover up, ignore, downplay, or straight-up approve of the wave of violence and public harassment we are seeing against supporters of President Trump. It is open season on Trump supporters, and the media is only fomenting, encouraging, excusing, and hoping for more… The media are now openly calling Trump supporters “Nazis” and are blaming Trump for a mass murder he had nothing to do with. This, of course, is a form of harassment because it incites and justifies mob violence. Here is the list so far and remember that if any one of these things happened to a Democrat, the media would use the story to blot out the sun for weeks. Remember how crazy the media went over a nobody rodeo clown who wore an Obama mask, a GOP staffer who criticized Obama’s daughters? And yet, hundreds of Trump supporters are harassed and brutalized and the media only dutifully report them, if at all. That is because the media are desperate to normalize and justify violence and harassment against Trump and his supporters.

Along with selective enforcement and media coverage of hate crimes, comes a plethora of hoax hate crimes. Here’s a list of 342 of them. In fact, hoax claims of hate crimes are now so common, I must admit my first response is to doubt the claim.

My online friend, “The Infamous Ignatz” expresses my view.

It's funny how the sanctimony of the left works. Time after time these fake stories are created that allege hateful actions by horrible right-wingers with implications for all conservatives and lectures about how we need to disown these phantom miscreants. When the stories are revealed to be hoaxes motivated by a particularly loathsome political animus, the best that ever occurs is ""oops"". Why don't progs as a class have to denounce the stereotyped hatefulness their crazy ass prog pals display and that they capitalize on? People who don't even exist who say ""MAGA country, faggot"" are still a teachable moment for the deplorable half of the country. A bunch of hateful liars who defame the deplorable half of the country by making up ""MAGA country, faggot"" and who actually exist, well, they're just a little misguided... because of Trump and his horrible deplorable supporters!! But they're the sensible tolerant ones. Just ask them. Then go read a prog comments section. It's like listening to schizophrenics describing their hallucinations like everyone must see or hear them.

The case of Jussie Smollett was particularly egregious. Only a moron would believe his claim that at 2 a.m. in freezing weather during the polar vortex in a neighborhood where I doubt there is a single Trump supporter. Trump supporters attacked B actor for being a gay black man. And yet the media fell for it. Had it been true, in any event, it hardly warranted the degree of attention it got. Consider just some of the other events which barely got any coverage while this hoax was trumpeted. The deadlock on the export of 1.2 million tons of LNG was broken -- a blow to Putin’s shaky economy. We moved closer to a deal for denuclearization of Korea through first steps like helping North Korea improve its rail infrastructure and encouraging family visits between North and South Korea. The Caliphate in Syria has fallen. And the Dow posted nine weeks of advances in a row -- the longest weekly streak of gains in almost 24 years as we move closer to a U.S.-China trade deal. In Warsaw, Arab and Israeli leaders broke bread together and worked side by side to discuss real threats to peace in the Middle East. And yet, the media focused public attention on Smollett’s certainly fake hate crime, and like cats following a laser beam all else was ignored.

Worse, there’s some reason to believe this was not the work of an actor dissatisfied with his pay scale, as he said when finally nabbed. There’s some good reason -- not proven but plausible -- to believe he was working with his close friend Kamala Harris, whose effort to enact a base-pleasing anti-lynching bill was stalled. Cory Booker, in fact, tweeted he hoped this incident would induce Congress to pass the bill.

Cory Booker ✔ @CoryBooker The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe. To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime -- I urge you to pay attention.

Former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clark is in that camp of those who think there was a political angle to the hoax.

“I’m not buying that @JussieSmollett staged his hoax due to a salary dispute with FOX studios. I’m not that gullible. AND DON’T YOU FALL FOR IT EITHER! Smollett was on a POLITICAL MISSION for the left. He’s part of the slimy Hollywood elite. #MAGA2020” Clarke tweeted.



Clarke also said he “can’t wait” for the FBI to announce federal charges against Smollett for mailing a “hoax letter” to the television studio, noting that it’s a crime punishable by five to 10 years in federal prison.



“Can’t wait for the FBI to hold their news conference to announce FEDERAL CHARGES against @JussieSmollett for mailing that hoax letter to the studio. That is MAIL FRAUD punishable by 5-10 years in federal prison. Don’t turn away from this folks or it will go away. #MAGA2020,” Clarke tweeted.

In any event, Smollett also has close ties with Democrat politicians, among them the Obamas, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker. Booker and Harris vouched for his credibility and promoted the hoax.

He also has ties to numerous Hollywood characters who like Democratic politicians. My favorite meathead, Rob Reiner, who never misses a chance to miss, immediately blamed his hallucinatory vision of Trump and Trump supporters. He also has ties to numerous Hollywood characters who like Democratic politicians supported Smollett's false claim.He tweeted:

The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving. No intolerance! No DT! --Rob Reiner (@robreiner) January 30, 2019

Tonight is Oscars night, with an expected lower than ever viewing audience. Smollett says he’s checking into rehab and now blames drug addiction for the hoax. So many Hollywood miscreants are in rehab these days; I expect that’s where the best Oscar parties will take place. Like most of us, I’m still waiting to see what happens to the jerks that fomented the hoax Russian collusion story."

Identity politics, plus a terrible banking crisis in the last 30 days of the 2008 campaign, gave us President Obama.

Is she a good presidential candidate? Is she capable of thinking on her feet? Is she too eager to please the leftist corner to make it all the way?

Over the last month, we've seen Senator Harris step in you know what a few times, as Matthew Continetti wrote:

What trips up Kamala Harris is an evident desire to please her audience. She wants no enemies to her left, no identity politics left untouched. She can't run as a prosecutor — crime fighting is so 1990s — but she can run as brash, bold, and woke. Her verbal miscues are possible evidence that this latest political fashion doesn't quite fit. She has made a habit of making unforced errors, and the game is only in its first month. Harris's Democratic opponents may be too blinkered or bashful to exploit this weakness. That will not be a problem for her Republican opponent.

Yes, especially with President Trump as her opponent or V.P. Pence in a debate if she is V.P. Biden's choice as a running mate.

To be fair, it's early, and she could learn to be more disciplined down the road. At the same time, she may not.

Her first mistake was to call for the end of private insurance, an issue that makes no sense to millions of Americans who get it that way.

Her silly comments about smoking pot were just pandering of the worst kind. Even her father got angry with her!

Her dancing around the Jussie Smollett hoax was incredible.

As with Senator Obama in 2008, the media will fall in love with Senator Harris if she is on the ticket. Unlike 2008, President Trump is not Senator McCain and will challenge her and force her to make more mistakes on her feet.

News junkies had barely recovered from the media falsely labeling the Covington Catholic High School boys as racists. Then came the Smollett claims. Chicago residents survived the polar vortex only to be hit with a hoax hurricane.

Now the storm has passed (sort of). There’s still the court case and few thousand more think pieces, but journalists are eager to move on. (There’s also this laughable video of ABC’s Robin Roberts interviewing Smollett in a fictional scene on “Empire” where she asked him tougher questions than she did in real life.)

LAUREN DEBELLIS APPELL: ON SMOLLETT, COVINGTON AND KAVANAUGH, ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA JUDGE QUICKLY, APOLOGIZE SLOWLY

Journalists want to prove these two major national embarrassments don’t really indict the press. They’re right. They don’t. There are tons more. So here are six other examples of embarrassing journalist behavior from just this past week.

1. No Conservatives Allowed: Journalism is supposed to be neutral, but we know it’s not. This week CNN took a small step to improve its lineup by hiring former Trump administration staffer Sarah Isgur Flores as deputy political editor.

Journalists reacted like little boys banning a girl from their secret club. CNN staffers whined to the Daily Beast, calling the move “extremely demoralizing” and “very bizarre.”

The hire turned into a social media feeding frenzy. After mentioning “viewpoint diversity,” Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple tried to slam the clubhouse door right in her face. He bashed Flores and questioned “her about the contradictions in transitioning from an explicitly anti-media administration to its primary target, her history of sniping at the media and other stuff.”

Wemple, for the record, came to the Post after eight years as editor of the liberal Washington City Paper, which produced several major media lefties.

Wemple had plenty of help guarding that clubhouse door. Far-left Splinter News called Flores a “GOP hack.” Variety actually accused the network of the dread sin of trying to “bolster CNN’s ‘both sides now’ approach to the news.” Conservatives know that allegation to be ludicrous.

NBC News at least was honest enough to admit that some of the biggest names in news have come right off the Democrat bench. ABC hired President Clinton’s former adviser George Stephanopoulos, while Tim Russert was a top aide to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo before joining NBC News and becoming host of ‘Meet the Press.’”

2. Get Rid of Her, She’s Honest: I have the highest respect for foreign correspondents. They often go places alone where most of us would want the 82nd Airborne for company. One of the bravest has long been CBS’s Lara Logan.

Logan bombarded us with journalistic honesty this past week. Now we know why. According to Variety, Logan “is no longer with the network and has not been for several months.” Anyone who saw her interview with former Navy SEAL Mike Ritland’s podcast wouldn’t be surprised.

Logan blistered the traditional media as “mostly liberal” and bashed how some of today’s news is “absolute horse----.” She listed liberal outlets including, “CBS, ABC, NBC, Huffington Post, Politico.” Guaranteed to make her former CBS bosses thrilled.

Except almost no media outlets even mentioned what Logan had to say.

3. Stone Cold Mean: Roger Stone isn’t especially likable. The one-time Trump adviser (complete with Richard Nixon back tattoo) still has a right to better treatment than he has gotten at CNN. Senior Political Analyst David Gergen cautioned that Stone, who he said “is seen as something of a dandy,” is at risk for rape.

“Will he be physically safe? Will he be subject to rape?” Gergen asked. The Daily Caller noted that, “‘Dandy’ refers to a man who focuses intensely on physical appearance, but is also sometimes used as a gay slur.”

This wasn’t the first time CNN has talked about Stone suffering in prison. Anchor Jake Tapper commented that if Stone went to prison “he might like it.” CNN claimed he was referring to Stone’s desire for attention.

Stone wasn’t amused and who could blame him, telling the Daily Caller that “both Jake Tapper and David Gergen have salivated over the prospect that I could be raped in prison.” “These people are demons,” he said.

4. Blackface Smears USA Today Editor: The trifecta of Virginia Democratic scandals that are getting largely ignored by the media after an initial burst of attention spawned another embarrassment this past week. Only this was for USA Today. The paper went on a deep dive trying to find examples of archival racism in old yearbooks.

The paper played up its discoveries with huge front-page and inside coverage, “Review of 900 yearbooks finds blatant racism.” It certainly did. It showed that one of the racist yearbooks – the Arizona State University 1988-89 edition – was edited by none other than USA Today Editor-in-Chief Nicole Carroll.

Carroll wrote a column on the discovery, saying the yearbook “included a photo of two people at a Halloween party dressed as Mike Tyson and Robin Givens. It is horrible, and of course the photo should not have been published.”

The rest of the column mentioned appropriately liberal support for “the LGBTQ community and all marginalized groups.” But it included one key sentence that journalists should read: “We cannot cover America if we do not reflect America.”

She’s right. That should mean news outlets also hiring conservatives, Christians and more. But it seldom does.

5. ISIS Bride or Recruit? Hoda Muthana joined ISIS in 2014. Five years later, the former terrorist wants to enter the U.S. The Trump administration doesn’t want her back and the press is tugging on heartstrings to push her case.

One of the big challenges facing journalists is what to call her. “ISIS bride” is commonplace. It’s short and fits in headlines, but it also downplays what a monster she is. USA Today, NBC and lots of others used it. NPR (yes, I have now complimented NPR and CNN in this column) called her “Alabama Woman Who Joined ISIS.” It doesn’t roll off the tongue, but it’s accurate. Even lefty Vox called her an “ISIS recruit.”

It shows the importance of what even a small word choice can do.

6. Quote of the Week: Journalists love to mock the errors of people they don’t like. Here’s MSNBC anti-Trump Anchor Katy Tur getting a basic item wrong about American history. “You know, it is George Washington Day here in New York, unlike the rest of the country, because George Washington: native son of New York.”

Oops. Washington was born in Virginia. Yes, the same Virginia known as “The Mother of Presidents” – eight of them, including Washington. And Tur got that wrong on Presidents Day, of all days."

Recently, it was revealed that producers of Smollett’s Empire series would be cutting out his character, Jamal Lyon, for the final two episodes of season 5 with other rumors suggesting that Smollett will be recast altogether for season 6.

Notably, however, Smollett’s co-star and Empire star Terrence Howard is standing by his friend and coworker and took to Instagram to upload a clip of Smollett onboard a private jet with Howard while holding Howard’s baby boy, tickling the child and laughing with him in a warm moment. Attached to the clip is a caption that reads, “All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you.”

In the show, Howard takes on the role of Smollett’s TV father, Lucious Lyon, the fictional patriarch of music’s most influential family. While Jamal and Lucious have a particularly delicate relationship onscreen, it’s clear that Howard and Smollett’s camaraderie runs deep enough for Howard to support the 36-year-old despite such glaring accusations.

Currently, Smollett is out on a $100,000 bond after being charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report. He has since been ordered to surrender his passport."

Smollett plays Howard’s son, Jamal, on “Empire,” a Fox drama about a family dynasty set in the alluring world of hip-hop.

In a post on social media, Howard shared a video of a baby sitting on Smollett’s lap and breaking into fits of giggles when he tickles him.

“All your lil homies got you. We love the hell outta you,” he captioned the video along with a heart emoji.

Howard to fan: Not your job to judge

In one of the comments under the video, a fan criticized him for supporting Smollett, and Howard fired back with a lengthy message defending his decision.

“Sorry you feel that way but that’s the only Jussie I know,” he posted. “The Jussie I know could never even conceive of something so unconscious and ugly. His innocence or judgment is not for any of us to decide. Stay in your lane and my lane is empathy and love and compassion for someone I’ve called my son for five years. It’s God’s job to judge and it’s ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved.”

Smollett was arrested Thursday on a felony charge of disorderly conduct over falsely claiming he was attacked, Chicago police said

Authorities said Smollett was dissatisfied with his salary on the show and wanted publicity when he filed a police report saying two men attacked him and threw a noose around his neck on January 29 in Chicago.

He allegedly staged the attack by paying two brothers $3,500 to target him, police said. The men bought masks and a noose , and the actor directed them on what epithets to hurl when they attacked him, officials said.

Before the alleged attack, Smollett made sure the neighborhood had security cameras to ensure the assault would be recorded, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said Thursday.

“But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction,” he said.

Smollett reported the attack to police who investigated it as a possible hate crime. But as the story unfolded over the weeks, it started unraveling with twists and turns that culminated with his arrest on suspicion of filing a false police report.

‘Empire’ cast hasn’t said much since his arrest

The show’s main cast has not commented much since Smollett’s role in the attack changed from victim to suspect. But Howard expressed his shock when news of the alleged attack initially surfaced.

Smollett has maintained that he did not make up the story, and he has reiterated to the “Empire” cast and crew he was innocent of the charge against him.

His attorneys have said they plan to mount “an aggressive defense.”

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” his attorneys said in a statement.

Under Illinois law, filing a false police report is disorderly conduct and punishable by one to three years in prison. Smollett is due back in court March 14.

Executive producers of “Empire” said last week that while they were waiting for the legal process to play out, they would remove Smollett’s character from the season’s final two episodes."

The judge, John Fitzgerald Lyke of Cook County, who was also in charge of Jussie Smollett’s bail hearing, subsequently mentioned that the $1 million bail fee means that R Kelly will pay $250,000 each for his alleged four victims.

In two recent why-dunits, the curious have wondered why: (1) a successful TV star would allegedly orchestrate a fake, hate-inspired attack on himself, and (2) a Coast Guard officer would allegedly plot a mass-murder attack on American Democrats and journalists.

In the first instance, prosecutors say that actor Jussie Smollett last month paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack, tie a noose around his neck, douse him with bleach, and shout, “This is MAGA country!”

The actor, who is gay, and his alleged pretend-assailants, are all black. But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired – by Smollett.

If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged for disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a Ronald Reagan phrase that was commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag is in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed – at least by many in the pitchfork media – because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

Yet, a more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay – and in the name of Donald Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, last week, a California high-school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

On a far-more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested last week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people – and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion – it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, yet the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated three-decade military servicemember, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court yet never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grownups are so upset about it.

Days after Smollett was arrested on a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly filing a false police report, and then dropped from the final two episodes of Empire's season, Howard took to Instagram to express his support to his onscreen son.

""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you ♥️,"" Howard, who plays Lucious Lyon on the Fox series, wrote on Saturday. The video featured Smollett playing with the actor's son, Hero, while on a private plane.

""He's such a sweet baby,"" Smollett can be heard saying in the clip as the little one cozies up to him.

Taye Diggs appeared to support Howard's post, leaving the comment, ""Atta boy!"" Gabourey Sidibe also left three red hearts.

Instagram

On Friday, the executive producers of the Fox show released a new statement explaining their rationale for removing Smollett's role of Jamal from the remainder of the season. The statement comes one day after the actor turned himself in to authorities following his felony charge for disorderly conduct, for allegedly filing a false police report in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime on Jan. 29. He maintains his innocence.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" the statement reads. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement adds.

As ET previously reported, Smollett surrendered on Thursday. For allegedly filing a false police report, and if convicted, he faces up to three years in prison.

""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" Smollett's lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, told ET. ""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""

Empire star Terrence Howard has broken his silence to show support for his co-star, Jussie Smollett, who has been arrested and charged with ‘faking’ a brutal attack.

Smollett, 36, was released on $100,000 bail on Thursday after being charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report in January, claiming he had been beaten up by two men.

In a clear show of support, Terrence, who plays Lucious Lyon in the hit Fox series, shared a video of Smollett in the early hours of Sunday morning with the caption: ‘All your lil homies got you… We love the hell outta you .’

Smollett asks his co-star: ‘How many teeth does he have?’ before cooing: ‘Aw, he’s such a sweet baby.’ It’s not clear when the video was taken.

In the comments section, Smollett’s Empire co-star Gabourey Sidibe posted three heart emojis, despite removing her own Instagram message of support for the actor last week.

Terrence’s show of allegiance with Smollett comes as a surprise following reports that the Empire cast were keen to have the actor written out of the drama.

Immediately after posting bail, Smollett is said to have visited the Empire set to profess his ‘innocence’.

According to TMZ, the emotional TV star said emotionally: ‘I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.’

Chicago Police Department allege that Smollett ‘staged’ the whole attack (Picture: Getty Images)

Although he was expected to film that day, Smollett was sent home by producers as it was clear he had been crying.

Hours later, Empire showrunners announced that Smollett had been written out of the last two episodes of the current season. It’s said they are now ‘thinking of recasting’ his role as Jamal Lyon entirely.

Smollett is accused of filing a police report on 29 January, alleging that he had been attacked by two men at night in Chicago. The actor claims the men hurled racial and homophobic slurs and poured bleach on him.

Chicago Police Department say Smollett had ‘staged’ the whole attack.

He is due to appear in court on 16 March.

While on trial in 2008, R Kelly still found time to talk to fans, give autographs and to meet an underage girl he later invited to his home, according to prosecutors who depicted the R&B star as manipulative and sometimes violent.

Other accusers included a girl who met Kelly at her 16th birthday party and a hairdresser who expected to braid the singer's hair only to find that he wanted oral sex instead, court documents said.

The accounts emerged Saturday as Kelly made his first court appearance since being accused of sexually abusing four people in a case that could produce another #MeToo reckoning for a celebrity.

R Kelly was granted $1million bond in court on Saturday after having been indicted and booked on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse.

R Kelly was granted $1million bond in court on Saturday after having been indicted and booked on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse. The R&B singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is pictured in a booking photo released by the Chicago Police Department

Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr imposed a bond of $250,000 for each of the four women the embattled R&B singer, real name Robert Sylvester Kelly, is accused of abusing.

He will be able to post just 10 percent of the bond amount - $100,000 - to be released under the D-bond.

Kelly's lawyers had asked for a lower bond amount, arguing that the defendant's finances are a mess in part because he was recently dropped by his record label.

He also had to surrender his passport even though his attorney, Steve Greenberg, said Kelly is not a flight risk, telling the judge: 'Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn’t like to fly.'

Bond was set after prosecutors laid out the stunning allegations against Kelly in graphic detail. Three of the four cases involved women who were underage.

Kelly reported kept his eyes locked on the courtroom floor and looked dejected as Judge Lyke Jr called the allegations 'disturbing'.

Kelly has been accused of sexually abusing four victims, at least three who were under the age of 17 at the time. The singer (above in a court sketch from Saturday) reportedly kept his eyes locked on the courtroom floor and looked dejected as Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr called the allegations against him 'disturbing'

Cook County state's attorney Kimberly Foxx spoke to the press outside the courtroom following Kelly's bond hearing and provided more details about the charges brought against the singer, which the presiding judge called 'disturbing'

After the hearing, Cook County state's attorney Kimberly Foxx addressed the press and provided additional details on each of the indictments.

The first victim, identified as H.W., allegedly met Kelly when she was celebrating her 16th birthday and his manager gave her the artist's card.

The victim's mother approached the manager and informed him that the girl was only 16. The girl later took the card out of her mother's purse and contacted Kelly, who told her to skip school and come to his studio, Foxx said.

The pair allegedly had regular sexual contact including oral and vaginal intercourse about once a month between May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999. Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

The second indictment is based on a disturbing video purportedly showing Kelly have sex with a 14-year-old girl identified as R.L., in an incident that took place between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001.

That incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

The allegations came to light in 2001 when a witness having a conversation with Kelly and his associates was asked to retrieve video showing the artist having sexual intercourse with the victim. The witness turned the video over to police.

The third indictment with one count of aggravated sexual assault involved a 24-year-old hairdresser, identified as L.W., who was hired to braid Kelly's hair.

Prosecutors say that on February 18, 2003, Kelly told the woman that he didn't want her to braid his hair but wanted a head massage as he exposed his penis to her.

He then allegedly grabbed her head and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him.

When she resisted, Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face several times, prosecutors said. Kelly's DNA was recovered from the alleged victim's shirt.

The fourth victim, identified as J.P., met Kelly when she asked for his autograph while attending his 2008 trial on child pornography charges.

According to an indictment detailing three counts of aggravated sexual assault, the pair engaged in oral and vaginal sex between a period from May 2009 to January 2010. She was between 13 and 17 at the time.

Prosecutors say Kelly would often spit on the victim, slap her in the face, choke her and ejaculate on her. She saved a shirt from one of the incidents and turned it over to police, who found a DNA match to Kelly.

If convicted on all 10 counts, Kelly could face up to 70 years behind bars. His arraignment has been scheduled for February 28.

Kelly surrendered to police in Chicago on Friday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest

Kelly arrived in a black van at the 1st District Chicago police station around 8pm CST. The singer did not respond as reporters shouted questions at him

Kelly was led inside the station, handcuffed by police, and led away for booking

Kelly surrendered on Friday night at the 1st District Chicago police station, hours after the Cook County State's Attorney office issued a no bail warrant for his arrest.

In a booking photo released by the Chicago Police Department early Saturday, Kelly can be seen wearing a basic black hooded sweatshirt and an exhausted expression.

Kelly arrived at the station in a large black van with tinted windows at around 8pm CST. He exited the vehicle wearing a puffy blue coat, entered the station house, was handcuffed and led away.

The 52-year-old did not respond as reporters shouted questions, including: 'Are you innocent?' and 'How do you explain the video?'

In response to a question about what he had to say 'to the black women of Chicago,' Kelly's attorney shot back: 'That's an offensive question.'

Following Kelly's arrest, his attorney Steve Greenberg addressed reporters outside the station.

He said that several of the charges are 'double jeopardy' because they 'involve the same girl' that Kelly was acquitted of producing child pornography with in 2008.

Greenberg went on to say that all of the accusations against Kelly, including those in the recent documentary Surviving R Kelly, are false.

'I think all the women are lying, yes. This has become: ""Hey I can say R Kelly did something."" Boom,' the lawyer said. '""Oh I met R Kelly once, he looked at me the wrong way."" Boom, money.'

Greenberg also blasted celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti, who said last week that he had turned over to prosecutors damning video evidence of Kelly performing sex acts on a 14-year-old girl.

'I haven't seen Avenatti's tape,' Greenberg said. 'I wonder why [prosecutor] Kim Foxx isn't investigating him for disseminating child porn and watching child porn, which I'm sure he's done many times.'

Avenatti blasted back minutes later on Twitter: 'Steve Greenberg is exactly what R Kelly deserves. Happy to be living rent free in this guy's head.'

R KELLY INDICTMENTS Robert Sylvester Kelly, 52, was indicted on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims on Friday, February 22 in Chicago. VICTIM 1 - H.W., 16 years old Regular sexual contact between May 1998 to May 1999

Four counts of aggravated sexual assault Kelly allegedly met H.W. when she was celebrating her 16th birthday and his manager gave her the artist's card, according to Cook County state attorney Kimberly Foxx. The victim's mother approached the manager and informed him that the girl was only 16. The girl later took the card out of her mother's purse and contacted Kelly, who told her to skip school and come to his studio, Foxx said. The pair allegedly had regular sexual contact including oral and vaginal intercourse about once a month between May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999. VICTIM 2 - R.L., 14 years old Once incident between September 1998 to September 2001

Two counts of aggravated sexual assault The second indictment is based on a disturbing video purportedly showing Kelly have sex with a 14-year-old girl identified as R.L., in an incident that allegedly took place between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001. The allegations came to light in 2001 when a witness having a conversation with Kelly and his associates was asked to retrieve video showing the artist having sexual intercourse with the victim, Foxx said. The witness turned the video over to police. VICTIM 3 - L.W., 24 years old One incident on February 18, 2003

One count of aggravated sexual assault Prosecutors say L.W. had been hired to braid Kelly's hair on February 18, 2003, and when the singer showed up for his appointment he allegedly told the 24-year-old that he didn't want her to braid his hair but wanted a head massage as he exposed his penis to her. He then allegedly grabbed her head and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. When she resisted, Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face several times, prosecutors said. Kelly's DNA was recovered from the victim's shirt. VICTIM 4 - J.P., under 17 years old Repeated sexual contact between May 2009 and January 2010

Three counts of aggravated sexual assault J.P. allegedly met Kelly when she asked for his autograph while attending his 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges. According to an indictment detailing three counts of aggravated sexual assault, the pair engaged in oral and vaginal sex between a period from May 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010. Kelly allegedly spat on the victim, slapped her in the face and ejaculated on her. The victim brought a T-shirt with his semen on it when she reported the alleged abuse to police. If convicted on all 10 counts, Kelly could face up to 70 years behind bars. His arraignment has been scheduled for February 28. R Kelly has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. Advertisement

Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg denied the charges against his client after he turned himself in on Friday night. Greenberg told reporters that 'all the women are lying'

Upon news of his arrest, some of Kelly's accusers spoke out to express their gratitude.

'When I first heard the news, I started crying because it was tears of joy,' Asante McGee told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

She appeared in the Surviving R Kelly docuseries, in which she accused the singer of holding her in a Georgia home and abusing her six years ago - allegations that are unrelated to the criminal charges Kelly faces in Chicago.

'To know that we finally got an indictment after two decades, after him getting away with the allegations, it was a joyous moment for me,' McGee said. 'Just knowing the things that he was doing to those young girls was really sickening.'

In a statement, Kelly's attorney said the singer is 'shell-shocked' by the sex abuse charges.

Kelly has previously denied all allegations of assault and abuse through his lawyer.

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of three to seven years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

Back to court: R Kelly (above at his 2008 trial) has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse by the Cook County State's Attorney's office

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

This comes just one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report in a suspected hate hoax.

The same judge overseeing that case, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, has been assigned to Kelly's case.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

The alleged rape tape was submitted to the State's Attorney's Office last week by Michael Avenatti.

At the time, Avenatti said that he believed it showed Kelly and an underage minor whose age he guessed to be 14.

CNN then watched the tape as well, despite the fact that it is a federal crime to watch child pornography.

When asked if either party might be investigated for these actions, an FBI spokesperson declined to comment.

R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving several victims including minors. He is seen above performing in 2016

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.

Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday.

His manager however found himself in trouble with the law days after the series premired.

A police report filed in Georgia reveals that Don Russell texted and called Timothy Savage, the father of one of the alleged victims, to say it 'would be best for him and his family if the documentary does not air.'

Russell later said that he and Kelly might have to release information that would destroy Savage, his family and his business.

Savage and his wife Jonelyn have been trying for years to get back their daughter Jocelyn, who ran off to be with Kelly shortly after meeting him backstage at a concert when she was only 17.

They believe that she is being held captive but the singer, but both Kelly and Jocelyn deny this is the case.

The report states that Savage called police shortly after 5am on the day of the incident.

The responding officer then arrived at the house before 5.45am, which is when Russell called Savage on the phone.

Savage was then able to put the phone on speaker so that the officer could hear everything that was being said by Russell.

'Don says several times that Timothy is providing Lifetime with false information, and that is he continues supporting the documentary that they (R Kelly / Don) would be forced to release information disproving Don,' reads the report.

'Don advised Timothy that the information would ruin him, his reputation, business and family, because it would show him a liar.'

This is actually the second time one of the singer's managers has threatened Savage, who previously filed a police report against James Mason.

There is now an outstanding warrant for Mason after he failed to respond to police when they asked to question him about the 'threats' he made to Savage.

The Savages first spoke out in an interview with BuzzFeed on in 2017 which contained worrying allegations that Kelly had been holding a handful of young women in cult like conditions and effectively treating them as his sexual slaves for years.

Some former members of his entourage vouched for their concern. Three separate women said they were all forced to subscribe to his rules.

They said they were told when to eat, bathe, sleep and had to perform sexual acts on one another which the singer then recorded.

Savage's mother recalled painstakingly how she was present when her daughter met the singer as an aspiring musician herself after being invited backstage to a concert in 2015.

It's not clear exactly when Jocelyn went to live with Kelly but her family say they have not seen her since December 2017. 'It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,' her mother said.

The mother-of-three boasted about meeting the star again in January 2016. On Facebook, she posed with Jocelyn and the star along with one other women, telling friends how they were 'in the studio'.

In her BuzzFeed interview, she said she thought it would be 'fine' for her daughter to spend time with the star if she was there to watch over her.

Jocelyn's father Timothy believes she is suffering Stockholm Syndrome, a condition which sees hostages grow to love their captors.

The family contacted police after their daughter fled to live with the singer and told officers how he was running a 'cult'.

Police visited the home where they said she was but it was empty. They then tracked her down in Chicago but she said she was fine and wanted to be left alone by her family.

Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee - all former members of Kelly's entourage - described in detail the sort of treatment endured by young women who find themselves pulled into the singer's orbit.

A representative for Kelly spoke out at the time about the claims, saying the singer 'unequivocally denies' them and said he will 'work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and to clear his name'.

Earlier, Mack, Jones, and McGee said there are at least six women living in properties rented by the R&B star in Chicago and Atlanta. The 'guest houses' where the women are kept are near his home in suburban Atlanta, and his apartment at Trump Tower in Chicago.

'You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom… [Kelly] is a master at mind control... He is a puppet master,' Mack, who worked as the singer's assistant, told the website.

The women, who said the 'babies' - as the girls are referred to - are required to call Kelly 'Daddy', then ran through a list of people they believe were living either at one of the performer's properties in Atlanta or his Chicago recording studio last summer.

The first woman mentioned in the article was a 31-year-old 'den mother', who is reportedly responsible for 'training newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually'.

The 'den mother' 'had been best friends since high school' with the person who was allegedly in the videotape that led to Kelly standing trial on child pornography charges in 2008.

Mack said many of the young women are sucked in by the singer because they think: 'This is R Kelly, I'm going to live a lavish lifestyle'.

In addition to the aforementioned control Kelly has, he allegedly demands the women ask his permission before leaving a room, are forced to wear jogging suits in public in order to keep their figures hidden, have their phones taken and are given new ones that are only allowed to be used to contact him or others approved by him, and have to deal with a 'burly' SUV driver parked outside his properties.

Both Mack and Jones said that if any of the women break the 'rules', Kelly 'punishes them physically and verbally'. Jones recounted a time she angered Kelly by 'being too friendly' with the male cashier.

'I got trapped. I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I'm talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls,' said Jones.

McGee added: 'R Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet. But Robert is the devil.'"

Hate crimes are real. Just ask state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith.

Chicago’s police chief is accusing “Empire” star Jussie Smollett of using the “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career” by paying two men to stage an attack on him last month.

The allegations concerning Smollett, who is black and gay, sparked an international avalanche of commentary and ignited concerns that reports of the bogus attack could have a chilling effect on victims of hate-related violence.

Smith, an Orlando Democrat who is gay, is turning the controversy into a teachable moment, by sharing his own experience as the survivor of an assault.

While a student at the University of Central Florida, Smith and his friend, Heath Frank, were beaten up at a keg party by a man who repeatedly called his two victims “faggots” after he was arrested, according to a police report.

“I decided to finally tell this very deeply personal story because the reality is that hate crimes are real. Homophobia is real. Bigotry is real. And hate violence is on the rise against many groups. Anti-Semitism is on the rise. Hate violence against transgender women of color is on the rise, especially in Florida,” Smith said in a telephone interview.

Smith took to Twitter on Thursday about his experience as a survivor of “senseless hate violence,” posting a picture of his battered face and a police report of the incident.

The attacker, identified as Eduardo Alessandro Mongio in court documents provided by Smith, was “lingering around” and “acting kind of weird” at a crowded keg party, Smith said.

After beating up Frank, the attacker confronted Smith.

“I didn’t know what was going on. But I got banged up pretty bad. When the dust settled, everyone was telling me about how the guy was making all these homophobic slurs about our group, because hey, listen, we travel in cliques. We queer people, we stick together,” Smith said. “I don’t remember if the guy was drunk or what his deal was, but he started lashing out. It was like a full-fledged gay-bashing.”

Smith said he “felt compelled to speak out” as the controversy around Smollett exploded.

“I don’t know what the outcome is going to become of the Jussie Smollett case. But I can already see there’s a narrative out there that hate crimes aren’t real. No. They are. And they’re on the rise. Especially with the election of Donald Trump, who wears hate for other groups on his sleeve,” he said.

SMOKE ‘EM IF YOU GOT ‘EM

Measures that would allow patients to smoke medical marijuana are headed to the House and Senate floors as legislative leaders iron out differences in their plans.

Lawmakers moved closer to agreement Thursday, after the House Appropriations Committee eliminated a proposal that would have restricted medical marijuana dispensaries to selling pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes with filters.

After making the change, the committee approved the House version of the smokable-marijuana bill (HB 7015). But unlike the Senate’s bill, the House version would not allow dispensaries to sell other whole-flower products.

The Senate proposal (SB 182) would require medical marijuana operators to sell at least one type of pre-rolled, filterless cigarette and allow them to sell other whole-flower products. It also would let patients buy equipment to smoke cannabis products from other retail outlets, such as smoke shops.

The House plan would ban children from smoking, while the Senate measure would allow minors to smoke medical marijuana if patients get a second opinion from a pediatrician.

Both proposals are ready for floor votes after the annual legislative session starts March 5.

Shortly after he was sworn into office last month, Gov. Ron DeSantis gave lawmakers until March 15 to address the smoking issue. If they don’t act, the Republican governor threatened to drop the state’s appeal of a court ruling that said the ban violates a voter-approved constitutional amendment broadly legalizing medical marijuana.

Leaders in both chambers remained confident they would finalize a deal in time to meet the governor’s deadline.

“At each committee stop, I believe the two chambers have moved closer. I think by the time we put the bills on the floor, we will have them aligned,” House sponsor Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, told reporters after Thursday’s meeting.

Rodrigues said he expects the full House to vote on the proposal by the end of the first week of session.

Whether patients under age 18 should be allowed to smoke remains the biggest sticking point for the House, according to Rodrigues.

“We don’t believe children should be smoking medical marijuana,” he said.

The Senate’s biggest issue, meanwhile, is allowing patients to access whole-flower products other than pre-rolled joints.

Rep. Ralph Massullo, a Lecanto Republican who is a dermatologist, pointed out that marijuana is still a Schedule 1 drug under federal law and that a paucity of research exists related to smoking cannabis as a treatment.

By allowing smoking as a route of administration, “we’re basically letting the tail wag the dog,” he warned.

But, said Massullo, “It’s solving problems, and that’s what we need to do.”

“CHOICE” EDUCATION PLANS

Top Senate Republicans on Thursday released details of a package that would bring significant changes to the state’s education system, most notably through an expansion of school choice.

The package would expand private school options for students, bolster security measures in schools and overhaul a program for teacher bonuses.

The series of proposals, which will be filed next week, are aligned with what DeSantis has proposed, including a pitch for a new voucher-type program funded directly with public money rather than through a system that involves corporate tax credits.

The Senate and the Republican governor want to create the voucher program to help reduce a waiting list of roughly 14,000 low-income students in the existing Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program. In that program, corporations receive tax credits for contributions to non-profit organizations, which, in turn, pay for children to go to private schools.

Senate Education Chairman Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said the eligibility requirements between the Senate and the governor’s proposals for the new program are “very similar.” But details will have to be worked out during the legislative session.

“My plan is to provide relief for these kids who are on a waitlist and those parents who want to provide a better education for their child,” Diaz said. “We start with the premise that every child is different … and what works for one child may not work for another.”

Senate Democrats slammed the package for putting taxpayer dollars into a voucher program that benefits private schools.

“The latest move is not only an abandonment of the traditional public-school system in Florida but an abandonment of the constitutional obligation to fully fund a ‘high quality system of free public schools’ that has been built over generations by the people, for the people,” said Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville.

STORY OF THE WEEK: The House and Senate are getting closer to agreement on a plan that would allow patients to smoke medical marijuana, a priority of Gov. Ron DeSantis.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “We really don’t know what we’re doing.” — Rep. Ralph Massullo, a dermatologist, referring to a lack of scientific research about the effects of smoking medical marijuana on patients.

The report says the brothers made a deal with Jussie to train him for five weeks so he could get in shape for an upcoming music video. Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a 5-week nutrition plan - but no specific amount was discussed as payment.

The report adds that a few days before the widely reported planned attack, Jussie wrote the brothers a check for $3,500. The memo line read, ""5 weeks training nutrition plan."" And so, Ola and Abel were paid for the 5-week program and not for the attack.

Also, the brothers felt the amount was ""a little high"" but no one ever specifically said anything about any of the money being part of a scheme."

But from the moment Jupiter, Florida, police identified the New England Patriots owner as part of a sting operation investigating possible human trafficking, it was apparent that Kraft’s mere presence in the matter is already responsible for staining the NFL’s so-called “shield.”

Nearly three weeks ago, Kraft basked in the glory of yet another Super Bowl crown for the Patriots. Last weekend, he rolled with the ballers and rappers during NBA All-Star Weekend.

Now he’s the biggest name to be released so far by police, who declared Friday that they have video evidence that proves the Patriots owner, 77, twice paid for sexual acts.

No, it’s not good for the brand when the owner of the NFL’s most successful organization of this era attracts such scandalous attention, lining up in the news cycle on Friday – and likely for weeks beyond – with the likes of Jussie Smollett, R. Kelly and his Oval Office pal, President Donald Trump.

Say it ain’t so, Bob.

Sure, Kraft is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We’ll see if the charges – which in addition to fines carry a maximum of 60 days in jail for a first offense, one year for a second offense – hold up in court.

Yet Kraft’s stellar reputation, linked to the image-conscious sports league that is more popular than any, instantly took a significant blow that threatens to become part of his legacy.

A spokesman for Kraft quickly responded as such: “We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we are not commenting further.”

And there’s this statement from league headquarters: “The NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.”

KRAFT:What we know about Patriots owner's prostitution solicitation charges

Let’s remember, when it comes to NFL matters, there are two courts of law to consider: The jurisprudence of the land and Roger Goodell’s court.

The two are supposedly mutually exclusive, yet they're intertwined in the reality that Goodell’s credibility – with damage already inflicted on the league’s reputation – suddenly faces another challenge in how he handles the case of one of the NFL’s most respected power brokers and one of his biggest personal supporters.

This is why the commissioner gets paid the big bucks: Protect the shield.

Goodell did some splendid dancing on behalf of his bosses, the NFL owners, when it came to repeatedly defending the league in the recently settled collusion case stemming from the apparent blackballing of Colin Kaepernick.

KAEPERNICK:Justice won’t be done until he’s on a roster

Alternatively, Goodell dropped the hammer on Jim Irsay in 2014, suspending him for six games and fining him the maximum amount of $500,000 after the Indianapolis Colts owner pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was found to possess controlled substances.

And he stood his ground against Kraft and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the Deflategate case. Ordered an investigation into the workplace misconduct allegations that led to then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson quickly selling the franchise. Went toe-to-toe with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in suspending Ezekiel Elliott for violating the conduct policy amid domestic violence allegations against the running back.

So, Goodell’s track record on personal conduct matters – as a number of current and former players will attest – suggests that he’ll take action against Kraft. Yet if he does, the key will be the swiftness and substance of any such move.

The NFL’s personal conduct policy clearly states this much: ""Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline when violations of the Personal Conduct Policy occur.""

Now Goodell can define those words in real time.

Kraft deserves his due process but not a double standard. In fact, as the NFL’s conduct policy states, he deserves to be subject to a higher standard.

Can Kraft be placed on some version of the “commissioner’s exempt list” and removed from day-to-day involvement with the Patriots and NFL while he tries to legally clear his name?

That would represent a strong statement from Goodell. After all, with the charges against Kraft coming from the law enforcement community the NFL embraces, this is not a he-said, she-said civil suit.

Yet I wonder if Kraft’s immense collateral equity, if you will, will play a role in how Goodell responds.

Multiple reports said that Kraft, after all, urged Trump to help seal the deal that allowed Canadian broadcasters to sell their own Super Bowl ads, which the NFL pursued for years to no avail. He was also the NFL owner who probably had the biggest influence in striking the labor deal in 2011 that ended the lockout, while his wife, Myra, was in the final stages of battling the ovarian cancer that took her life. And when pondering the impact of a community-minded team like the Patriots, Kraft is some kind of legend – the former season-ticket holder who saved the franchise from moving from the region, the whiz who hired Bill Belichick.

Kraft’s narrative, though, has suddenly expanded in the worst way – as something fresh to come across Goodell’s desk, something suddenly attached to the sports environment and a legal matter to boot.

It was strange to see a professional talking head on ESPN state at least a half-dozen times in a matter of minutes Friday how “uncomfortable” it was to discuss Kraft in this vein.

That’s like the “we never imagined it could happen here” soundbites you hear when tragedy strikes in particular neighborhoods. Unfortunately, sports and society are interwoven. There have been so many examples of NFL figures – in many cases, players – being involved in all sorts of off-the-field issues for which the talking heads don’t use “uncomfortable” to preface the analysis.

Something happened. Kraft is on full blast, like players, coaches and all sorts of public figures. It’s the world we live in. Unfortunate, but not “uncomfortable” to ponder that.

How about the comforting thought that Kraft needs to be held to a higher standard – and maybe for his own good, too.

This year’s best picture nominees make for quite a diverse lineup, with a superhero movie, several biopics, a musical romance, a quirky historical comedy, and a black-and-white family drama among others.

Which of them will take home the best picture title? It’s a tight race but when it comes to reviews, some have an edge over others. These are what the critics have said:

Black Panther

Director Ryan Coogler took Hollywood by storm with his take on Marvel's Black Panther, a visually stunning film about a mythical, hidden, technologically advanced African kingdom called Wakanda.

The film is centered on the title character, T'Challa, the heir to Wakanda's throne who takes over as king when his father is assassinated. He is challenged by Killmonger, a US black ops soldier with nefarious intentions who also happens to be T'Challa's cousin.

The film earned an impressive 7 nominations overall, and made history by becoming the first comic book film to win a best picture nomination. It won top honors at the Screen Actors Guild awards for best ensemble cast.

It was generally loved by critics, who say that it brought the superhero genre to the next level by bringing a fresh new voice to the genre’s formula.

Christopher Orr in his review in The Atlantic said Black Panther is more than just a superhero movie, praising the film’s visuals, production and costume design, and the fight scenes, which he describes as “better than usual.” He also praised Michael B Jordan’s turn as the “vicious yet relatable” villain, and the fact that many of the film’s central characters are women. “This is a film that does not merely pass the Bechtel test, it demolishes it,” he wrote.

Oggz Cruz likewise raved about the film in his review for Rappler, calling it “a rare animal in a jungle full of loud but fleeting blockbusters.” He praised the way the film “takes its sweet time to carve culture, even if it is all fictional,” and said that the film on the whole is more profound than other superhero flicks.

He said that the film is fun and entertaining, and, with its Stan Lee cameo and end credits scene is still very much a Marvel movie. “Coogler however blends much-needed imperative character and overt discourse to all the otherwise routine and colorless fun,” he added.

BlacKkKlansman

In BlacKkKlansman, veteran director Spike Lee turned out a blistering drama based on the real-life tale of a black cop in Colorado who decides to try to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan with the help of his white partner.

The film – which earned 6 nominations – stars John David Washington (son of two-time Oscar winner Denzel) as Ron Stalwart and Oscar nominee Adam Driver as his partner Flip Zimmerman.

BlacKkKlansman unfolds in the 1970s, but the film ends with images of rallies in Charlottesville two years ago, becoming a searing indictment of divisions in today's America.

The film was hailed by critics, including Mark Kermode who said in his review for The Guardian that the film was Lee’s best work since his 1997 documentary 4 Little Girls. He praised Washington’s performance, calling it “wonderfully wry and nuanced,” as well as the cinematography of Chayse Irvin and the “note perfect” production and costume design.

“What’s most remarkable is how well Lee balances the tonal shifts, provoking both laughs and gasps with a film built upon dualities: fact and fiction (Stallworth’s story is heavily fictionalized, yet rings “true”); past and present; inside and outside,” he said.

Reviewing for Empire, Helen O’Hara also noted the film’s swaying tone, which she said might not be appreciated by everybody. “But for the most part, the moments of levity serve to keep the bleakness at bay,” she said.

She praised the film and noted its significance in Lee’s larger body of work. “This is vital and timely work that’s up there with [Lee’s] best, with a gut-wrenching sting in the tail,” she wrote.

Bohemian Rhapsody

The biopic about legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury earned a total of 5 nominations, with star Rami Malek a top contender for best actor for his portrayal of Mercury. The film also took home wins at the Golden Globes, but it did not escape scandal. It was directed by Bryan Singer, who is facing a raft of sexual misconduct allegations, some of them involving teenage boys.

Singer was fired shortly before Bohemian Rhapsody wrapped, and has not been involved or even mentioned during the film's awards season campaigns. But his name remains in the movie's credits.

At any rate, the film has been met with mixed reviews, though Malek’s performance was met with praise for the most part. In fact, for Roger Ebert, it was about the only part of the film that merited praise.

“The single star of this review is for Malek's performance,” he said, commending the way Malek “tapped into Mercury’s ferocious energy,” even as he criticized the film’s narrative and, more pointedly, its attitude towards Mercury’s sexuality.

""Bohemian Rhapsody is bad in the way a lot of biopics are bad: it's superficial, it avoids complexity, and the narrative has a connect-the-dots quality. This kind of badness, while annoying, is relatively benign. However, the attitude towards Mercury's sexual expression is the opposite of benign,” he wrote.

Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, also shared the opinion that the film is bad, but acknowledged that it is “giddily entertaining” and that it “succeeds simply on the level of pure inexplicable pleasure.”

She goes on to sing praises for Malek’s performance, and said that the final scene is among “the most memorable movie finales in recent memory.”

“Bohemian Rhapsody might have started out as an ode to the supernatural talent of one man. It ends as a testament to a band, and simply how good they made their fans feel,” she said.

The Favourite

A film with a decidedly female perspective has not won best picture since Million Dollar Baby in 2005 and The Favourite would be a welcome way to break that streak.

Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos hired a trio of powerhouse actresses – Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone – to bring to life his feminist reimagining of the life and reign of Britain's Queen Anne.

Colman plays the ailing, paranoid monarch, while Weisz plays her best friend, advisor and (in the film) lover Lady Sarah, and Stone appears as Abigail, Sarah's distant cousin looking to move up at court.

What ensues is a dark, farcical yet affecting look at a queen in turmoil, who falls victim to her scheming female companions. It earned 10 nominations, tying with Roma, and all 3 women got Oscar nods.

Rappler’s Cruz called the film “outrageously fun and funny,” commending its clever screenplay and the way it pokes fun at royal extravagance in a hilarious way.

“The Favourite, while draped in the predictable extravagance of a costume drama, never sees the need to suffocate itself with rituals and formalities. The film thrives in finding faults in what supposedly are considered as bastions of etiquette and civility,” he wrote.

David Edelstein writing for Vulture said that while the film is “mostly twaddle as history,” it’s “wonderful, nasty fun,” anchored by the strong performance of its 3 central actresses, calling Colman in particular “astonishing.” He also sang praises for the film’s tight script and its pace, saying “Lanthimos should always work at tempos this brisk.”

Green Book

Can a classical black pianist and a rough-and-ready Italian-American bouncer-turned-driver become friends in the 1960s as they travel through the segregated Deep South? Green Book says yes.

The civil rights dramedy, based on the real-life experiences of musician Don Shirley and Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga, is running behind Roma in most Oscar predictions for best picture honors.

The movie – which explores race relations and questions about identity – soars thanks to its lead actors Viggo Mortensen (Vallelonga) and Mahershala Ali (Shirley), who are both Oscar nominees. In total, the film counts 5 nominations, including best screenplay, and best film editing.

It endured its fair share of criticism and controversy, including over whether it is the latest in a stream of ""white savior"" movies, but the stars and the film's team have vigorously defended it.

Lawrence Ware in the New York Times hailed Mortensen’s and Ali’s performances, and said that Vallelonga’s transformation throughout the film is convincing. However, he said that the way the film portrays race is “simplistic,” and calls out its decision to tell the story through a white perspective. He is particularly troubled by a scene that seems to gloss over Shirley’s sexuality, saying that it is especially problematic – referencing the attack on Jussie Smollett (the review was written before Smollet was alleged to have orchestrated the attack himself).

“The screenplay essentially turns Shirley into a black man who thematically shapeshifts into whoever will make the story appealing to white audiences — and that’s inexcusable,” he wrote.

Orr for The Atlantic was also of the opinion that the film was simplistic in its attempts to talk about race, saying that it doesn’t offer much in terms of meaningful commentary. But he said that the performances of Mortensen and Ali save the film.

“First-rate execution can’t solve all of a film’s problems, but Mortensen and Ali offer a reminder that it can solve an awful lot of them,” he said.

Roma

Alfonso Cuaron's love letter to his childhood – and the 2 women who guided him, his mother and his nanny – has been the overwhelming favorite to win the top prize on February 24. If it does win, it will be the first foreign-language film to do so, and the first best picture winner for streaming giant Netflix.

Roma tells the story of an indigenous woman named Cleo – played by first-time actress Yalitza Aparicio – who works as a housekeeper and nanny for a middle-class family in Mexico City during the 1970s.

The movie, shot in a mixture of Spanish and the indigenous Mixtec language, is a personal triumph for Cuaron, already an Oscar winner for best director in 2014 for space epic Gravity.

In his review for Rappler, Cruz called Roma “that perfectly molded loving tribute to the people in the fringes,” and applauded the way it portrays the lead character realistically, and not in a glamorized or romanticized way. He also praises the way the film intimately explores its themes.

Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called it “the best movie of the year,” and “Cuaron’s masterpiece.” He praised the way the director used the film’s visuals, sound design, and cinematography in his storytelling, and likewise commended the character of Cleo – and Aparicio’s portrayal of her.

“Like the film itself, Cleo never begs for sympathy. Trust us: your tears will come nonetheless.” he said.

A Star Is Born

At the start of Hollywood's awards season, A Star Is Born looked like the natural leading contender.

The retelling of a classic Tinseltown tale – an addicted singer on the wane, a young ingenue on the rise and their doomed love affair in the balance – had Oscars gold written all over it. It had mega-star power in actor-director Bradley Cooper and co-star Lady Gaga. It enjoyed massive success at the box office. Critics loved it. So what happened?

Despite earning 8 nominations, Oscarologists see the film as a lock for best original song (""Shallow"") but not for much else.

When it comes to the reviews, however, the film is generally well-liked.

In his review on Rappler, Cruz commended the film’s cinematography and applauded it’s authenticity. In particular, he sang praises for the performances by the two leads, which he described as “riveting.”

“Cooper evolves the heartbreaking but overly familiar tale and turns it into a fascinating glimpse into yearning lives eventually broken by an industry that thrives in ease and appearances,” he said.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5/4 stars, praising the way the film breathes new life into a story that’s been told many times over. He lauded Cooper’s and Gaga’s performances, Cooper’s direction, and the film’s “heart-baring music.”

“Cynics may be tempted to rip apart A Star is Born but there’s just too much that’s been done right here for them to sound legit,” he said.

Vice

Adam McKay brought his offbeat sense of satire to the life of former US vice president Dick Cheney for Vice, charting the rise of George W. Bush's veep from Montana to the West Wing.

Christian Bale earned widespread praise for disappearing under extra pounds and a mountain of make-up into the role – and earned a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his efforts.

Bale, along with co-stars Amy Adams (Cheney's wife Lynne) and Sam Rockwell (Bush), received Oscar nominations, but the film's mixed reviews stalled its awards campaign for the bigger prizes.

Most critics were impressed by Bale’s performance.

Owen Gleiberman in a review for Variety described the film as “brashly entertaining but not, in the end, as rich or deep as you want it to be,” though he commended Bale’s portrayal of Cheney, calling it an impersonation “on a virtuoso level of observation and exactitude.”

In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw similarly praised Bale’s Cheney, calling his performance “a terrifically and in fact rather scarily plausible impersonation.” The film itself he described as “a kind of PowerPoint biopic, a Ted talk of a comedy, with fourth-wall breaks and voiceover routines borrowed from Michael Moore.”

The film’s style, he said, is reminiscent of McKay’s earlier and “bafflingly overrated” work, The Big Short, but ultimately concluded that Vice is better, “because of a big, enjoyable, intelligent central performance in which Bale has the sense to do more with less.”

Which of the 8 films are you raring to see? And which one gets your best picture vote?

I warned from the first day that the supposed attack on Jussie Smollett by “white racists” was a scam and hoax.

Police say ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett turned himself in on Thursday, Feb. 21, 2019, to face a charge of making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men. (Chicago Police Department via AP)

Why did everyone miss it? All the signs were there. Anyone who wasn’t biased, prejudiced, blind, deaf or dumb should have seen this coming a mile away.

I did. I was the first national pundit to stick his neck out and risk anger, shame and ridicule, not to mention the dreaded “racist”label. I warned from the first day that the supposed attack on Jussie Smollett by “white racists” was a scam and hoax.

Go back to my Twitter feed on Jan. 30 — the first day the attack on the black, gay actor-singer was publicized in the media. I was certain it never happened for a variety of reasons.

First, from the start, it sounded like a ridiculous, laughable fantasy that could only happen in a liberal’s wildest dream. I’ve never heard of white men wandering the streets of inner city neighborhoods at 2 a.m. wearing red Trump hats, holding a noose, looking to lynch black men. The story was absurd.

Second, I called buddy from Chicago who happens to be black to ask about the neighborhood. His exact quote: “It never happened, because there are no white dudes at 2 a.m. in that neighborhood. Those streets are dangerous. There aren’t two white guys with Trump hats on that corner at 2 p.m., let alone 2 a.m.”

Third, real racism existed in this country. There were lynchings. It’s a terrible part of our history. But today? In Chicago? Sorry, but white Trump voters don’t lynch blacks in Alabama anymore, let alone on the mean streets of Chicago at 2 a.m.

Fourth, it was 2 a.m. on one of the coldest nights in Chicago’s history. It was 20 degrees below zero. Who is out roaming the streets to lynch someone when it’s 20 below zero? Ludicrous.

Here’s the fifth tipoff and clincher: Smollett claimed the white racists instantly recognized him. They called his name. They said he was the “n-word” from “Empire.” Really? At 2 a.m. in the pitch dark, these two white thugs recognized a small-time TV actor?

I’d never heard Smollett’s name in my life. Before this happened, I couldn’t have picked him out of a lineup. The only reason I can pick him out of a lineup now is because I just saw his mug shot on most every front page of every newspaper in America.

It worked. You’re famous, Jussie! For being the most pathetic loser and egomaniac in the history of the TV business. And that’s saying a lot!

But understand what this was really about: blaming, denigrating and framing an entire race. White people. In particular, white, straight males who support President Donald Trump. Talk about a hate crime. This is the ultimate hate crime from the mind of a liberal with “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”

Smollett’s hoax could have led to police blaming two innocent white males. They could have spent 20 years in prison for a “hate crime” that never happened. Smollett’s hoax could have led to race riots, or assaults, or even murders of innocent white males, perpetrated by thugs thinking it was fair retribution because it looked like “open season” on blacks by white racists. Jussie could have set America’s race relations back 50 years.

I was the first to call it a hoax and a scam. And I was the first to say he deserves serious prison time. Let’s hope that happens.

But the real question is: Why was the biased, liberal, mainstream media and literally every Democrat presidential contender fooled? Why didn’t they see what I saw?

The answer is simple: Trump Derangement Syndrome.

More proof that liberalism is a mental illness. This is the kind of madness and fantasy that plays in the minds of many liberals and Trump haters — even Democrat presidential candidates. How sad.

Mansour invited King’s comment on the state of race relations, highlighting a February-published Gallup poll showing increasing dissatisfaction with race relations over recent years.

Mansour noted, “Gallup has been polling on [race relations] for a number of years; since 2001, at least. Back in 2001, at least 70 percent of black Americans graded race relations as very good or somewhat good, and 62 percent of white people agreed. Now, it shows that over time — and it started in 2013 — our attitude and optimism towards race relations has taken a nosedive, and now it’s almost at a really low ebb. Only 55 percent of white Americans, and only 49 percent of black Americans view race relations in a positive light.”

Mansour asked, “All of the stories out now that seem to be pulling us apart — especially the Jussie Smollett thing that just happened — how do we come back and heal? What do we need to do? What’s going on with our country, right now?”

“Consciously … I made a decision that I would not defend anybody for being called a racist, anymore,” replied King. “I would not fight against people and call others racist. I would come up with this particular truth. We hold many truths to be self-evident. Well, this should be one of those truths. Of one blood, God made the human race. God created the human race.”

LISTEN:

King recalled, “My uncle, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, or perish together as fools. Well, you can’t be brothers and sisters with a different race. So we are one blood. We all bleed the same, and as a result we are the human race.”

King continued, “Now, we have different ethnic groups — different ethnic distinctions — and that’s a good thing. We should celebrate our differences. We can’t go around and say, ‘I don’t see color. I’m colorblind,’ because if you don’t see my color, you have a deficiency. Colorblindness is a medical condition. It could be a spiritual condition. Open your eyes. See me. Celebrate me. Love me. Respect me. Regard me, and I will do that for you as my brother or sister. So we can see color.”

King concluded, “You know that old saying, if we don’t know our history we’ll repeat it? Well, if we don’t know our history we also can’t repeat the good part of our history; the good things. So we must now see ourselves as human beings with ethnic differences, socioeconomic differences, but one blood, and if we do that more, that’s how we’re going to break through this new rash of racism, I call it. But we have to understand that we’re one human race. Praise the Lord.”

The Empire actor was charged with felony disorderly conduct Wednesday night following the brothers' testimony before a grand jury. The Chicago P.D. claimed the actor paid Ola and Abel Osundairo $3,500 to fake an attack, but new reports say there's more to the story.

According to TMZ, the brothers made a deal with Smollett to train him for five weeks so he could get in better shape before filming an upcoming music video.

Smollett reportedly told Ola he wanted abs like his, so the brothers agreed to train him and give him a 5-week nutrition plan. The actor told the brothers that he would pay them for their services, but they didn't discuss a specific amount.

A few days before the ""attack,"" Smollett reportedly wrote the brothers a check for $3,500. The memo line read: ""5 weeks training nutrition plan.""

The outlet reports that the brothers told the grand jury they were paid for the 5-week program and not for the ""attack."" Another source told the outlet that the brothers said they thought the amount was ""a little high,"" but there was no discussion about the money being part of a scheme.

During the grand jury testimony, the brothers also denied sending Smollett the threatening letter mailed to him eight days before the attack.

Smollett surrender to police ahead of his bond hearing Thursday, and was later released after paying 10 percent of the $100,000 bail. Following the events of the day, Smollett's legal team released a statement maintaining his innocence.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Since his indictment, Smollett has been dropped from the final two episodes of the fifth season of Empire.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" a statement released by producers read.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season."""

CHICAGO, Feb 24 — American advocacy groups and police have a shared concern over the fallout from allegations that an openly gay black TV actor faked a hate-motivated assault: That future victims will face more scepticism even as hate crimes are on the rise.

Chicago police have accused Jussie Smollett of engineering an elaborate hoax to exploit Americans’ anxieties over political and racial divisions in order to generate publicity and a bigger paycheck.

The 36-year-old star of the Fox drama Empire allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump’s “Make American Great Again” slogan.

Smollett is charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was freed Thursday on US$100,000 (RM400,000) bond.

“If true, then this is a disgraceful exploitation of many past victims of real hate crimes, many of whom have endured heinous suffering,” Kami Chavis, a former assistant US attorney in the George W. Bush administration, told AFP.

The actor’s lawyers, in a defiant statement, criticized law enforcement’s actions as an organized “spectacle” and maintained Smollett’s innocence.

But whatever the final result, the case has left gay rights and racial justice advocates, along with politicians and government officials, worried about future victims. Will they be believed?

Worry over ‘scepticism’

“Bogus police reports cause real harm,” an angry Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson told a news conference Thursday, after detailing what his detectives learned over a three-week investigation.

“My concern is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of scepticism that previously didn’t happen,” Johnson said.

The initial news of the purported attack at the end of January generated an outpouring of support for Smollett, who in the past has lent his celebrity to gay rights, racial equality and other causes.

But as the case — with disturbing details such as a rope allegedly put around Smollett’s neck — appeared to turn and the actor went from victim to suspect, many who had rushed to condemn the attack were left struggling to respond.

On Friday, the producers of Empire, after repeatedly standing by the actor before he was officially charged, said he would be removed from the final two episodes of the current season “to avoid further disruption on set.”

Rights advocacy groups and activists fell mostly silent as details leaked out of the investigation. But they eventually focused on a common theme: Hate crimes are happening with increasing frequency even if the Smollett case turns out not to be one.

More hate crimes

The FBI says that during the incendiary first year of President Donald Trump’s term in 2017, the number of hate crimes rose 17 per cent nationwide. Last year’s figures are not yet available.

The Southern Poverty Law Centre in 2018 counted an all-time high 1,020 hate groups in the United States.

The most recent report from the Anti-Defamation League found anti-Semitic incidents surged 60 per cent in 2017.

In 2018, 26 transgender people were killed, most were black trans women, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

“As we learn more details about Jussie’s arrest, we remain focused on the urgent fight against the very real issues of racism, homophobia, and hate violence,” said a joint statement from Colour of Change and GLAAD, which are focused on racial justice and gay rights issues, respectively.

Chavis, who is an expert on hate crimes laws and is director of the Criminal Justice Programme at Wake Forest University’s law school, says hate crimes victims have already faced big obstacles.

“There is a long history of these victims not being believed,” Chavis said.

“Jussie Smollet’s actions should not deter law enforcement officials, prosecutors and jurors in future cases.”

But could it deter public support?

Media ‘played for fools’

Critics have pointed out that in the initial rush to support an apparent hate crime victim, many celebrities, commentators and politicians condemned the attack with little scrutiny of the underlying claims.

“The media should be the most outraged. He played all of them for fools,” tweeted Nikki Haley, Trump’s former UN ambassador.

Politicians have had to awkwardly back-pedal from their original comments, such as Senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate.

She had initially called the Smollett case one of “attempted modern-day lynching.”

But when asked by a reporter earlier this week on the campaign trail in New Hampshire about her thoughts on Smollett, Harris initially hesitated and appeared to grasp for a response.

On Thursday night, she posted on Facebook that she was “sad, frustrated, and disappointed,” while turning the attention back on victims.

“We must speak the truth: Hate crimes are on the rise in America,” Harris said.

“Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address.” — AFP"

According to Hollywood Life, Terrence Howard took to his Instagram account this weekend to share a video of Jussie Smollett, and let his followers know exactly how he feels about his on-screen son following all of the controversy that has been surrounding him in recent weeks.

In the video, Jussie is seen holding Terrence’s baby boy, Qirin Love Howard, while the trio flew on a private plane together. Smollett makes the baby boy giggle as he plays with him and tickles him with a big smile on his face. Later, the little boy snuggles up to Smollett, who reveals just how sweet the little guy is.

Jussie can also be heard asking Terrence how many teeth his young son has. In the caption of the video, Howard reveals that he and his family “love” Smollett, seemingly showing off another side to the actor who has been through so much drama over the past month, and showing support for his friend in the process.

Terrence didn’t reveal whether he believes Jussie’s story about being attacked, or his pleas of innocence, but simply that he loved his friend and co-worker.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jussie Smollett told police that he was attacked by two masked men in late January. The Empire star stated that the men had called out racist and homophobic slurs to get his attention, and once they had him they poured a chemical substance on him, hit him with their fists, and put a rope around his neck.

Smollett filed a police report and later went on Good Morning America to tearfully tell his story. However, Chicago police claimed they didn’t believe everything that the actor was saying and eventually arrested two Nigerian brothers who say that Jussie had staged the attack with them.

Smollett was charged with a felony for filing a false police report and arrested earlier this week. He was let out on bail and was said to go immediately to the Empire set to apologize to his co-workers for all of the negative attention he was bringing the show.

Fox then announced that they would be cutting Jussie from the final episodes of the season, leaving fans wondering if he’ll get fired for good in the coming weeks.

Jussie Smollett has continued to maintain his innocence through all of the controversy, and still has the support of at least one of his co-stars in Terrence Howard."

This includes several politicians, including multiple 2020 presidential candidates.

One of those candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris, had reacted to reports that Smollett was attacked by calling it a “modern-day lynching.” After the charges were filed, Harris issued another statement, per The Inquisitr, and proclaimed herself “sad, frustrated, and disappointed.”

Now, the names of Smollett and Harris are connected in another way through the spread online of a totally false conspiracy theory, which alleges that the two are related and that perhaps Harris played a role in the hoax.

Per reporter Ben Collins of NBC News on Twitter, the conspiracy theory appears to have originated on 4Chan. It alleges that Harris is, in fact, Jussie Smollett’s aunt, they were once photographed at the same rally, and that therefore she conspired with him to stage the attack. The “evidence” for this is that Smollett’s mother’s maiden name is Harris and that a Harris-sponsored anti-lynching law had passed the U.S. Senate around the time of the false attack.

A post by conservative blog The American Thinker alleged that the “Chicago political machine” assisted Smollett with the hoax, with the site quoting a series of tweets by the Twitter personality Tariq Nasheed, asking “who else was involved in this hoax.” Actor James Woods tweeted that article to his large Twitter following.

This ""Kamala Harris is Jussie Smollett's aunt"" conspiracy was fueled from a few 4chan posts from several days ago.



One is just a baseless speculation on the same, extremely common last names of family members.



It heated up because people didn't know ""nephew"" was slang. pic.twitter.com/ktAdCOlwKd — Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) February 23, 2019

In fact, Harris is not Smollett’s aunt, nor are they related at all. No profile of either of them has ever mentioned a relation, while Harris’ only sibling is Maya Harris, a former Hillary Clinton adviser who is now working on her sister’s campaign. Maya Harris is not Jussie Smollett’s mother, although she was subject of her own conspiracy theory last month, related to years-old news that she had been hired by MSNBC, per The Inquisitr.

Furthermore, there is nothing in any of the charging documents for Smollett, or in any statement by law enforcement during any stage of the case, indicating that any outside figures participated in Smollett’s alleged hoax, aside from the two brothers who were formerly suspects. And the anti-lynching law passed unanimously in mid-February, per Harris’ website, meaning that participating in a faking of a hate crime involving a celebrity would likely not have been necessary."

But after alleging that Smollett, who is black and gay, “took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Jackson added, “I’m left hanging my head and asking, ‘Why?’ ”

Good question. Why, indeed, would an actor reportedly making $1.8 million a year stoop so low and risk it all?

The short answer is greed; Smollett allegedly wanted a raise.

But assuming that Smollett is not completely off his rocker, there must be more to his thinking, and there is. The added element also explains much of the vicious, anything-goes turmoil roiling our nation: Smollett thought he could get away with it.

And why not? One look around America would tell him that blaming President Trump and his supporters for the worst things imaginable is the fastest way to become a celebrated victim and a hero to half the country.

And victimhood is making some people very, very rich.

Smollett could have correctly concluded that events don’t even have to be true to be solid gold. Enough people are willing to believe the worst because, hating Trump with every fiber of their being, they need the worst to be true.

The more serious the charge, the more they fantasize it will be the death knell of his presidency. That makes Trump haters easy prey for con men.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on their fantasies when she said the president “may not even be a free person” next year. Her words made headlines, not because she has any insider knowledge, but because her claim sent lefty hearts aflutter.

Warren, of course, is a professional con artist of long standing, so expect to see more sleight-of-hand as she seeks the Oval Office.

If police are correct, Smollett played his trick by scripting events designed to activate all the erogenous zones on the political and cultural left. His claim that his “attackers” made racist and anti-gay slurs, threatened to lynch him and declared Chicago “MAGA country,” was an immediate smash hit with his intended audience.

Overnight he became a household name as Hollywood and Democrats — excuse the repetition — embraced his story without a shred of doubt. See, see, they said, that’s Trump’s America for you.

Their enthusiasm reflected their self-interest. Smollett’s story was tailored to fit all the corners of the narrative they’ve been selling since Trump came down the escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy. Smollett played the Trump haters like a Stradivarius.

He got bonus points for being the right kind of victim but the clumsy plot outlined by cops shows he lacks the gravitas of more experienced cons. Take Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who is turning a disgraceful career-ending episode into a major pay day.

McCabe, after failing to bring down Trump, got fired for lying under oath — but now gets the star treatment on a book tour. What Trump-hating lefty wouldn’t want a piece of that action?

Perhaps Smollett fantasized he could get rich like McCabe or suddenly become a giant media star like James Comey. The former head of the FBI, Comey tarnished the bureau’s legacy for a generation, then painted himself as a victim of Trump and helped to spur the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For his efforts, which included a book and coming out of the closet as an anti-Trump partisan, Comey became a millionaire several times over.

Of course, Comey and McCabe didn’t exist in a vacuum. They were part of an administration that weaponized law enforcement and intelligence to boost their preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and destroy Trump.

Seeing how they basically got caught and still got rich, Smollett might have decided that, no matter what, he’d be rewarded, much as former top officials James Clapper and John Brennan got TV contracts after clearly abusing their official powers to play politics.

As for Clinton herself, she lost an election she should have won in a cakewalk — yet managed to launch the lie that Trump stole victory. Her lie remains an article of faith among deluded millions who believe it because they want it to be true.

But Smollett’s scheme would have made no sense unless he could count on the complete cooperation of one other player: the media. He would need them to swallow his story, then amplify it and repeat it a thousand times over.

Naturally, they did, because they, too, desperately wanted it to be true.

He hand-picked his interviewers, and played the role of his life — a defiant victim of Trump Nation. Smollett aimed to be so good and so appealing that he wouldn’t just get a raise, he’d be a mega-star and his career would take off like a rocket.

He might even have gotten a call for a starring role in Sunday’s Oscar telecast. Imagine the Hollywood elites, comfortable in their sneering disdain for Trump’s America, rising to applaud him as he appeared on stage as a stand-in for their America.

The world would watch movie stars cry real tears of admiration and sympathy. Smollett would bask in their salute, a bold, strong member of the resistance. Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.

What could go wrong?

Cuo’s big tax fib

Whopper alert.

Endlessly creative in distorting the truth of the new federal tax law, Gov. Cuomo now says Trump “gave an unseemly tax cut to corporations and the rich and he financed it by raising taxes on primarily Democratic states through the elimination of SALT” or state and local taxes.

In fact, the law does not eliminate SALT deductions. It limits them to $10,000 a year, and that provision is why those Americans getting federal tax hikes are mostly the high earners Cuomo claims got a tax cut.

Similarly, Cuomo’s goal of reinstating unlimited deductibility would hugely benefit those earning over $500,000 a year.

Meanwhile, he’s pushing a regressive tax hike in Manhattan by calling it congestion pricing. The fee of more than $13 a day would hit all drivers, regardless of income, making it a new tax of over $3,000 a year.

Even more galling, that money would go to the MTA to make up for the wild spending Cuomo failed to control.

‘Team’ fouls

According to my unscientific survey, all politicians now sign fundraising appeals with the word “team.” As in “TeamRice” (Kathleen) and “TeamMitch” (McConnell).

Dear Pols, We know your letters are mass produced and that consultants told you the word “team” adds a human touch. It doesn’t. Please stop.

Signed, Real People

Trevor Noah and his team of writers on the Comedy Central show were so taken with the “crazy story” of the “Empire” star being accused of staging his own attack that they decided it would make a great Lifetime TV movie — and they made a trailer to prove it.

“It seems like a fake story, and we’re, ‘It seems like the perfect Lifetime movie,'” Noah said. “So why not make a little movie?”

And as a birthday present for Noah, his creative team pulled together a trailer for “Jussie’s Lie,” a fake behind-the-scenes movie of how they think Smollett’s story came to pass.

“Coming this fall, the story of a lie that rocked a nation,” the announcer says, fading into Jaboukie Young-White playing Smollett, who is sitting in his dressing room when he is handed a wad of cash by what is supposedly an “Empire” exec.

“What? $60,000? I’ve worked three days this week,” Young-White’s Smollett whines.

The “suit” replies, “Maybe you’re not as important as you think.” Young-White’s Smollett throws the cash down and cries, “It’s not enough. It’s just not enough.”

And then he has a light-bulb moment. He cuts letters from a magazine and pastes them on a threatening note… which erroneously reads, “I’m going to kill me.”

Authorities claim that Smollett paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack against him.The attack caused an uproar as Smollett was portrayed as the victim of a hate crime which didn’t actually happen. As the investigation was conducted after the attack, police went from regarding the incident as a potential hate crime to considering it as an alleged hoax.Edward Wodnicki, commander of the Area Central Detective Division of the Chicago police, provided a detailed timeline of the investigation which led detectives to conclude that Smollett faked the attack during a press conference last Thursday, according to BuzzFeed news.Smollett reported the attack to police at 2 AM on Jan. 29 as a hate crime. He claimed that two people had yelled anti-black and anti-gay slurs at him, beat him, put a rope around his neck, poured a bleach-like substance on him, and then fled the scene.Smollett suffered from a few bruises and scratches which were later determined as “self-inflicted.”Chicago police started a full-scale investigation into the attack, saying on Twitter that they were taking the allegations of a hate crime “very seriously.”On Jan. 30, police released surveillance footage showing two men in the area of the incident. The footage didn’t capture the incident itself, but police began looking for the men as people of interest.At the press conference on Thursday, police stated that Smollett likely wanted the incident captured on footage, but the camera was facing another direction at the time.Smollett was seen on surveillance footage leaving his house for a Subway restaurant and then returning to his house, where the alleged attack happened.At the time, police began searching for more footage and witnesses in an attempt to find the two alleged attackers, according to BuzzFeed.Detectives interviewed over 100 people in the area and reviewed footage from around 35 Chicago police pod cameras and 20 private security cameras, in an effort to track the movements of the two people.From the videos, police determined that two men fled on foot towards the Chicago River. They then got into a cab by the Hyatt Regency hotel and exited the cab about 15 minutes later and headed to their Lakeview apartment.Police interviewed the cab driver and used surveillance footage to try and reconstruct their movements before the alleged attack, BuzzFeed reported.By backtracking their movements, police determined that the two men had taken Uber to the area of the planned attack from a few blocks away from their apartment and then took a taxi to the scene of the incident.From the time they were dropped off by the taxi to the time of the incident, footage shows the two men wandering around the area.At 2 am, the two men waited for Smollett at the scene of the planned attack, but Smollett didn’t show up on time. The two men waited on a bench near the area and staged the attack when Smollett showed up four minutes later. The incident took about 45 seconds, prosecutors said, according to BuzzFeed.Uber records lead investigators to identify the two men as brothers Abimbola ""Abel"" and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo.Police determined that the men had flown from Chicago O’Hare International Airport to Nigeria. They were set to return to Chicago on Feb. 13.In the meantime, police executed over 50 search warrants and subpoenas, including for phone and social media records. Authorities determined from phone records that Smollett had talked to the two men at least an hour before and after the incident, and while they were in Nigeria.The two men were taken into custody at O’Hare Airport on Feb. 13, according to BuzzFeed. After speaking to the two men, their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told detectives that “something smelled fishy,” Wodnicki said.Schmidt believed that the two men were the victims, not the offenders in the case. Detectives were then allowed to interview the suspects on video.“It was at that time that this investigation started to spin in a completely new direction,” Wodnicki said.Police used the information from the two men to substantiate the timeline and details of the incident.On Feb. 15, after being in custody for about 47 hours, the two men were released without any charges. They were no longer considered suspects, and instead were considered witnesses, according to police.Detectives were later able to obtain a $3,500 check Smollett had given to the brothers to stage the attack. He was also going to pay them $500 more once they returned from Nigeria, according to BuzzFeed.On Feb. 18, police scheduled a meeting with the Cook County grand jury to look into the witnesses’ statements. Police said that, at the time, Smollett’s attorneys wanted to bring evidence to postpone the grand jury, but Wodnicki said that they “gave us no new information.”The two witnesses testified to the grand jury and this past Wednesday, police officially filed Smollett as a suspect for filing a false police report while detectives presented evidence to the grand jury.Chicago detectives arranged with Smollett’s attorneys for him to turn himself in once the felony charge was approved. Smollett turned himself in at 5 am on Thursday."

Maher mentioned that he was just kidding, highlighting that “I love Texas.” But as we saw later in the show, it’s safe to say that the comic might not have been joking.

Maher argued that “if liberals are serious about winning elections, they have to start re-colonizing the parts of the country they’ve abandoned.” He added that, in his book: “If we keep leaving the red states behind, they’re going to keep getting angrier and crazier. Because if you’re not invited to the party, the next best thing is to throw a turd in the punchbowl.”

Having previously brought up the concept of “spatial geographic inequality” in which “the most affluent and educated people” live in “just a few cities,” Maher proceeded to read aloud a quote from Hillary Clinton, who said that “I won the places that represent two-thirds of America’s gross domestic product…I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward.”

The HBO host used Clinton’s quote as a springboard to portray red states as backward, outlining an elitist fantasy of what would happen if Amazon moved to West Virginia; starting off by predicting that “people get better jobs that don’t give them black lung (and) the locals meet people of different backgrounds and races and sexual orientations.” Maher also took a shot at those who still believe in traditional marriage: “They find out gays don’t ruin anyone’s marriage, but they do improve the karaoke scene.”

Continuing to elaborate on this trope, he suggested that, at a hypothetical Amazon headquarters in West Virginia, a gym “that admits women” would open, implying that red states see women as second-class citizens. He later concluded by predicting that in a post-Amazon West Virginia, “there’s legal weed and decent healthcare and the schools are teaching science again.”

In a strange twist of irony, Maher then signed off by announcing that he would soon be visiting the red states of Louisiana and Indiana. Go figure.

The Empire star took to Instagram Saturday to share a touching video of Smollett playing with Howard's infant son while on an airplane, adding a message of support amid his indictment with felony charges related to his alleged Jan. 26 ""attack.""

""All your lil homies got you... We love the hell outta you,"" Howard wrote in the caption of the heartwarming video.

Smollett has been caught in the middle of massive controversy after he was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, after Chicago P.D. delivered evidence that he may have played a role in his own attack.

The actor, who has played the role of Jamal Lyon on the FOX drama since its debut, has maintained his innocent throughout the ordeal. He recently surrounded to Chicago police and was released on bond later Thursday.

Howard's support for his co-star comes as reports had surfaced claiming some members of the cast and crew are ""furious"" and feel the actor should be fired from the show.

The cast members reportedly feel ""hurt and embarrassed"" after defending Smollett following his initial claim in January that he was a victim go a hate crime. The report by TMZ also claimed that ""almost everyone"" on set of the FOX drama is worried how the scandal will affect the series.

Empire producers — Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer — also recently announced Smollett would be dropped from the last two episodes of Season 5 to avoid further disruptions to production as the case unfolds.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" the statement read.

""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

After being released, Smollett's legal team issued a statement on recent events, reiterating the actor's innocence.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,"" the statement read.

'Some of the stars are 'f*****g furious' about the allegations and believe he should be fired for bringing shame to the entire production, according to TMZ.

Jussie reportedly pleaded with his colleagues to believe that he did not pay two Nigerian brothers to attack him in a staged hate crime so that he could get a raise, as is alleged by police.

Gabby Sidibe, one of Smollett's closest friends, deleted her supportive Instagram post on Thursday night.

A day earlier, she had written: 'I know him, I believe him, I stand with him'

Prosecutors say they have a mountain of evidence which proves it was a hoax and Jussie will be charged.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

The seeds for Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate-crime hoax may have been planted when an emotional “Empire” creator Lee Daniels spoke out about his cousin getting assaulted because he’s gay, according to a report.

The theory among some “Empire” cast members is that Smollett sought to play on Daniels’ emotions in the hopes of becoming “an LGBT hero” and curry favor with his boss, TMZ reported, citing anonymous sources.

The 59-year-old Daniels, using the handle, theoriginalbigdaddy, posted a heartfelt one-minute video on Instagram on Jan. 10 advising his “gay brothers and sisters” that it “was OK to be who you are” and “inevitably right will be done.”

Daniels captioned the post, “This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories…” and “For all the people who are hurting, who are struggling, and who are trying to find some meaning in this life, I am here to say if you need a safe place or a ear to listen, then I’m here.”

After his cousin’s attack, Daniels showed up to the “Empire” set and “shared more about the story. Everyone was visibly upset that Lee’s family had gone through this horrific ordeal,” the TMZ report said.

If Smollett was looking to tug at Daniels’ heartstrings, he was initially successful.

On Jan. 29, the day of Smollett’s alleged hoax attack, Daniels tweeted, “We got this,” accompanied by rainbow and black hand emojis.

In a whirlwind turn of events, Smollett, a 36-year-old gay and black actor, was charged Thursday with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly faking his own hate attack.

The actor claimed he was slugged by two strangers who called him a “f—-t,” a “n—-r” and shouted, “This is MAGA country!” just outside his apartment before dousing him in bleach and throwing a rope around his neck.

Chicago authorities said he plotted the bizarre scheme to bolster his own career and get a raise.

Smollett denies it was a hoax, and has told cops he has an “untreated” drug problem.

Smollett’s character on “Empire” will be removed from the final two episodes of this season in the wake of his arrest. Fox has requested security from Cook County cops when it films scenes for an episode on Wednesday."

But Friday’s news that Smollett won’t appear on the final two episodes of this season of “Empire” leaves his future on the series very much in doubt, part of the cascading fallout of one night on a Chicago street in January. It left Smollett facing felony charges and raised the possibility that his role as Jamal Lyon could mark the pinnacle of the 36-year-old’s career.

Smollett, who is black and gay, told police he was the victim of a hate crime committed by men who threw liquid in his face, yelled racist, anti-gay slurs and looped a noose around his neck. After a three-week investigation, Smollett was charged Wednesday with staging the attack with help from two brothers he knew and allegedly paid for their services.

Even in an industry in which bad or erratic behavior is expected, insiders and observers are stunned by what authorities allege was fakery intended in part to get Smollett publicity and a raise.

“This is incredible. No one does this,” said Garth Ancier, a veteran network executive and a co-founder of the Fox network. If more money was his goal, that’s what agents and negotiations are for, he said, calling the alleged hoax “beyond the pale.”

“It’s too bad that such a talented guy threw all that away,” Ancier said, adding he didn’t see how he could be kept on “Empire.”

There are two episodes of the show left to make of the 18 airing this season, the fifth year for the series starring Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard as hip-hop moguls Cookie and Lucious Lyon.

In a statement, “Empire” producers said Friday that while they care about Smollett deeply, “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. At this point, Smollett is part of the seven already completed episodes.

Before Friday’s statement, Fox had publicly stood behind Smollett even as skepticism about the attack arose. Replacing Smollett so late in the series might be problematic. Writing his character, one of three Lyon sons, out of future seasons would be less so.

Smollett’s legal team released a statement late Thursday calling Chicago police’s version of events “an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” the statement said.

After Smollett was charged, TNT’s celebrity battle-rap series “Drop the Mic” pulled an upcoming episode with him “in the interest of not being exploitative of an incredibly sensitive situation,” the network said in a statement.

Experts in the field of crisis management were pessimistic. The online mockery Smollett is taking is unlikely to stop, and it could hinder any attempt to re-emerge, said Eric Dezenhall, CEO of the public relations firm Dezenhall Resources.

“The thing it’s really hard to come back from is ridicule,” Dezenhall said. “It can be easier to come back from something just bad. In our culture the whiff of something dangerous has a certain street cred. But here we’re talking about a combination of malevolence and ridiculousness.”

Eden Gillott, president of Gillott Communications, offered a similar take.

“This could be a career-killer. We’ve seen this many times. Society has become more intolerant and unforgiving,” said Gillott, citing instances ranging from Kevin Spacey’s firing from “House of Cards” for alleged sexual misconduct to Megyn Kelly’s “Today” exit after she defended blackface costumes.

What Smollett is alleged to have done isn’t analogous to either one — or to just about anything that’s happened with a celebrity or prominent person in recent memory or in news files.

There have been stunts, such as Joaquin Phoenix’s role in a so-called documentary, “I’m Still Here,” directed by actor Casey Affleck and supposedly about Phoenix’s career as a rapper in decline. The film’s release came with public apologies and lawsuits attached.

Others have exaggerated their exploits, such as TV journalist Brian Williams’ account of being in a helicopter hit by a rocket in the 2003 Iraq invasion or Hillary Clinton’s 2008 account of landing under sniper fire during a 1990s trip as first lady.

But Smollett, instead of creating an image-burnishing fiction, positioned himself as a victim and the deserving centerpiece for outrage directed at his attackers. He said those who questioned him made him feel “victimized.”

The allegation that Smollett did it for money could be seen as both a betrayal and baffling, given what he earns: more than $1.8 million for the current 18-episode season of “Empire,” according to a person familiar with the situation.

Dezenhall said it would be tough for Smollett, who proclaimed himself innocent of the charges through his lawyers, to explain himself publicly.

“All of us have said something stupid, put something in an email we shouldn’t have — we can understand that. But very few of us would say, ‘I would orchestrate something like that to advance my career.’ There’s a difference between a mistake and a scheme,” Dezenhall said. His advice to Smollett: “‘Vanish for a few years, take up a cause, devote yourself to doing something good, and revisit it later.'”

Or search out people like Kandi Burruss, the singer-songwriter and reality star.

“I consider him a friend. I love him and regardless of if it’s true or not, I’m still going to be here for him. I hate the situation but I don’t hate the person,” she told The Associated Press Thursday at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood luncheon.

Even the folks who say they “never watch television” watch a lot of television. Binge watching is a thing and fans of the hot shows proselytize for their latest obsessions with the messianic intensity of a street-corner evangelist. Is it any wonder we elected a TV star president?

And is it any wonder the phony racist, “Trump-inspired” non-attack attack on “Empire” actor, Jussie Smollett, grabbed headlines? Now, Smollett has been charged with staging the attack for personal gain, slandering the president’s supporters, the city of Chicago, and in the process exposing how deeply invested in our own preconceived notions we’ve become. Psychologists call it, “confirmation bias,” and we all suffer from it, never more so than today.

When Smollett’s “attack” was first reported, many prominent celebrities and politicians raced to social media to mark themselves woke. “This was an attempted modern-day lynching,” said California Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris. “This racist, homophobic attack is an affront to our humanity,” tweeted Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

That so many people rushed to support Smollett — including the famous people who should know better considering how many lies have been said, published, posted and broadcast about them — illustrates how confirmation bias has become baked into our culture. If someone we dislike is accused of something nefarious, we’re quick to howl. Meanwhile, if someone we like lands in hot water, we either construct alibis on their behalf or try to square the moral math by pointing to some equally awful thing someone on the other side did. Many of the folks quick to support Smollett in February were among the first to condemn high schooler Nick Sandmann in January. Sandmann was vilified for smirking at Native American Nathan Phillips, but his real crime was being pro-life and supporting President Trump. For millions, a MAGA hat equals guilty.

Meanwhile, the MAGA hat crowd has their own confirmation biases. The flavor of the month is freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist, who conservatives continue to conflate with everyone from Fidel Castro to Joseph Stalin, unable or unwilling to make the distinction between the disaster in Venezuela and the success of social democracies like Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.

Significantly, the president of the United States has a long history of rushing to judgment. One of Trump’s first major forays into politics was a full-page ad in four newspapers, including “the failing New York Times” in 1989, calling for the execution of the “Central Park 5” for a rape they did not commit. And he’s not the only president who has rushed to judgment.

Barack Obama infamously threw the entire Cambridge police department under the hybrid, claiming they had “acted stupidly” while responding to a call to professor Henry Louis Gates’ home. The facts proved otherwise. Thomas Jefferson pronounced his former vice president, Aaron Burr, guilty of treason in 1807 before his trial even began. Burr was acquitted.

Scores of innocents have been falsely accused, from the “witches” of Salem to the Scottsboro Boys, from the interred Japanese to Emmitt Till, from Richard Jewell to Gary Condit and the Duke University lacrosse team. Lies have proven fatal.

While announcing Smollett’s arrest, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, an African American, asked with emotion, “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

Sadly, Smollett is not alone.

In 1987, Tawana Brawley invented an outrageous story of racial hatred and rape. In 2008, Columbia University professor Madonna Constantine, under investigation for plagiarism, “found” a noose on her office door. The incident was condemned by everyone, including then-President George W. Bush. It’s now widely believed Constantine placed the noose herself or had friends do it to distract from the plagiarism charges. She was fired by Columbia.

There have been similar cases of false racial assaults on the campuses of Ole Miss, George Washington University, and closer to home, at Claremont-McKenna College, where Kerri Dunn, a visiting psychology professor, claimed her car had been defaced with racist graffiti. In 2004 she was convicted of filing a false hate crime. These incidents, and many more, have led conservatives to view with skepticism and defensiveness accusations pointing the finger at one of their own.

Meanwhile, a flurry of headlines from this past week alone, explains why so many on the left view conservatives with their own skepticism, if not outright hostility.

An old and ugly interview with movie icon John Wayne resurfaced and went viral. “I believe in white supremacy,” said the Duke. “We can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks,” continued Wayne, specifically referring to the radical African-American activist, author, educator and communist, Angela Davis. Still, that “white supremacy” stuff hasn’t exactly aged as well as “The Searchers.” In the same interview, Wayne minimized slavery as “a fact of life.”

Last week, we also saw an Alabama newspaper call for, “the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again.” When asked to explain, the editor/publisher/author, Goodloe Sutton, went further, saying, “We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,” his solution to powerful liberals in Washington. Then news broke of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson’s arrest for allegedly plotting the murder of prominent Democrats and media figures, which again tees up how dangerous President Trump’s “enemies of the people” tweets are. Reckless language can lead to real violence, like the left-wing nut who tried to wipe out the Republican congressmen practicing for the annual bipartisan baseball game. Meanwhile, last Sunday, Louis Farrakhan accused “wicked Jews” of trying “break up” the women’s movement. And on and on it goes.

Both the left and right have lunatic fringes they keep at arm’s length, yet tolerate, so they’ll show up on Election Day. When ugly stories appear in the news, they’re quickly magnified by the echo chamber and soon these freaks become representative of everyone who believes, looks, prays, sleeps with or votes differently than we do. That’s how confirmation bias is born.

You decide...

While Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been having a tough week so far, there appears to be a silver lining: cable news channel CNN has offered Smollett a job as an investigative reporter and on-air anchor after witnessing his skills at fabricating a story entirely out of thin air.

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated.

""Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,"" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. ""He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.""

The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narratives ex nihilo, according to insiders."

A recent story that actor Jussie Smollett was offered a job as an investigative reporter for CNN is false, according to Snopes.com. The article was published by satirical website the Babylon Bee.

Chicago police on Wednesday charged Smollett with making a false police report after he claimed he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack Jan. 29 in his downtown Streeterville neighborhood, according to The Associated Press. Charged with felony disorderly conduct, Smollett could face up to three years in prison and be required to pay for the cost of the investigation.

According to the fake story, CNN offered the ""Empire"" star a job ""after witnessing his skills at fabricating a story entirely out of thin air.""

The Babylon Bee story has a CNN representative saying, ""Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization.""

Some readers mistook the article for a genuine story even though the website's disclaimer reads, ""The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire,"" Snopes said.

Pence didn't say people need 'Jesus care'

A quote that recently resurfaced online falsely claims Vice President Mike Pence said, ""What the American people need is not more health care. What we need is more Jesus care,"" according to PolitiFact.com.

Pence's press secretary Alyssa Farah told PolitiFact, ""The quote is fake and wasn't said by Vice President Pence.""

The quote first appeared in May 2017 after the U.S. House passed a measure to partially repeal the Affordable Care Act, PolitiFact said. It showed up again earlier this month and was shared nearly 200 times in less than 24 hours.

The quote goes on to say, ""I believe if we can just get more of the people with pre-existing health conditions back into churches, you would see a lot of healing and many of these problems would go away. People who lead godly lives don't worry about doctors. We have The Lord to take care of us.""

The image includes a photo of Pence and a symbol made to look like a Fox News logo, PolitiFact said.

Ocasio-Cortez not paid by Netflix

Netflix recently paid a reported $10 million for the worldwide rights to ""Knock Down the House,"" a documentary about four candidates who ran against incumbents in the 2018 midterm elections.

But a claim circulating online that New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a subject of the film, was paid $10 million by Netflix is false, according to The Associated Press.

""None of (the film's) subjects received or will receive any payment for participating in this project,"" director Rachel Lears told AP. Only producers, financiers and filmmakers received payment from the sale to Netflix, Lears said.

The documentary, which recounts the campaigns of Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush of Missouri, Amy Vilela of Nevada and Paula Jean Swearengin of West Virginia, won the Festival Favorite Award at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, AP said.

Fake quote attributed to former Starbucks CEO

A Facebook post claimed former Starbucks CEO and possible presidential candidate Howard Schultz said he would prefer to hire undocumented immigrants over veterans.

Not only is there not evidence Schultz said this, according to PolitiFact.com, but an internal group at the company, the Starbucks Armed Forces Network, provides jobs and support to current and former military employees.

In March 2017, the internal group announced it reached its goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and active-duty spouses and set a new goal of 25,000 by 2025, PolitiFact said. The group said Schultz helped lead the initiative, contributed personal finances and visited military bases.

Starbucks made a pledge in 2017 to employ 10,000 refugees following President Donald Trump's travel ban against Muslim-majority countries, PolitiFact said, which resulted in people calling for boycotts of the coffeehouse chain and a call to hire veterans. The company's pledge to hire 10,000 veterans began in 2013.

The post with the false quote was flagged by Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.

194,https://streetwiseprofessor.com/race-hoaxers-like-jussie-smollett-deserve-a-special-place-in-hell/,,Race Hoaxers Like Jussie Smollett Deserve a Special Place in Hell,[],,"['deserve', 'place', 'special', 'political', 'maga', 'chicago', 'assault', 'trump', 'especially', 'fact', 'race', 'wrong', 'hell', 'judgment', 'smollett', 'hoaxers', 'jussie']","There is a particularly nasty place reserved in hell for the likes of Jussie Smollett. Given the fraught state of race relations in the United States, people of good will attempt to pour oil on troubled waters: evil people throw the oil on the flames. Smollett is definitely an incendiary of the first order.

For the most venal of reasons–getting a pay raise–Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to stage an assault on him. Smollett then told police that he had been jumped at 2AM on a Streeterville (Chicago) corner by two white men in MAGA hats, who beat him, spewed racist and anti-gay epithets, put a noose around his neck, and doused him with bleach.

The story immediately went viral, and became a cause celebre, even although the details of the story were wildly implausible, to put it mildly. The men supposedly yelled “You are in MAGA country.” Chicago? Really?

In point of fact, a Trump supporter is more likely to be assaulted in Chicago than a Trump supporter is likely to assault anyone there. (What? You hadn’t heard those stories repeated 24/7? Go figure!)

Further, two racists are wandering the streets at 2AM, on a freezing cold night, and just happen to have a rope and bleach handy, and just happen to cross paths with a black, gay B-list actor? Whom they recognize? Every racist trope personified just happens to be walking the streets of Chicago in the bitter cold when the city is otherwise deserted, and just happens to intersect with a two-fer in the victim class stakes?

Occam’s Razor much? The lurid details that excited frenzy were in fact what should have cast the most extreme doubts about the story.

Yet despite the sheer improbability (and arguably impossibility) of this, Smollett’s story became accepted fact. And Smollett’s space in hell will be spacious, because those who echoed and amplified his tale are just as evil as he.

And this includes virtually every major Democratic Party figure, most notably the entire throng of presidential candidates (notably Harris, Booker, and Warren), Nancy Pelosi, and the poster girl for the airhead left, AOC. It also includes most of the mainstream media, most prominently CNN and MSNBC.

These arsonists are in many ways worse than Smollett, because they repeatedly asserted that the attack was symptomatic of endemic and epidemic racism in the US, and that any Trump supporter–or any non-Trump-hater–was an accessory, and perfectly capable of carrying out a similar attack. It was blood libel on a grand scale.

Official Chicago largely went along with the Smollett story–just read the Chicago PD’s official spokesman’s timeline on Twitter if you doubt this. But some rank and file cops were apparently furious, and leaked the truth to various local Chicago reporters–who were themselves furious set upon for their heresies, and other “journalists” were well-represented in the mob that went after them.

But inevitably, the truth eventually came out. Smollett had hired two Nigerian brothers to stage the assault. When they were threatened with charges for assault and battery, they rolled on Jussie. They were caught on video buying the rope and hats–they purchased the rope at a hardware store hilariously named “The Crafty Beaver.” The most sickly amusing part of the story was that the brothers could not even find real MAGA hats: they had to settle for generic red hats. So yeah, Chicago is such hardcore MAGA country you can’t even find a MAGA hat for sale there.

Upon revelation of the truth, the responses of the Smollett story enablers and amplifiers ranged from the craven to the mendacious. The craven ones deleted their tweets, or remained silent, or dodged questions about their previous remarks. The mendacious ones doubled down or denied that what we saw with our own eyes–the MSM’s hyping of the story–had occurred. You will search in vain for genuine apologies, or even an acknowledgement along the lines of “I was wrong about the story.”

Unsurprisingly, CNN is the most mendacious of all. Fat tub of goo (especially between the ears) Brian Stelter claimed that only entertainment journalists had hyped the story, but that mainstream outlets–CNN most notably–had reserved judgment. Or consider this from Chris Cillizza:

And so, Democratic 2020 candidates were very quick to believe Smollett’s version of events. And now Republicans — especially those aligned with the Trump White House — are just as quick to seize on the idea this was all an elaborate hoax. Both sides are simply exhibiting confirmation bias. Because we reward that sort of thing in our politics now.

Them damn Republicans. Always seizing on one damned thing or ‘nother. So many seizures. Maybe they have epilepsy.

The fact is, Clownzillia, that one side’s suspicions were confirmed by the facts, and the other side’s assertions proved utterly false. One side was right: it was an elaborate hoax. The other side was horribly, horribly wrong. This assertion of equivalence between wrong and right is disgusting, and earns you a spot right next to Smollett.

I’m old enough to remember when “rush to judgment” was a bad thing. But now it is the default setting, especially on the left, and especially especially when the judgment can be used to attack Trump, or far worse, vast swathes of innocent Americans who commit the mortal sin of holding non-leftist political views.

And their motives for rushing to judgment are even more damning. They want stories like Smollett to be true because it validates their twisted view of America. And worse yet, because they believe that they can use these stories to enhance their power, bludgeon their political and social enemies, and advance their political and social agenda. And worst of all, rather than attempting to tamp down racial animosity, they feed the flames because they believe that it redounds to their political gain.

There would perhaps be room for optimism if those who had flogged the story originally were to acknowledge error, and pledge to do better next time. But this has not happened, meaning that these events can only feed deep pessimism about the prospects for American civil society."

An actor stages a phony hate crime with himself as the victim and is celebrated by presidential candidates. A college professor is blacklisted over alleged sexual harassment charges that were dismissed. A congressman faces a civil trial for allegedly drugging and molesting an underage girl, yet continues in office as if it’s not even happening.

It seems that we have a new justice system in which people are dragged into an unseen courtroom and judged by an invisible mob. Some defendants are banished. Others are pardoned.

We should try to understand the rules of this court, because the sentencing can touch down like a tornado on a Kansas plain. Just this week, John Wayne was condemned for offensive comments he made in a 1971 interview in Playboy magazine, and no comedian would host the Academy Awards out of fear that a thousand activists were viewing VHS tapes around the clock to find something that would offend them.

The Jussie Smollett case is a developing example of how the career death penalties and pardons are handed out. In January, the actor told Chicago police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two men wearing Trump-style “Make America Great Again” caps. Smollett, who is African American and gay, said the men called him offensive names, poured a bleach-like chemical on him, looped a rope around his neck in the manner of a noose and shouted that the neighborhood was “MAGA country.”

For a couple of weeks, Smollett hit the jackpot of free publicity. The story was reported on that endless loop in which every comment by a celebrity or politician is reported along with a full recap of the original story. For those with a thirst to characterize President Trump and all his supporters as deplorable, racist, homophobic bigots, the story was perfect.

It just wasn’t true.

Two men were picked up for the “crime” and they told police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Smollett quickly descended from victim to suspect. However, producers stood by him as the story melted down, issuing a statement on Tuesday calling him “a consummate professional” and reiterating that “he is not being written out of the show.” Only when Smollett was formally charged with making a false police report — motivated by a desire for a salary hike, according to Chicago police — did 20 th Century Fox Television issue a statement from the show’s executive producers saying they have “decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,” referring to Smollett’s character. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” they said.

That’s more due process than was given to Roseanne Barr after she tweeted an offensive joke. No amount of apologizing saved her from professional banishment. Is an offensive joke worse than a faked hate crime? What are the rules that determine who is forgiven and who is exiled?

A hint can be found in the experience of a professor of philosophy who was falsely accused of sexual harassment but has been banished from his profession anyway.

In 2012, a female graduate assistant to Prof. Colin McGinn sued the University of Miami, McGinn and another UM philosophy professor. The lawsuit sought $16 million from the school for failing to fully investigate the woman’s claims of sexual harassment, which she documented by producing text messages from McGinn. Professor Edward Erwin, a colleague of McGinn’s, was named in the suit as well, accused of defamation.

The woman’s credibility sank when McGinn produced the text messages she had sent to him but previously concealed from the school. In 2015, a judge dismissed all charges against Erwin and all but one charge against McGinn (a single charge of defamation) “with prejudice,” indicating the judge’s negative view of the charges. In 2016, the lawsuit was settled for zero dollars in damages and only partial payment of the woman’s legal fees. Everybody signed a non-disclosure agreement except Erwin, who refused.

McGinn left the university in 2013. Even though he never was charged with sexual harassment by the university, and even though a judge dismissed the sexual harassment charges in the lawsuit, McGinn has since been blacklisted from publications, professional conferences and academic employment. As for Erwin, who did nothing inappropriate, he recently told an Orange County gathering of the National Association of Scholars that since the lawsuit, no graduate student has signed up for one of his courses, asked him to serve on a dissertation committee or requested that he write a letter of recommendation.

Last August, Erwin published an article in an online free-speech magazine called Quillette. It is titled, “The New McCarthyism: Blacklisting in Academia.”

In contrast to their experience, consider what is happening, or not happening, to California Congressman Tony Cárdenas.

A 28-year-old woman who has now identified herself as Angela Villela Chavez last year filed a lawsuit alleging that Cárdenas drugged and sexually molested her when she was a 16-year-old junior golf star and he was on the Los Angeles City Council. Chavez’s father was a longtime City Hall aide to the councilman.

Cárdenas denies the charges, but a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled last fall that the lawsuit has enough merit to go forward. The trial is scheduled to begin in August.

Last May, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi promised an investigation. “As Members of Congress, we each have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of the House of Representatives, and any type of alleged misconduct must be investigated by the Ethics Committee,” she said.

But on Feb. 12, Washington, D.C., journalist Susan Crabtree reported on RealClearPolitics.com that there still is no investigation underway.

These are allegations of child sex abuse against a sitting congressman. Where’s the tweeting and shouting?

It's the question that all celebrity gossip fans and even hard news followers continue to ask when it comes to Jussie Smollett.

Why on earth would he orchestrate an assault against himself in Chicago, as he stands accused of doing by the Chicago Police Department?

On Thursday morning, Smollett turned himself into the police on a charge of falsifying an official report.

This is a felony that could land the Empire actor behind bars for three years and it stems from an incident that he claimed took place around 2 a.m. on January 29.

As you must know by now if you're reading this, Smollett made national headlines by alleging that not only was he attacked on the way home from a late-night snack, but...

The attackers were white.

They yelled racial and anti-gay slurs in his direction.

They screamed he was in ""MAGA country.""

They tied a rope around his neck.

They poured bleach all over him.

Based on interviews with two Nigerian brothers, who know Smollett well and who told cops he hired them to stage this event, along with evidence gathered via cell phone records and surveillance video, the police now believe none of the above happened.

They think Smollett has been lying to us all.

So, againm, we return to the major question here:

WHY?

Initial reports alleged Smollett was getting written off Empire and this was a last-ditch attempt to save his job.

During a press conference late this week, the police superintendent came right out and said Smollett committed this crime because he was upset about his salary.

Neither of these explanations makes much sense.

So TMZ has now offered up another.

Sources have told this website that Smollett may have been inspired by an attack on the cousin of Empire creator Lee Daniels.

Like Smollett, his cousin is gay.

Lee shared a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia because, in that same post, the veteran producer wrote:

""This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories.""

Smollett has been an active member of the LGBTQ community for years and, as far as this theory goes, he was trying to alert the world to the rampant homophobia out there by making himself a very public victim.

It's worth emphasizing: This is just a theory.

In a couple more updates to this crazy story:

Smollett has been written out of the final Empire episodes of this season, but has not been officially fired.

The siblings who have admitted to working with Smollett on this set-up told a grand jury on Wednesday that the $3,500 check they received from the actor was actually NOT a payment for their role in the act.

They say it really was payment for help with personal training.

Again: This story is downright crazy.

And it doesn't appear as if it will calm down any time soon.

Jones started off by pointing out that it has been a bad week for both sides of the political aisle and social media divide.

“You can see the danger now of all this overheated rhetoric and people rushing to judgment on both sides,” Jones said referring to the Jussie Smollett story and the Coast Guard lieutenant who stockpiled weapons and had a hit list of media and political targets.

Then after advising President Donald Trump and progressives to be more careful with their words in light of the current political climate, he stressed that this is the time for America to keep its head on straight and “focus on facts, not spin” especially considering what may lie ahead with the end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller‘s probe.

“We’ve got another political firestorm on the way almost two years, 34 people charged, seven guilty pleas, hours of cable TV analysis, 25 million bucks, and 166 tweets from Trump calling it a witch hunt. It looks like we finally have the Mueller probe coming to an end. So please be careful because I predict a whole bunch of confusion, more partisan spin from people who haven’t even read the report, which is exactly what we don’t need. Before you’ve even had a chance to read whatever they release, you’re going to have a thousand posts on your social media feeds either claiming that Trump has been fully cleared or saying lock him up, depending on whatever camp you’re in.

Kelly, giving him a chance to go free while he awaits trial on charges that he sexually abused four people.

Lyke, the judge who presided over ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week, called the allegations against Kelly ""disturbing"" and said that the bond equals $250,000 for each of the four people Kelly is charged with sexually abusing. The bond requires the Chicago native to post $100,000 before being released. Lyke also banned Kelly from having contact with anyone younger than 18.

During Saturday's 17-minute hearing, Kelly’s attorney Steve Greenberg told the judge that, ""Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn't like to fly"", referring to the Grammy winner's popular song ""I believe I can fly"".

The singer was charged with 10 counts of criminal sexual abuse involving at least three underage victims between 1998 and 2010 on Friday, each carrying a maximum of seven years in prison. Greenberg rejected allegations that Kelly sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have non-consensual sex"".

Greenberg also told reporters that he believes all four women in the case “are lying"".

""Mr Kelly is strong, he's got a lot of support and he's going to be vindicated on all these charges — one by one if it has to be"", he said.

Kelly’s DNA was found in semen on one of the accuser’s shirts, and semen found on one worn by another was submitted for DNA testing, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. According to Foxx, Kelly met one of the accusers when she was celebrating her 16th birthday party at a restaurant and another when he signed an autograph during his 2008 trial on child-pornography charges.

Prosecutors also said they have a video of another accuser that shows R. Kelly having sex with her when she was 14, and the fourth accuser told prosecutors that she thought she was going to braid R. Kelly’s hair, but that he instead tried to force her to give him oral sex.

The Empire star had said he was subjected to a homophobic and racist physical attack by two men in January.

Police suspect the 36-year-old actor paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. They are both co-operating with the investigation, US media report.

He is due to appear in court later on Thursday. His lawyers earlier said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"".

What do police say?

Suspicion over the actor's claim started to grow after police said they could not find any video footage of the alleged incident from surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators managed to track two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked.

The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week.

They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said. One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire.

A lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, said they had chosen to testify because ""there was a point where this story needed to be told"". She added: ""They manned up and said: 'You know what? We're going to correct this'.""

On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. What happens now?

Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday and is in custody of Chicago police, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

R&B singer R Kelly has appeared in court in Chicago where a judge has set bail at one million dollars (£766,000).

The judge at Saturday's hearing, Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, is the same judge who presided over Empire actor Jussie Smollett's bail hearing earlier this week.

Kelly was charged on Friday with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time.

Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx says the alleged abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.

The 52-year-old Grammy winner's lawyer said Friday that he was confident Kelly would be vindicated.

Judge Fitzgerald Lyke Jr said during Saturday's hearing that the bail amount equalled 250,000 dollars for each of the four people he is charged with sexually abusing.

He called the allegations against Kelly ""disturbing"" during the hearing.

The singer stared at the floor while the judge was speaking and looked dejected.

Kelly had spent the night in jail before being taken to the court.

He stood with his hands behind his back and said to the judge: ""How are you?""

Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said his client was not a flight risk and told the judge: ""Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn't like to fly.""

The bail requires Kelly to post 100,000 dollars (£76,000) to be released.

A prosecutor told the judge that Kelly met one of the four accusers at his 2008 trial on child pornography charges.

The two met when he gave her an autograph, and the alleged abuse occurred between 2009 and 2010.

The accuser gave law enforcement a shirt that had Kelly's DNA on it, the prosecutor said.

Kelly has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

After the hearing, Greenberg told reporters that he thought all four of the accusers were lying.

""He did not force anyone to have sex. He's a rock star. He doesn't have to have non-consensual sex,"" Greenberg said."

New investigative details have revealed the clues that made Chicago cops suspicious of Jussie Smollett's story from the very start.

After three weeks of investigation, police publicly announced on Wednesday that they believed Smollett had hoaxed the attack that he claimed was perpetrated by white men shouting racist and anti-gay slurs.

But details released from the Cook County State's Attorney office show that even the first officers to respond to Smollett's report of an attack on January 29 had reason to be suspicious.

'Chicago Police Officers observed that Smollett had a rope draped around his neck,' Risa Lanier, a Cook County State's Attorney, wrote in the bond proffer.

'This was captured on police body worn camera. Seconds later, Smollett asked police to shut off the cameras,' she continued.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson (above) expressed outrage at Smollett for allegedly lying to investigators. Police were suspicious of his story from the very start

Police responded to Smollett's Streeterville apartment about 45 minutes after the purported attack.

Though Smollett explained that he had left the rope around his neck to 'preserve evidence', the responding officers were privately baffled that he was still wearing the noose somewhat like a necktie, according to sources briefed on the investigation.

Per Chicago Police Department policy, the officers informed Smollett that their body-worn cameras were active, and he requested that they be shut off - another nagging hint that something was off, sources say.

Cops also found it odd when Smollett led them outside his apartment to show them where the alleged attack took place, and immediately pointed out a security camera that he believed had captured the incident.

Smollett also referred to this security camera during his now infamous interview with ABC's Robin Roberts.

'I looked up and I saw there was a camera directly on the light-post that is in the intersection, so I'm like 'There it is,'' Smollett said. 'And then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north. So they didn't have it, and that was disappointing.'

In this interview with ABC News, Smollett described the camera he though had captured the attack. Police say he pointed out the camera to them immediately

Police now say that Smollett had specifically cased that camera with brothers Abimbola 'Abel' Osundairo and Olabinjo 'Ola' Osundairo, bodybuilders of Nigerian descent whom he is accused of paying to stage the attack.

On January 27, two days before the attack, police say that Smollett picked up the brothers in his car and drove them to the intersection to plan the attack.

'Smollett directed the brothers' attention toward a surveillance camera on the corner, which he believed would capture the incident,' Lanier wrote in the bond proffer.

In his initial report of the attack, Smollett also perplexed investigators by refusing to turn over his cell phone to responding officers, who wanted to verify that he had been on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

The records he ultimately handed over were heavily redacted - which sources say allowed cops to zero in their investigation by focusing on the call records that he had deleted, by comparing them with records obtained through subpoena of his phone carrier.

As the investigation progressed, CPD was very careful in its public statements, continuing to describe Smollett as an 'alleged victim' up until the point that charges were filed.

Though the camera outside of Smollett's apartment was pointed a different direction and did not capture the attack, it and other cameras ultimately unraveled the case.

Smollett eagerly pointed out this camera to police as he described the attack, but didn't realize that it was pointed in the other direction and had not captured the incident

After extensive canvassing, police were able to track the movements of the purported attackers to the point they left and arrived in hired cars, and use taxi and rideshare records to identify them.

The brothers confessed their involvement, and receipts for the purchase of items used in the attack, as well as a personal check Smollett wrote to Abel for $3,500, offered damning evidence that the attack was indeed a hoax.

At a press conference on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson expressed outrage at Smollett for allegedly lying to investigators.

'Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?' Johnson said. 'How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?'

Smollett is charged with disorderly conduct-false report, a Class 4 felony.

He continues to vigorously maintain his innocence. The producers of the television show Empire have said that he will be cut from the final two episodes of the season.

Smollett is currently free on a $100,000 bond and is next due in court on March 8."

The singer, real name Robert Kelly, appeared for a bail hearing in Chicago today and the judge was given an outline of the case against Kelly.

The court heard allegations that the musician was first acquainted with one of his accusers when she asked him for an autograph outside court.

He was being tried on child pornography charges in Chicago – of which he was acquitted – at the time.

The prosecutor told the judge that Kelly had invited the female, who was aged 16 at the time, to his house where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

Kelly appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star’s bail at $1 million.

The singer is described as showing “very little emotion” and kept his eyes fixed on the floor for the majority of his time in court.

The judge described the allegations against Kelly as “disturbing” and ordered him not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.

Kelly’s attorney reportedly argued that the star is currently broke due to a number of financial setbacks.

Attorney Steven Greenberg is said to have told the judge Kelly has a child support judgement against him that he’s unable to pay and he’s not making any money.

Greenberg claimed Kelly’s earning very little from his music and is not touring.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

He has spent years fending off sex abuse allegations and has previously denied any wrongdoing."
