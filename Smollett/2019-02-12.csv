CHICAGO -- Actor Jussie Smollett on Tuesday dismissed any suggestion that he has been less than cooperative with police since the star of the ""Empire"" television drama reported he was attacked by two masked men in Chicago last month.

Police sources told TMZ that Smollett handed in the phone records two weeks after the actor alleges he was attacked. The records were a PDF file of his phone bill which was heavily redacted. The source said a PDF file could be easily manipulated. Numbers could be deleted or added.

The only irrefutable evidence would be a download of Smollett’s phone or the original phone bill.

Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told The Advocate the police were very thankful of Smollett’s cooperation, but the type of record he handed in does not meet the burden necessary for a criminal investigation as they were heavily redacted and limited in nature.

When interviewed, Smollett stated he told the police he was talking on the phone with his manager when the attack happened, and he could corroborate his story. The phone records may have helped the police put together a timeline of the attack.

Police reported there are extensive surveillance cameras in the area of Smollett’s building, and they have been unable to find video footage of the attack.

Smollett’s team would not comment to the Advocate if they will now give police the phone to help with the investigation. Police reported the case is being treated as a hate crime, and Smollett has been cooperative.

Now, reports are coming out that she was a tyrant behind the scenes.

According to Radar Online, a source claims, “During rehearsals, she was barking at the dancers and she kept breaking down and getting frustrated because it wasn’t going her way.” The source described her as “a complete diva,” very difficult” and “wouldn’t allow anyone to tell her what to do.”

She reportedly “demanded preferential treatment over everyone, including Lady Gaga.” Gaga and Lopez did take a photo together but it was allegedly all for show.

Lopez did respond to the backlash by telling Entertainment Tonight that Grammy producers and Motown co-founder Berry Gordy were happy she was doing the tribute. “It was a natural fit for them,” she said. “But for some people, [it wasn’t], and that’s OK. I’m just very humbled and honored to be able to have sung those songs.”

Before the performance, Motown legend Smokey Robinson defended Lopez. The 78-year-old icon bluntly said, “I don’t think anyone who is intelligent is upset. I think anyone who is upset is stupid.” He added, “Motown was music for everybody. Everybody… I think anyone who is upset is stupid.” See below:

Some of the greatest artists of all time came out of Motown Records. We’re talking the likes of Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and The Temptations, to name a few. Motown churned out Black artist after Black artist who became icons of music in a time when Black people were combating overt racism on the daily.

There will be a full Motown tribute show, titled “Motown 60: A GRAMMY Celebration,” which will be taped Tuesday but air April 21 on CBS.

“Hosted by Cedric the Entertainer and GRAMMY winner Smokey Robinson, the tribute to the iconic sound that changed America will feature Boyz II Men, Chloe X Halle, Ciara, Lamont Dozier, Fantasia, Brian & Eddie Holland, Thelma Houston, Tori Kelly, John Legend, Little Big Town, NE-YO, Pentatonix, Martha Reeves, Diana Ross, Valerie Simpson, Mickey Stevenson, Meghan Trainor, and Stevie Wonder,” a statement read.

Smollett had declined until this week to turn over the records that detectives had requested after Smollett said that he had been the victim of an attack on Jan. 29 by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him.

CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett on Tuesday said he redacted some information from his phone before giving it to Chicago police investigating a reported attack on the “Empire” actor in order to protect the privacy of contacts and people who are not relevant to the attack.

Smollett’s representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

ADVERTISEMENT

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” the statement said. “Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.”

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren’t sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett’s statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

“Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,” his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled “This is MAGA country, ” a reference to the “Make America Great Again” slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Now, reports are coming out that she was a tyrant behind the scenes.

According to Radar Online, a source claims, “During rehearsals, she was barking at the dancers and she kept breaking down and getting frustrated because it wasn’t going her way.” The source described her as “a complete diva,” very difficult” and “wouldn’t allow anyone to tell her what to do.”

She reportedly “demanded preferential treatment over everyone, including Lady Gaga.” Gaga and Lopez did take a photo together but it was allegedly all for show.

Lopez did respond to the backlash by telling Entertainment Tonight that Grammy producers and Motown co-founder Berry Gordy were happy she was doing the tribute. “It was a natural fit for them,” she said. “But for some people, [it wasn’t], and that’s OK. I’m just very humbled and honored to be able to have sung those songs.”

Before the performance, Motown legend Smokey Robinson defended Lopez. The 78-year-old icon bluntly said, “I don’t think anyone who is intelligent is upset. I think anyone who is upset is stupid.” He added, “Motown was music for everybody. Everybody… I think anyone who is upset is stupid.” See below:

Some of the greatest artists of all time came out of Motown Records. We’re talking the likes of Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and The Temptations, to name a few. Motown churned out Black artist after Black artist who became icons of music in a time when Black people were combating overt racism on the daily.

There will be a full Motown tribute show, titled “Motown 60: A GRAMMY Celebration,” which will be taped Tuesday but air April 21 on CBS.

“Hosted by Cedric the Entertainer and GRAMMY winner Smokey Robinson, the tribute to the iconic sound that changed America will feature Boyz II Men, Chloe X Halle, Ciara, Lamont Dozier, Fantasia, Brian & Eddie Holland, Thelma Houston, Tori Kelly, John Legend, Little Big Town, NE-YO, Pentatonix, Martha Reeves, Diana Ross, Valerie Simpson, Mickey Stevenson, Meghan Trainor, and Stevie Wonder,” a statement read.

Smollett, who stars in Fox's Empire as one of the most prominent black gay characters on television, told authorities that he was attacked in the early morning hours of Jan. 29 by two men who yelled racist and anti-gay slurs, hit him in the face, poured a bleachlike chemical on him, and tied a rope around his neck.

Authorities said Smollett also reported that his attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country.""

Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Both Smollett and his music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, have told authorities that they were talking to each other on the phone during the reported attack, but as of Sunday, police said they were unable to independently verify the call.

""We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Post on Sunday.



Guglielmi told the Post that police had offered to take Smollett's phone to download the data, but that the actor ""expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

However, Chicago police on Monday said that Smollett had submitted ""limited and redacted"" phone records, but added that they were not ""sufficient"" for the ongoing investigation.

""The records that were sent to us are not sufficient in a criminal case,"" a Chicago police spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.

Officials are analyzing the records and would contact Smollett ""should additional information be needed,"" the spokesperson added.

Smollett ""voluntarily provided his phone records"" within an hour of the attack, his publicist, Peter Larsen, said in a statement Tuesday.

""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" the statement said.

Larsen also said the actor has given police ""multiple statements"" and that investigators have ""repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.""

""[Smollett] is still considered a victim,"" the Chicago police spokesperson said, adding that some reports about police possibly charging the actor for making a false report were inaccurate.

Authorities are also analyzing a hot sauce bottle reportedly containing a clear, bleach-like liquid that was found by a New York Post reporter last week while retracing Smollett's steps during the reported assault.

The police spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that authorities had no information so far that would connect the bottle to the incident.

""[The bottle] was not found the first several times when officers and detectives canvassed the area,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are analyzing it.""

The FBI, which is assisting Chicago police, declined to comment on the bottle, as did Smollett's representatives."

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” Chris Bastardi, a spokesman for Smollett, said in an emailed statement. “Superintendent [Eddie] Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

The statement from Smollett’s camp came the same day that Chicago Police said the phone records that the actor had turned over were “insufficient for a criminal investigation.”

According to the department, Smollett on Monday gave police “limited and redacted” phone records from the early hours of Jan. 29 — the day he reported to police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

Smollett has told police that he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him, yelled slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck.

Smollett initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi previously said. But Smollett’s manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m. that morning.

The actor said he was on the phone with his manager when he was confronted. His manager has said that he could hear the attack over the phone and was able to hear the phrase “MAGA country” — the acronym for President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Bastardi said Tuesday that the phone records were redacted before they were given to police in order “to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

Tuesday, Guglielmi said that CPD detectives would soon be in touch with Smollett to gather more information.

Investigators have pored over surveillance footage from the neighborhood, but have yet to recover any images of the reported attack — which became national news in a matter of hours and spurred Congressman Bobby Rush to write to the director of the FBI to ask him to open a hate crime investigation.

Johnson earlier this month said that Smollett has been cooperative with detectives, and that the department is making progress in its investigation.

“We have no reason to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Johnson said. “The allegations that are described to us are horrendous, horrible and quite frankly cowardly. He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim.”"

Actor Jussie Smollett’s phone records that detail his calls during the night of his alleged hate-crime attack in Chicago have been rejected by local police as their investigation continues.

The records were delivered on Monday to Chicago police and were immediately deemed insufficient due to redactions made by the actor, which they say tamper the evidence.

""We are very appreciative of the victims cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Advocate.

Smollett stated in interviews with local police immediately after the attack that he was speaking on the phone with his manager, who could corroborate many aspects of the incident. These records could help investigators looking to piece together the timeline of the January attack.

Smollett faced criticism for refusing to give police his phone, but a spokesperson for the actor says Smollett wants to protect high-profile contacts stored on the device.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,” a spokesperson for the actor told The Advocate, referring to past statements made by the department.

The Empire star — who came out on Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show in 2015 — reported to police last month that he was stopped around 2 a.m. on January 29 in downtown Chicago by two men wearing ski masks and yelling racial and homophobic slurs. The individuals then reportedly placed a noose around Smollett’s neck, punched him, and then poured an unknown substance on his body.

""This is MAGA country,"" the men then yelled, according to interviews conducted by the Chicago police with the actor. Smollett’s manager has told police he heard this language among racial and homophobic slurs.

A video of Smollett with a rope around his neck returning to his building after the reported incident has been recovered by the police but has yet to be released. Local police say they will not release this footage until the investigation in finished.

The FBI’s separate investigation into hate mail addressed to Smollett with an image of a man being shot is also still on-going. The two agencies will not comment on whether these incidents are related.

Smollett’s spokesperson tells The Advocate that the actor remains confident that the perpetrators will be found and he remains available to the police for any interviews or questions.

However, his team would not comment on if he will now hand over the phone to police as they continue to investigate."

John McCain reportedly “blew up” at producers.

A source told Radar Online that after Monday’s show, McCain, 34, “blew up” at producers over Behar’s “unfair treatment” toward her. Reportedly, McCain is “losing patience.” However, the execs are “100% behind” 76-year-old Behar.

In case you missed it, while discussing Sen. Amy Klobuchar announcing she was running for president, McCain kept trying to jump into the conversation by saying, “Can I say something now? Joy, is that okay? Do I have your permission to speak now on Amy Klobuchar, we’re all good?” She started babbling then stopped and said, “By all means, keep going Joy.”

Behar clapped back with, “No, if you’re going to have a hissy fit, we can’t continue.” McCain looked like her head was about explode and barely spoke for the rest of the show.

See below:

The two have been bickering for months. Back in December, according to The Daily Mail, when Whoopi abruptly cut to commercial after one of their spats, Behar yelled in front of the audience, “Get this b***h under control. If this s**t doesn’t stop I’m quitting this damn show. I can’t take this much more.” Reportedly, producers jumped on stage but the New Yorker wasn’t done, she added, “I’ve tolerated a lot of s**t on this show but I’m at my wits’ end with this entitled b***h. Enough already! Enough already! I’m not playing nice any longer.”

If you missed that moment in December, McCain was demanding that the only topic of the day should be praising President George H. W. Bush, who died at 94 years old. However, Behar was pointing out Bush’s record on global warming (he signed the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990), which Trump has rolled back.

Watch below:

Hopefully, Meghan McCain will learn not to come for Joy Behar. She is the only original host from and has seen them come and go.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that while walking home to his apartment earlier this month, he was accosted by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. He said the two men beat him and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him.

According to a police report, responding officers found the 36-year-old with a white rope hanging from his neck.

Smollett initially told police that during the attack he was on the phone with his manager, and his manager claims to have heard part of the attack - making him the only known witness.

Smollett's crisis manager, Chris Bastardi, told Fox News: “Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from Day 1 that Jussie is a victim.

Smollett did not initially submit his phone records to investigators when asked but later submitted a redacted version that detectives have judged to be “insufficient.”

The reported incident is currently under investigation by police, who requested Smollett’s phone records. Smollett was allegedly on the phone with his manager at the time of the encounter. The manager allegedly heard the suspects yelling racial and homophobic slurs.

The 36-year-old handed over his redacted phone records through a PDF file format. Sources close to TMZ revealed the PDF was not entered into evidence because PDFs are easily manufactured and changed.

A rep for Jussie told TMZ, “Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

Police have requested to receive the original call records or data from Jussie’s phone.

(Alabama Mexican restaurant edition)

We have all heard about the completely unbelievable story about “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. He was allegedly assaulted at 2 a.m. by two guys who attacked him over his homosexuality and his race in Chicago. They apparently dumped a liquid on him and placed a noose around his neck in subzero temperatures. As the targeted assault was taking place out of the view of all cameras, they reminded him that the city of Chicago, Illinois, has always been and will always be “MAGA Country,” the claim states.

Totally real, right?

This obviously does not pass the smell test, but that doesn’t matter. The American media and law enforcement aren’t about to tell a liberal black gay actor he is lying. Victims must be believed, even if there is not a single shred of evidence to back the allegation. Smollett has shown no interest in helping them attempt to corroborate his assault, but he will continue to use the accusation as an attention grabber and a rallying cry.

Totally happened.

A restaurant in Huntsville now seems to want to get in on the victimization Olympics.

Allegedly, a man who hates Hispanics went last weekend to his local Mexican restaurant, Charrito’s Bar & Grill, decided to dine on some Mexican food and utter a racial comment to a waiter.

That racial comment? “Do white people ever use cash?”

Totally believable.

So, I asked the reporter at WHNT-TV in Huntsville a few questions.

Dale, thank you for reading my article. 1. Yes and a picture of the receipt is posted on the restaurants facebook page.

2. It’s signed but you cannot see the signature in the image.

3. His name is not on the receipt and the people I spoke with did not know it. — Jordan Dafnis (@JordanDafnis) February 12, 2019

The reporter said she saw a credit card receipt with a signature but no name.

But no one she talked to knows the name of the guy? She talked to the owner, by the way.

Totally reasonable.

Neither the reporter or the victims of totally real racial hatred seem all that interested in an outing this vile racist, who left a credit card receipt to go along with his racist tirade.

I understand the restaurateur not wanting to out the racist because … actually, it makes no sense.

But the reporter and anyone else who covered this story appear to have forgotten about the “The Five Ws.” These are the five things you need to know when you gather information: who, what, when, where, why.

WHO did this? Some guy.

WHAT did some guy do? Left a mean note.

WHEN did some guy do it? February 9.

WHERE did some guy do this? The beautiful Charrito’s Bar & Grill at the Villages of Providence, where the owner says they have “A lot of the things that we have are typical Mexican traditions that you would find in the typical Mexican home.”

WHY did some guy do this? Because he is racist and also enjoys Mexican food, making racist comments in public and then paying with his credit card as an identifier.

Reminder: No one at the restaurant knows the name of the guy that used his credit card.

OK, so run the story?

No. As it is written, it appears to be a cry for attention. It’s abetted by the fact that this story is just another story that is too good to check.

Why? Because it allows people who hate the president and his supporters to tar them all as racist monsters.

Why don’t we want to know the name of the guy who did this? They could name, shame and destroy his life. It’s not as if we don’t enjoy doing this on a regular basis in this country.

Why? Because it is fake and has been done plenty of times.

At this point, media outlets should be beyond skeptical of this ridiculous story and its many variations.

We don’t tip terrorists.

We don’t tip black people.

Get a real job.

We don’t approve of the gay lifestyle.

Could all of this be real? Sure.

Is there enough info here to malign an entire group of people or to reward a restaurateur for her unwillingness to tell the whole story? No.

This story should not have been told if the “who” is being withheld. The credit card receipt allows for him to be identified. The only reason not to identify the person is if he can refute this story. Period.

All of this is happening the same day a reporter is complaining about a “Fake News” t-shirt on display at Bloomingdale’s.

Hey @Bloomingdales, this isn’t funny or fashionable. It further delegitimizes hard working journalists who bring REAL news to their communties. pic.twitter.com/NedoHMAZfs — Allison Kaden (@akadennews) February 10, 2019

Unbelievably, the whining worked.

Imagine if these journalists cared more about their craft as much as they care about the people criticizing their failure to not be terrible.

Jussie Smollett is disputing any suggestion that the he is being less than co-operative with Chicago police detectives since the “Empire” actor says he was attacked in the city by two masked men.

A statement from Smollett Tuesday came after a police spokesman said that Smollett this week turned over some but not all of the phone records that detectives asked for and that the records he did provide were heavily redacted and insufficient for a criminal investigation.

But the representatives say the actor who had declined to turn over the records for more than two weeks after Smollett reported the Jan. 29 attack said that “Jussie is the victim here” and that he has provided records and given multiple statements to police. The statement says the redactions were made to protect “personal contacts or high -profile individuals” who have no connection to the attack.

Smollett has said he was walking in the downtown area when two men approached him, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, doused him with an unknown chemical before one of them looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck.

Smollett's representatives issued a statement a day after police said the heavily redacted phone records he turned over to detectives this week were insufficient for a criminal investigation.

The statement is the latest in a back-and-forth between Smollett and police since he reported the attack in downtown Chicago on Jan. 29. Police have made no arrests and said they have found no surveillance video that shows the attack. They have released video of two people in the area at the time who they said were persons of interest.

""Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,"" the statement said. ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.""

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren't sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett's statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled ""This is MAGA country, "" a reference to the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope."

Thus, most of us have forgotten about “Empire” star Jussie Smollett’s alleged victimization at the hands of two white hate criminals who apparently used homophobic and racial slurs against the gay, black actor during an alleged assault in Chicago while telling him, “This is MAGA country.”

There were several things that seemed rank about the whole account, not the least of which was that neither Smollett nor his manager would turn over phone records even though the two said they were talking to each other at the time of the assault and that the manager heard the politically charged language being hurled at Smollett.

Finally, two weeks after the attack, it seemed that there had been a break on that end:

It’s not just that they were “redacted,” however. Part of the problem is that the phone records were submitted to police in a format where they could easily be tampered with.

“Law enforcement sources tell us … what Jussie turned in 2 weeks after his alleged attack was a heavily redacted PDF file of his phone bill,” TMZ reported.

“Our sources say a PDF is subject to manipulation, meaning numbers can be added or deleted, although police are quick to point out there’s no evidence they were in fact manipulated. The problem … the only solid, irrefutable evidence is either the actual phone bill or a download of Jussie’s phone.”

I’m surprised TMZ needed sources to tell them this, but there you go. I’m sure this will help out, except for the fact that there’s no way to actually verify this without actually looking at the phone or the raw records, which Smollett and his manager refuse to turn over. So, in short, it won’t help at all.

One person on Twitter pretty much summed it up perfectly:

More or less, yes.

Perhaps the most surprising thing about this whole debacle is that the media seems utterly unwilling to call shenanigans on Smollett’s story at this point.

In spite of the fact that the alleged attack happened in one of the most heavily surveilled areas of Chicago, the action seems to have happened during a 60-second lacuna in video coverage.

The two persons of interest haven’t been located yet in spite of the fact that this is one of the highest-profile crimes in the country.

And, perhaps most puzzlingly, his Subway sandwich seems to have survived the attack just fine.

This case is beyond bizarre and it’ll likely only get stranger. Someone will likely end up being arrested, but it seems increasingly unlikely that it’ll be any alleged attacker.

We cannot at this point conclusively prove the negative, and maybe we never will. But we can use our faculties of reason and common sense and, based on the available evidence, arrive at the most plausible conclusion: it’s a hoax, and a pretty absurd one at that.

Before we look at the facts of the case, let’s review the claim. Smollett says he was walking back from Subway at 2 AM on a frigid Chicago night when he was suddenly attacked by two racist assailants. He says they assaulted him, poured a mysterious chemical on him, tied a rope around his neck, and shouted “this is MAGA country,” along with various anti-black and anti-gay slurs. Smollett claims that he fought off his attackers and made it home, Subway sandwich still in hand and rope still around his neck. Eventually he called the police and went to the hospital. The selfie he took in the hospital reveals a slight scratch on his face and not much else in the way of bodily injury.

Police are obviously skeptical of Smollett’s tale, but they have not yet officially called it a hoax. I believe the rest of us can have much more certainty than the police are willing to show. Here’s why:

1. The story is absurd on its face. It would be hard to believe no matter where it was supposed to have happened — but Chicago? Not just Chicago but one of the most liberal neighborhoods in Chicago. You may as well claim that MAGA terrorists assaulted you at a vegan convention in Portland. If there are roving bands of homicidal Trump-loving bigots prowling the streets, I doubt you’ll find them in Chicago, which most decidedly is not “MAGA country.”

And what were these violent bigots doing out in sub-zero temperatures with a noose and a bottle of bleach (which, by the way, would have frozen within minutes)? And if this is supposed to be a “random” attack, how did they know that Smollett was gay? Or was it targeted? Were they searching the streets and risking hypothermia in order to find and attack a relatively unknown supporting actor from a show they’ve almost certainly never watched?

Even if we allow for the possibility that the attackers exist, and we overlook all of the questions about how and why they were out in the middle of the night in Chicago pouring bleach on a black man, that still leaves us with the odd fact that Smollett wore the noose around his neck on his way back home. He had the presence of mind to retrieve his tuna sandwich, which was fortunately unharmed in the scuffle, yet, in a state of shock, he kept wearing the noose like a necktie? This couldn’t have been an effort to preserve evidence because, for one, he has been reluctant to produce evidence, and two, he was hesitant to call the police in the first place. You only set out to preserve evidence if you are absolutely sure from the get go that you will be contacting police — and you would contact them immediately.

2. Video footage does not support the claims. Police have been able to piece together Smollett’s entire jaunt to Subway, minus a 60-second gap that no security camera reached. There is no attack depicted in the available video. There is no footage of the assailants, either, aside from two guys who appear to be homeless and don’t fit the description Smollett provided.

Smollett says the attack happened in that 60-second span. That seems like an awfully short (not to mention suspiciously convenient) window for a desperate fight with two psychotic skinheads. The police say it’s indeed possible that the described assault began and concluded within one minute. Possible, sure. It’s also possible that Jack really did climb a magical bean stalk into the clouds. But possibilities and plausibilities are two different things.

3. Smollett has not been eager to help the investigation. He claims he was on the phone with his manager when the attack occurred, but for two weeks he refused to hand his phone over to investigators so they could corroborate the timeline. Finally, after two weeks, he did supply law enforcement with heavily redacted, and therefore useless, phone records. This is the kind of stonewalling you expect from the accused, not the victim.

4. Smollett is not behaving like the victim of a vicious beating. Just a couple of days after suffering, he claims, bruised ribs and other injuries, he was on the stage in West Hollywood singing, dancing, and showing no sign of physical impairment. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune of bruising their ribs knows that it is hard to move or breathe with that sort of injury, let alone perform a musical number.

5. His own neighbors don’t believe him. If his neighbors had come out and confirmed that these kinds of things happen in their community, that would go a long way towards vindicating Smollett. But they say the opposite. Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same building as the supposed victim, put it frankly to the New York Post: “I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

Does any of this prove that Smollett wasn’t really attacked? No, but then it is notoriously difficult and often impossible to prove that something didn’t happen. We can’t even disprove alien abduction stories or Bigfoot sightings. We can only use our heads, evaluate the evidence, and decide what is most likely. Sure, it’s possible that Smollett’s story happened the way he said. But in this case, the most likely thing is clear: Jussie Smollett is lying.

Chicago Police did not find videos of the attack, and said they have not identified any suspects. Multiple outlets had reported that police superintendent Eddie Johnson said he is considering charging Smollett with making a false report if the case proves to be a hoax.

""Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police,"" the statement said. ""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.""

But Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Monday that the phone records turned over by Smollett are in a heavily redacted document file and the records from the manager Smollett says he was talking to when the attack occurred were a screenshot of phone calls. He says the records aren't sufficient for an investigation.

Smollett's statement said he had good reasons for turning over limited information.

""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack,"" his statement said.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police that his attackers doused him with an unknown chemical substance, shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him before and looped a thin rope tied like a noose around his neck. Smollett also told detectives that before they ran off, the attackers yelled ""This is MAGA country, "" a reference to the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan President Donald Trump uses.

Smollett and his family have insisted that he has been truthful about the attack and his story has not changed since it happened.

Police have collected video surveillance footage from cameras in the downtown area and have also extended their search to stores in the area in the hopes of gathering evidence on who might have purchased the rope."

The police, Brandon pointed out, were not impressed:

As expected, police aren’t really impressed with what Smollett handed over, which are “limited and redacted,” causing police to ask for the full records according to ABC 7 Chicago’s Rob Elgas.

The actor alleges that two Trump supporters viciously attacked him as he walked home from Subway restaurant in the early morning hours of January 29th. He says the attacks were racist and homophobic in nature because of the slurs allegedly used. During the attack, Smollett says his attackers poured an unknown substance on him and put a rope around his neck, all while yelling “Welcome to MAGA country!”

But as reports continue to swirl that police are considering filing false report charges against the actor, a new piece of possible evidence in the case was reported on by the New York Post yesterday:

Last week, The Post traced Smollett’s likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad. Near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, The Post found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach. The Post alerted police, who seized the bottle. Guglielmi said it was turned over to the FBI for analysis. The FBI declined to comment.

The Loews The Post references in their story is the Loews Chicago Hotel. According to Smollett, a lower entrance to the hotel is where the alleged attack happened.

So if I’m reading all of this correctly, within a 60 second time span Smollett was viciously attacked by two hooded men who knew who he was while on his way back to the hotel from grabbing a sub. They yelled something about “MAGA country!” to the well-known actor, who detests President Trump.

These two random people who were walking around in the middle of the night happened to have their faces covered and were carrying a thin rope and a hot sauce bottle that contained bleach. The allegedly poured it on him and called him homophobic and racist names, and put the rope around his neck.

Smollett managed to stay on his phone with his manager throughout the attack, keep his sandwich, and he still had the rope around his neck when he casually walked into the hotel.

He was “hesitant” to call the police about the attack until he went to the hospital later that morning, and waited until two weeks after the alleged incident to give the Chicago PD only partial, redacted phone records.

Did I miss anything?

Smollett's music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told ABC News he was on the phone with Smollett during the alleged Jan. 29 attack and heard a ""scuffle"" and a ""racial slur,"" but Smollett initially refused to release his phone to cops so they could verify the claim.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Insufficient records

But while Smollett had a change of heart and gave police redacted phone records, the department said they are insufficient.

""We are very appreciative of the victim's cooperation. However, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation, as they were limited and heavily redacted,"" police told WBBM in an email. ""Detectives may be following up with the victim to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.""

Guglielmi added to the station that the redactions in the PDF file from Smollett are ""extreme"" but do include the hour before the alleged attack.

What's the background?

Numerous media outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the openly gay actor was beaten up after walking out of a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollett reportedly wore rope 'like a necktie'



Police told ABC News Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building.

CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

Other curious details:

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that detectives have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area and are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the individuals who match Smollett's description.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave,"" Guglielmi added to the AP.

Although police have since asked for help from the public in identifying two persons of interest from surveillance recordings near the site of the attack near the time it occurred.

The AP added that Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses, and in train tunnels — and that police said such cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests.

&lt;br&gt;

Smollett's neighbor doesn't believe the story

A neighbor of Smollett cast doubt on his story.

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the actor, told the Post. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

Other details

A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

The Post said last week it traced Smollett's likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad, and that near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, the paper found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

Guglielmi told the Post that after police seized the bottle it was turned over to the FBI for analysis; the FBI declined to comment."

As time goes by, it proves to be more and more difficult to locate and bring Jussie Smollett‘s attackers to justice.

On Monday, per TMZ, the Empire actor turned in copies of his phone records to Chicago PD, which are a crucial part in the ongoing investigation of the alleged brutal attack on his life two weeks ago.

But according to law enforcement, the copies were excused as evidence due to the fact that they were heavily altered!

Related: Man Who Reported Jussie Smollett’s Attack To Police Recalls The ‘Scary Night’

As we reported, Jussie said he was on the phone with his manager and creative director Frank Gatson shortly after leaving a Subway restaurant when the attack happened. It was Gatson who later convinced the 35-year-old to report the incident to police.

Proof of the call between these two, where racial and homophobic slurs made by the assailants were reportedly overheard, is what police were hoping to find and confirm. Per sources connected to TMZ, the PDFs submitted were reportedly heavily ‘redacted’ and therefore not eligible for use as evidence.

Although the police did point out that there’s no evidence that the specific phone record in question was actually manipulated, the problem here is that the fact that it was edited at all.



Ugh, how unfortunate… especially since police haven’t been able to identify the attackers from nearby surveillance footage. Police say there are cameras everywhere in the area of Jussie’s building, but there is reportedly a 60-second gap in the video where you don’t see him at all.

Could a direct download of his actual phone do the trick? Hmm…we have to wonder why the full records weren’t submitted to begin with.

Our thoughts continue to be with Jussie in the aftermath of it all.

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager when he was attacked, but he initially refused a police request to hand over his phone records, Page Six reported.

While he did provide them Monday, the records were “limited and redacted,” according to WLS.

“We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation. However, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, calling the redactions “extreme.”

Police are likely to require more information from Smollett, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the two men shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the actor, before they put a noose around his neck and doused him with a chemical. Police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Smollett also claimed the attackers referenced Trump’s MAGA slogan.

Police said standard investigatory procedure requires independent verification of the phone call that allegedly took place during the attack.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Guglielmi said.

Police said they have examined surveillance cameras in the area of the alleged attack, but have yet to see any evidence that what Smollett described took place.

However, the cameras did not record every part of Smollett’s walk through the neighborhood where he was attacked.

Smollett’s spokesperson said the actor was the victim in the incident and should be treated as such.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the spokesperson’s statement read.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

Or was he, a bunch of very dumb and cruel and cynical people are now asking?!?

As you've very likely heard about and/or read all about by now, the Empire star was harassed by a pair of assailants late last month on his way home from getting a late-night snack.

These individuals allegedly screamed homophobic and racist epithets at the actor, prior to tying a rope around his neck and dumping bleach all over him.

It was the epitome of a hate crime.

It was a modern-day lynching.

It was truly horrible.

And yet... despite police confirming the assault... and despite Smollett certainly having no reason to lie about such a thing... a handful of people out there somehow don't believe this heinous incident actually took place.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same high-rise near the Navy Pier as Smollett.

On what is he basing this strong allegation?

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black,"" Muhammad explained to Page Six.

Elsewhere, a patron at Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub - located approximately a block from the scene of the alleged assault - said Smollett’s story “doesn’t really make sense,"" expounding as follows:

“It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said this unnamed man. ""They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?”

This is quite the take.

For starters, there is surveillance footage (below) of two men spotted right around the time and right around the place Smollett says he was attacked.

Secondly, yes, Hillary Clinton won Cook County (which includes Chicago) with 75% of the vote in the 2016 Presidential campaign.

That's a huge margin of victory over Donald Trump.

But it still means 25% of residents voted to Make America Great Again, making it mathmatically very plausible that two of those people screamed that Smollett is in ""MAGA Country"" while they pummelled him, which is what the actor has claimed.

Smollett will soon start filming episodes of Empire once again, while he returned to the stage for a live singing performance just days after the incident.

""I am not fully healed yet, but I'm going to, and I'm gonna stand strong with ya'll,"" the actor/singer said during a concert at the Troubadour club on the Sunset Strip.

He added at the time:

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those motherf-ckers win. So I will always stand for love.

""I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love and I hope that you all stand with me.""

Elsewhere, Smollett has been asked to turn over his phone records to the police because he has said he was on the phone with his manager at the time of his assault.

Authorities therefore consider these records important evidence for the case.

However, TMZ reports that Smollett has responded by turning over a redacted PDF of his phone bill.

And police have requested the full, actual phone bill -- or a download of Jussie's phone; they say a PDF can be manipulated and cannot be used as any sort of evidence.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says.

As for those who are casting doubt on Smollet's story?

His spokesperson says the following:

Jussie is the victim here, which has been slated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.

Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible.

Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.

We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice."

Chicago Police Department asked for a copy of Jussie's phone bill to authenticate that the call occurred, receiving the PDF yesterday.

A rep for the actor told TMZ: ""Jussie is the victim here, which has been slated by the Superintendent of Police.

""Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.

""Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible.

""Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.

""We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice.""

Police are yet to find any CCTV footage of Jussie's attack, which is being treated as a hate crime.

Jussie previously said that he was attacked shortly after arriving in Chicago from New York for filming.

The actor, who plays Jamal Lyon in drama series Empire, was walking back from Subway in the early hours of the morning when two unknown assailants are said to have yelled both homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him up while shouting: ""This is a MAGA [Make America Great Again] country.""

At one point, a rope was tied around Jussie's neck and an unknown substance - reported to be bleach - was poured onto his skin.

Jussie was previously forced to hit back at conspiracy theories surrounding the attack, with residents from the same Chicago neighbourhood casting doubt over his report.

One neighbour, Agin Muhammad, previously told the New York Post: ""I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did.

""I’ve been in this neighbourhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here... Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Carla Hayden has just named two judges at the Copyright Royalty Board.

The Librarian of Congress has confirmed a major appointment.

Carla Hayden has selected Judge Jesse Feder as the new Chief Copyright Royalty Judge. He’ll also serve as Head of the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB).

Feder will replace outgoing Chief Judge Suzanne Barnett, who will retire from federal service on February 16th. She had served in the position since 2012.

In a statement, Hayden expressed her gratitude for Feder’s years of service at the CRB and at the Library of Congress. He has provided “expertise, insight, and institutional knowledge,” making him the perfect candidate.

Hayden also thanked Barnett for her dedication and able service over the past 7 years.

Feder currently serves as a judge on the CRB. He has over 25 years of experience in copyright and intellectual property law. Feder has previously served as Director of International Trade and Intellectual Property for the Business Software Alliance. Other positions include Acting Associate Register at the U.S. Copyright Office, and Legal Adviser in the Office of the General Counsel for the Library of Congress.

The Librarian of Congress has also confirmed another appointment.

To fill Feder’s vacancy, Hayden has named Richard C. Strasser as Interim Copyright Royalty Judge. He’ll serve for a period of six months, or until Hayden fills the position permanently. She’ll post the position of Copyright Royalty Judge within the next few weeks.

Strasser has served as Senior Staff Attorney at the CRB since its inception in 2007. He has broad experience in economics and finance. At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Strasser served as Attorney Fellow for several years. He focused primarily on market structure and derivatives. Strasser has also published articles dealing with economic and financial analysis.

Speaking about Strasser’s interim appointment, Hayden said,

“I extend my gratitude to Judge Strasser for being willing once again to serve in this important role. “His service will enable the Board to continue its important work uninterrupted while we recruit a permanent replacement.”

Chicago Police have been requesting Jussie’s phone records from him since the day of his attack. According to Page Six, it took the Empire star 13 days to finally hand over to the cops the information that they were looking for. Police wanted Smollett’s phone records as he had claimed that he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack.

But now that he has finally turned over the records that the Chicago Police have been asking for, they are calling the records “limited and redacted” — as well as insufficient to use for part of a police investigation. The CPD called the records a “heavily redacted” PDF version of his call log, and Chicago Police Spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that they are going to need something more “concrete and direct” if they want to prove that the conversation actually took place. Redacted records are not able to be used because they are able to be tampered with.

“We don’t believe this is the case at all but when anyone hands over a redacted and limited record like a PDF of a phone bill for example, those records could be manipulated,” Guglielmi said. “We don’t believe they are but we have to be able to hold up to the standards of a criminal court… [the records] don’t meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

However, Guglielmi still says that Smollett should be considered a victim — and that he’s glad he followed through on getting the records over to police. For now, he says, the investigation will continue. As the Inquisitr reported, Smollett was reportedly subjected to racist and homophobic insults during an attack which saw two masked men throw an unknown chemical substance at him near his Chicago high-rise.

Additionally, the men allegedly put a rope around his neck before they fled the scene. There is also a surveillance video of Jussie walking into his apartment building with a rope around his neck. Police have also released video of two men walking in the area prior to the attack, and are asking for the public’s help in identifying them.

Smollett’s family has also released a statement on the attack, calling it “a racial, homophobic hate crime.” To end the statement, the Smollett family said that they will continue to work toward “love, equity, and justice.”

So far, police do not have anyone in custody, but are working to piece together the details of that evening."

A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department told ET on Tuesday that detectives rejected the cell phone records the Empire star submitted via PDF one day earlier because they were heavily redacted.

According to police, a PDF is subject to manipulation, but they are not saying they have any evidence that Smollett manipulated his phone records -- detectives have now asked Smollett to submit his actual phone bill or a download of his entire phone. Police also told ET that detectives had recently obtained surveillance video from stores in the area where the attack happened to see if anyone bought rope around the time the incident occurred.

As the investigation continues, Smollett is still cooperating with detectives, and authorities are continuing to treat the actor as the victim of a hate crime, the spokesperson added.

RELATED: Jussie Smollett Finally Turns Phone Records Over To Cops

Earlier today we reported that Jussie Smollett finally turned in his phone records to police from his horrific attack, however, police state that they are not sufficient.

TMZ reports that Law enforcement sources reveal that Jussie turned in records that were actually from two weeks after his alleged attack.

They add that the PDF is subject to manipulation, meaning numbers can be added or deleted, although police clarify that there’s no evidence they were in fact tampered with.

A rep for Jussie told TMZ, “Jussie is the victim here, which has been slated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.” “Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

As we reported, Jussie claimed that he called his manager during the attack and the manager says he heard the racial and homophobic slurs. Therefore, Chicago police wants the phone records to prove that a call was made. They initially requested the records two weeks ago."

The phone records Jussie Smollett provided to cops to corroborate his version of his alleged attack are “limited and redacted” and insufficient for a criminal investigation, the Chicago Police Department said Tuesday.

Smollett turned over the records 13 days after his alleged assault — following a report in The Post that he was holding them back — but they were a “heavily redacted” PDF of his call log from within an hour of the attack at 11:28 PST Monday, a spokesperson for the “Empire” star and Chicago police said.

“We need something a little more concrete and direct if we’re going to be able to say for a fact the conversation occurred,” Chicago police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told The Post in reference to a conversation Smollett said he had with his manager at the time of the attack.

“We don’t believe this is the case at all, but when anyone hands over a redacted and limited record like a PDF of a phone bill, for example, those records could be manipulated. We don’t believe they are, but we have to be able to hold up to the standards of a criminal court … [the records] don’t meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

Chris Bastardi, a spokesperson for Jussie Smollett, said the redacted information “was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

“Chicago Police have not told us that they are rejecting any records, nor have they expressed concerns about the records to us,” Bastardi went on.

Late Tuesday morning, Guglielmi was unable to confirm if detectives had told Smollett’s team the records were insufficient.

Smollett told police he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the alleged racist and homophobic attack he endured on Jan. 29. Smollett said he was called “f—-t” and “n—-r” and heard the words “MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Moore said he overheard those remarks during the phone call and police want the phone records to corroborate the men’s accounts of what happened.

“We obviously can’t use redacted records, we have to have the whole record to show it wasn’t tampered with at all,” Guglielmi said.

Still, Guglielmi said the records Smollett provided are indicative of his willingness to cooperate and the department will be following up with Smollett’s team for additional data.

“He committed early on to getting those records and he followed through with that,” Guglielmi said.

“He’s very much still considered a victim and the investigation continues.”"

According to TMZ, Smollett offered up PDF copies of his phone records — which were also said to be heavily redacted — but the Chicago, Illinois Police Depatrment was forced to reject them due to PDFs are not a valid form of submission for evidence due to their ability to be manipulated.

He will have to resubmit the original records by way of physical phone bill or a download of his actual phone contents.

The outlet goes on to note that Smollett claimed he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack, but that security footage outside the building where he claims the attack took place contains a one-minute gap where the actor is not visible.

At this time, no footage of the attack appears to exist, but police have said that Smollett has been very cooperative and that they are treating the situation as a hate crime.

The Empire star recently opened up about the attack in a statement to Essence, wherein he explained how he is doing in the days since.

""Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett's statement began. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""

He then went on to speak about rumors that he had changed his story following the attack, and that there were inconsistencies in his recollection of it.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,"" the actor stated

“As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he went on to say. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.”

Finally, Smollett concluded his statement by signing it, ""With Love, respect & honor... Jussie.""

The Empire actor has finally handed over his records although they have been heavily redacted.

Page Six reports:

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the “Empire” star said in an email, 13 days after Smollett alleged he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.

“They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST].”

Cops requested Smollett’s phone records to corroborate a call he said he had with his manager Brandon Z. Moore during the attack.

Both Smollett and Moore issued statements that the men linked to the attack allegedly called Smollet homophobic and racial slurs while carrying out their assault. Authorities are examining the records to line up the accuracy of the statements.

“We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation,” Chicago Police Department chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi told ITK in a statement Tuesday. “However the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation, as they were limited and heavily redacted.”

The “Empire” star and singer told police last month that he was assaulted by two men who placed a rope around his neck and beat him with their fists. Smollett also alleged that the two men, who were wearing masks, poured an unknown substance on him.

In a later interview with police, Smollett said the suspects shouted the pro-Trump phrase “MAGA country” during the ambush.

“Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police,” a spokesman for the actor said in a statement to ITK. “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

The spokesman added: ""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.”

Police had requested phone records from Smollett as part of their investigation. The 35-year-old entertainer had reportedly told authorities that he was on the phone with his manager just before the early-morning attack.

“Detectives may be following up with the victim to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline,” Guglielmi said Tuesday.

Chicago Police also told ITK that there are no updates about possible suspects in the case.

During the discussion, Lemon spoke about what it was like coming out to his mother, the reaction he initially got from Black women who took issue with his sexuality, and dating Black men who were afraid to live their lives out of the closet.

Check out the highlights from the interview, in the video below.

The challenges of being a gay, Black man

First of all, we were slaves. We were beaten and branded. And so as Black, gay men, we carry the racism part and the gay part. We’re already a class of people who have been discriminated against. So why would I want to add another mark? Sometimes, some of us say, we’re too Black to be gay and some of us say, we’re too gay to be Black…So, you got it from your own folks or from the larger community…and then you get it from your sisters who are like, ‘Well, why not me?’ And it’s like, ‘I love you but I don’t love you.’

Coming out to his mom

I came out to my mom when I was 30 because I was dealing with a breakup. moved to New York City so I could be me. And I met my boyfriend, started living together and then we broke up. And I was heartbroken. And she was like, ‘What’s wrong with you? You’re not my son. What is happening? Why are you so sad?’ And I told her, because of my relationship. She said, ‘What relationship?’ I said, ‘With John.’ She said, ‘What kind of relationship?’ I said, ‘He was my lover.’ And I just started crying and it came out on the phone. And she was very quiet. But very accepting. She goes, ‘You’re my son. I’m going to love you no matter. what. I’m your mom, I’m always going to love you.’

And that meant the world to me to have— the hardest thing, I could tell anybody else but I couldn’t tell my mom.

Jada: Why was that? Why was that so difficult?

Don: Well, you know the relationships Black women have with their sons.

Jada: Laughs. That’s real talk!

Don: I want my momma to be proud of me. Every day, when I step into that suit and I got on the set, I’m there for me, God, but I’m there for my mom. Because I know, if nobody’s watching, she’s watching. And I know if nobody’s going to call me, she is. Nobody’s going to come visit me, she is. If I don’t have a dollar, she’s going to give me one. That is the only person in the world—and my sister—that is going to be there. And I thought, if I tell my mom this and she turns her back on me, I don’t have a friend in the world. My best friend is gone. And so, when she said that, free. Nothing else mattered after that.

But the weird thing, once she became comfortable with it and I started being myself again, she told me that she didn’t want me to be gay. She wanted to have grandkids. She wanted to get married. She had been confiding in her friends and they were talking about it. And then it was a long journey and she came around. She needed her process. Now, she’s at the house, she’s cooking with my boyfriend and his family. We’re all at Christmas together.

Having to hide when he was hanging around Black people

I was hiding my identity from everyone. So I would sneak off with my friends, most of them were White because it was easier for them to be out. So I would go out with them and I could be free in what they called “alternative clubs.” We’d be dancing in the clubs and there weren’t a lot of people who looked like me. And so when I wanted to hang out with the folks that looked like me, I had to be straight. I had to have a girlfriend because they didn’t accept it. I just said enough is enough. And I said whatever happens from here, this is who I am. And you talk about emancipation. I am completely emancipated. I have no secrets. I wish every Black gay man could have that experience, especially my Black brothers and sisters. Because so many of them get shunned.

I think it has a lot to do with the church. Because remember, we relied on the church a lot coming out of slavery. Because God changes things. The church was the center of our universe. It’s how we communicated, it’s where we drew strength. And I think because of the teachings of the church, that people feel that it’s against God and that it’s a sin.

Those same doctrines and scriptures that they used to keep Black folks enchained are the same ones they’re using to discriminate against gay people. And you as a person of color who has been discriminated against, you have to wake up.

Dating Black men who weren’t ready to be out

They want the experience. It’s almost like cultural appropriation. Like, ‘I want to do—but I don’t really want to live that way forever.’ I want to have the fun, after a few drinks…but you don’t want to actually show up at my house with a rose and say, ‘Are we having dinner tonight?’ You can’t deal with that part. But you want to do the other part. And you guys all know what we’re talking about. You don’t want to deal with romance and the reality of building a life together, or a home and a future together.

Sometimes, if you date someone who’s not of your race there are a lot of White guys out there, who love Black guys. They love sleeping with them…

Jada: But they don’t want to bring them home. I’ve dated White in the past and I know that your current partner is White… how is that?

Gammy: I understand that love is love but I have always found it very difficult because I just don’t think that our understanding and the experiences that we have are the same. And so there’s an inability to truly relate. Now, I’ve not been in an interracial relationship of any kind. That’s just my own thinking.

Don: You’re right. The experiences are different. And we do have disagreements about it. We do have discussion about it. But when you’re in love with someone, it’s never easy. But when you’re truly committed to someone who’s a good person, then you want to work those things out. I don’t expect him to know what it is to be a Black man. You can’t expect me to know what it’s like to be a woman but I can empathize my sister. I can take your word for the experiences that you have and go along with you for the journey. Sometimes, I just have to say ‘Take my word for it.’

When I’m with the Black men that I’ve dated, they get it. But you know what? Most of ‘em aren’t out. Most of them didn’t want people to know. I’m not about that life anymore. And I’m not saying you have to live your life that way, that’s not the way I want to live my life. And if someone doesn’t like me for who or what I am, that’s their problem."

Just in time for Valentine's Day and ahead of the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, Drunk History is celebrating one of the most important love stories in LGBTQ history.

The latest episode of Comedy Central's hit series features the story of Edith ""Edie"" Windsor and Thea Spyer, two lesbians from New York whose marriage became a focal point in the fight against the Defense of Marriage Act and helped same-sex marriage become legal across America in 2013. Sugar Lyn Beard plays Windsor and Alison Brie plays Spyer, and the story is (drunkenly) narrated by Alison Rich and Kirby Howell-Baptiste.

""The year is 1950; the place is the United States of A,"" Rich says. ""At this point in history, it's not even legal to dance closely to a person of the same sex. So Edie Windsor was a young lesbian, and she's like, 'Ooh, I gotta keep my personal life private, 'cause this is the past, and the past is close-minded.'""

""I'm talking about gay stuff,"" she adds, cracking up.

The episode tells the story of how Windsor and Spyer met, bonded over their love of dancing and fell in love, despite having to keep their relationship a secret. But after the Stonewall Riots on June 28, 1969, Windsor began to wonder if they should come out publicly as a show of support for the LGBTQ community.

In Rich's retelling, the women were reluctant to become revolutionaries and remained privately in love for the next 30 years; but near the end of Spyer's life in 2007, they decided to officially get married in Canada, where same-sex marriage was recently legalized. After Spyer's death in 2009, however, the American government refused to recognize their marriage and ordered Windsor to pay nearly half a million dollars in estate taxes. Windsor's fight to have her marriage recognized turned her into a hero for the queer community.

""When push came to shove, being who they were was revolutionary,"" Rich told The Advocate. ""In this day and age, I think it's really great that people are being more motivated to get more active politically, but it can also be super overwhelming. Knowing that taking the small step of being who you are, maybe not to the whole world but to your family or on your micro-level can make a lot of change.""

She says it was an uplifting experience to tell this story in the midst of all the recent pushback against the LGBTQ community, and an important reminder that rights so recently won by marginalized people can slip away if activists don't keep fighting for them.

""So many people that I love who identify as LGBT [are] so brave, and it's important to stand in solidarity with them. I think it's easy to think these battles are done and won and there's no more work to do, but at this cultural moment we're seeing more than ever, like with what happened to Jussie Smollett, there's still work to be done. An anniversary like Stonewall is a reminder that we can't get complacent. These rights are so important, and not everybody agrees with that. We need to keep celebrating these moments.""

Drunk History creator Derek Waters told reporters at a Comedy Central press event last month that it's important that everyone remembers Edie Windsor's story.

""We need to know about her. We need to know what they went through to fight for gay marriage, and how important it is. No matter what race or sex you are, this is really important. It's love. Let people be in love. If you don't, we're done.""

The 52-year-old CNN anchor stopped by the latest episode of Red Table Talk and discussed the recent homophobic and racist attack against the Empire star, in which, according to a source, two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett before repeatedly hitting him. The men then poured a substance on him -- believed to be bleach, according to the source -- and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck.

""My initial reaction was sadness. I wasn't shocked. I didn't like that it happened to him,"" Lemon, who came out publicly in 2011, said. ""I called him because we have mutual friends. I got the friend on the phone, the friend talked to me for a minute. The friend goes, 'Jussie's here seeing the doctor.' And I talked to Jussie for a minute and then he said, 'I gotta go, the doctor's here.' And it just made me sad.""

Lemon has remained singularly focused on Smollett's well-being since the attack.

""It's been reported this happened or that happened, but my main concern is for him and for his well-being,"" Lemon said. ""... One, he has to deal with discrimination as a black man, then, on top of that, he has to be gay and he's out. And then fame.""

""Fame is not natural. I don't think people were meant to be famous,"" he continued. ""... When something happens and it's controversial, everyone is coming for you. And so I knew everyone would be picking apart his story. It's not for me. That's not my concern. My concern is for him.""

That concern has led Lemon to check in on Smollett every day with text messages.

""So every day I say... 'I know you think I'm annoying you, but I just want to know how you're doing. And that you're OK. And that if you need somebody you can talk to me because there's not a lot of us out there,'"" Lemon revealed. ""Sometimes he responds, sometimes he doesn't. He responded and said, 'You are not annoying.'""

Smollett's attack is one of many things of late that's led Lemon to be fearful in his life as a gay black man.

""I've had fear recently because of the political environment. I get death threats... I have security,"" Lemon said. ""All of these things that happen. Listen, we've always been divided ideologically, but there's something different going on now.""

Prior to the latest Red Table Talk episode, Jada Pinkett Smith, the show's host, told ET's Kevin Frazier why she invited Lemon on the Facebook Watch Series.

""Don [Lemon] is on this week, and with the whole Jussie Smollett situation that has occurred, my mother and Willow and I were very interested in the experience of being openly gay, black and male in America,"" she explained. ""That's a very short list, and the only person I could think of to bring to the table to talk about that experience is Don.""

""Don came with so much wisdom and so much information, and he really enlightened me about what the experience is like and in a way that I really didn't get or understand before I talked to Don,"" she continued. ""I hope people who have family members or have children, families that are struggling with figuring out how to deal with a child that's openly gay, or people who are trying to figure out how to talk about it, will watch the show.""

The Chicago Police Department has claimed that the records supplied to them by Jussie Smollett to prove he was on the phone with his manager when he was attacked are heavily redacted and insufficient as evidence of the call.

In the latest development in a series of back-and-forths between the Empire star and the authorities, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Monday that Smollett, 36, had not given enough proof that he was talking to Brandon Z. Moore when he was jumped on January 29.

'We continue to investigate but the records are insufficient to corroborate some of the information.

'We appreciate the cooperation but will be following up for some additional data,' Guglielmi told DailyMail.com.

TMZ reports that Smollett gave a redacted, PDF print-out of a bill but police would not confirm that detail on Tuesday morning.

They also would not confirm whether or not they planned to ask the cell phone company for the records they say he is withholding.

It comes a day after Smollett's representative hit out at the department for revealing that he had not, until yesterday morning, handed over any phone records to support his story.

Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack Jussie Smollett's representative

On Tuesday, a spokesman for the star said he had redacted the phone records to 'protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack'.

'Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police.'

He added that the star had not even been told that what he gave over was insufficient and that he would not be 'baited' into 'uncorroborated press reports' despite the department spokesman going on the record on Tuesday with his comments.

The police department would not say what further proof of the call it needed.

Smollett and his manager Brandon Z. Moore are pictured. Brandon claimed to have heard Smollett's attackers calling him 'Empire f****t n***r' and shouting 'This is MAGA country!'

The Chicago Tribune Star reports that not only were the phone records that he provided redacted, but that Moore, the manager on the other end of the call, had only provided a screenshot of his phone which showed a record of it the conversation.

Moore declined repeated offers to speak to DailyMail.com last month and did not immediately respond to inquiries on Tuesday morning.

Yesterday, in his statement, Smollett's representative hit out at the suggestion that he was not cooperating by not giving unfettered access to his phone.

'Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. These types of false stories are wrong and damaging to the investigation.

'Jussie has provided his phone records and multiple statements to police, and Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible.

'Any reports to the contrary are simply false and misrepresent the Chicago Police Superintendent’s remarks regarding the status of the investigation.

'Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice,' they said in a statement.

A week before the attack, Smollett received this threatening letter at the Fox studio where he works

Chicago Police Department has said in repeated statements that he has been cooperative but that they have not been able to find video footage of the attack or confirm the phone call.

Moore claims to have heard Smollett's attackers calling him 'Empire f****t n****r' and shouting: 'This is MAGA country!' after allegedly attacking him, hitting him, putting a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him.

Smollett was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop when he was attacked by two men.

He said one was wearing a mask and he could not identify the other.

The actor was picked up by surveillance cameras walking out of the Subway and was picked back up entering his building with a rope around his neck but so far no video of the attack has been found.

His friend, 60-year-old Frank Gatson, was in his apartment when he got home and he was who called the police.

Smollett did not want to involve the authorities but Gatson insisted."

Smollett has turned over heavily redacted phone records, but evidence has begun to emerge suggesting his story was fabricated. Rumors are swirling that police are even considering charging him with filing a false report.

On Monday night, Fox 32 Chicago anchor Rafer Weigel reported that police “received cell phone records today from Smollett’s camp. They were limited and redacted but detectives will analyze them.”

Weigel had previously reported that the police superintendent plans to hold Smollett accountable if the investigation reveals he made a false report. “[Chicago Police Superintendent] Eddie Johnson says [Jussie Smollett] is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable,” he tweeted. That threat seems more likely.

Late Monday evening, ABC7 Chicago reported that an empty hot sauce bottle that smelled like bleach was found near the location of the alleged attack. Smollett had told police that the attackers — who wore “Make America Great Again” hats and screamed “This is MAGA country!” — had poured an unknown bleach-smelling liquid on him and put a noose around his neck after they yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him at 2 a.m. on January 29.

Chicago police confirmed a New York Post story about the hot sauce bottle.

“It’s unclear if that is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvasses but we took it for analysis,” Chicago Police Department (CPD) spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “The FBI is providing CPD with technical assistance on this case at our request. I’m not sure if the bottle went to their lab or one of ours.”

As for the phone records, Guglielmi said, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation, however, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Chicago police have not been able to identify any legitimate suspects in the case, nor have they been able to find any surveillance footage of the attack. There is speculation that the hot sauce bottle may have been placed after the fact to prop up the hoax if Smollett indeed made a false report.

Some locals smell a rat.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” Chicago resident Agin Muhammad told the New York Post. Muhammad reportedly lives in the same high-rise as Smollett.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here…. Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

In “Empire,” Smollett plays a gay character, Jamal Lyon. The actor has also come out as gay.

Many Americans are waking up to the possibility that Jussie Smollett’s story may be a hoax. Jeff Giesea, an entrepreneur who has written for NATO and the Harvard Business Review, tweeted, “The weight of evidence supports what we’ve suspected all along: This is a hate hoax. [Jussie Smollett] should be arrested for filing a false police report & sued. In this era of disinfo, these hoaxes and their media enablers must be held accountable.”

Conservative blogger Matt Walsh laid out the basic incongruity of Smollett’s story: “he claims he was attacked by white Trump-loving racists in one of the most liberal parts of one of the most liberal cities in America. No similar attacks have been reported by anyone in the town.”

So here's where we are on the Jussie Smollett story: he claims he was attacked by white Trump-loving racists in one of the most liberal parts of one of the most liberal cities in America. No similar attacks have been reported by anyone in the town. — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 12, 2019

“He’s on camera walking down the street. There is only a 60 second gap where he is not on camera, he claims the attack just so happened to occur during that gap,” Walsh continued. “But cameras don’t pick up anyone fitting the description of the suspects. If they exist, they must have vanished into thin air. Also, Smollett claims he was on the phone during the attack but didn’t want to turn his phone over to police.”

“Finally he did turn his phone records over, but redacted them so heavily as to make them useless. Oh and his own neighbors think the story is totally bogus,” Walsh added. “If this guy wasn’t a celebrity, police would have already charged him with filing a false report. The story was clearly bogus from the get go, and only became more bogus with each new revelation.”

The story so far is that Smollett was walking home when he was jumped by two men shouting homophobic and racist slurs at him, soaking him in an unknown liquid believed to be bleach, and slipping a thin rope around his neck in the form of a noose. During the attack, they reportedly shouted: “Welcome to MAGA country.”

So far, police have found no evidence of Smollett’s “redneck” attackers on the many video cameras around the area Smollett walked. There is a single gap of 60 seconds within the coverage, and this is where Smollett claims the attack took place.

He also claimed he was on the phone with his manager Brandon Z when the attack happened, so naturally, police asked him to turn over his phone in order to further the investigation. Initially, Smollett refused to, saying he needed his phone. After some time, he finally relented and gave police the device.

As expected, police aren’t really impressed with what Smollett handed over, which are “limited and redacted,” causing police to ask for the full records according to ABC 7 Chicago’s Rob Elgas.

“UPDATE: After Jussie Smollett turned over ‘limited & redacted’ phone records, Chicago police spokesman @AJGuglielmi tells @ABC7Chicago ‘We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation…'” tweeted Eglas.

“MORE: Chicago police spokesman says ‘Detectives may be following up with him (Smollett) to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline,'” he added.

While police are officially still considering Smollett a victim of a hate crime, doubt has begun creeping in. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson warned that if Smollett is found to have filed a false report there will be consequences.

As it stands, this is looking more and more like another claim of right-wing hate with no proof intended for the media to run with. The media took the bait for sure, making a huge deal out of Smollett’s attack, but once again it seems that the media jumped the gun in order to foster their narrative that Trump supporters are every kind of horrible they say they are."

Just after the NY Post reported that Jussie Smollett had not turned over his phone records to police, it seems that, actually, the Empire actor has given them to authorities.

As previously reported, police needed to confirm Smollett’s horrific account of having been on the phone with his manager while he was attacked in a racist and homophobic assault, purportedly carried out by MAGA supporters. According to Page Six, Smollett turned over the data on Monday morning, as a spokesperson for the actor stated via email:

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt. They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST].”

Along with their report that Smollett had not turned over his phone records, the NY Post called attention to neighbors who were “skeptical” about the story the actor told authorities.

Don Lemon has opened up about how difficult it is to be black and openly gay in the US.

Speaking on Facebook Watch show Red Table Talk on Monday (February 11), the openly gay CNN news anchor explained: “First of all, we were slaves. We were beaten and branded.

“So as black, gay men, we carry the racism part and we carry the gay part.”

Watch Don Lemon on Red Table Talk:



Lemon, who came out publicly in 2011, explained to hosts—Jada Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow and mother Adrienne, “We’re already a class of people who have been discriminated against, so why do I want to have another mark against me?”

“Some of us say we’re too black to be gay. Or are we too gay to be black?” — Don Lemon

“Historically, black men have stayed in the closet. You have to decide your identity: Do I want to be black? Or do I want to be gay?

“And sometimes, some of us say we’re too black to be gay. Or are we too gay to be black?”

Lemon said that as a gay, black man, discrimination could come from all sides.

“You get it from your own folks or from the larger community,” Lemon told the hosts. “And you’re worried about your job, will you be able to advance?

“And you get it from your sisters, who are like: ‘Why not me?'”

Don Lemon tearfully reveals how he came out to his mum

Lemon, 52, revealed to the presenters that he came out to his mum when he was 30, after a painful breakup.

“I just started crying, and it came out on the phone, and she was very quiet—but very accepting. She said: ‘I’m your mum. I’m going to love you no matter what.

“‘I’m your mum, I’m always going to love you.'”

He teared up as he continued: “That meant the world to me. The hardest thing was: I could tell anyone else. But I couldn’t tell my mother.”

After that, Lemon said, he was “free. Nothing else mattered after that.”

Don Lemon discusses attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett

Lemon said he was saddened but not shocked by the suspected racial and homophobic attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett last month, which led to Smollett being hospitalised.

He told the hosts: “I wasn’t shocked. I didn’t like that it happened to him. My concern is for him and for his well-being.

“On top of having to deal with discrimination as a black man, he’s gay and he’s out, and then, fame. And fame is not natural. I don’t think people were meant to be famous,” the CNN anchor added.

Lemon also revealed that he had exchanged text messages with Smollett since the attack.

He said he told the actor: “I know you think I’m annoying, but I just want to know how you’re doing and that you’re okay. If you need somebody, you can talk to me, because there’s not a lot of us out there.

“Sometimes he responds, sometimes he doesn’t. When he responds, he says: ‘You are not annoying.'”"

11:20 AM PT -- As for the redacted information, the rep says, ""Any redacted information was intended to protect the privacy of personal contacts or high-profile individuals not relevant to the attack.

10:15 AM PT -- A rep for Jussie tells us, ""Jussie is the victim here, which has been stated by the Superintendent of Police. Jussie has voluntarily provided his phone records from within an hour of the attack and given multiple statements to police. Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible.""

The rep continues, ""Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie's attackers and bring them to justice.""

Jussie Smollett's submitted critical phone records to Chicago police, but those records have been rejected because they're not the real deal.

Law enforcement sources tell us ... what Jussie turned in 2 weeks after his alleged attack was a heavily redacted PDF file of his phone bill. Our sources say a PDF is subject to manipulation, meaning numbers can be added or deleted, although police are quick to point out there's no evidence they were in fact manipulated. The problem ... the only solid, irrefutable evidence is either the actual phone bill or a download of Jussie's phone.

As we reported, Jussie says he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack and the manager says he heard the racial and homophobic epithets. Chicago PD wants the phone records to authenticate a call was made. They asked Jussie for the records 2 weeks ago and received the PDF Monday.

Police say there are cameras everywhere in the area of Jussie's building, but there is still a 60-second gap in the video where you don't see the ""Empire"" star. So far there's no video of the attack.

Our sources say police have also retrieved security video from nearby stores to see if anybody bought rope around the time of the incident. Police are reviewing the video.

Police say Jussie remains cooperative and they are treating him as the victim of a hate crime.

As you know, Jussie says his attackers tied a rope around his neck ... police say there's video of Jussie with a rope around his neck in the lobby. They are not saying if the rope is around his neck outside the building because they say that would interfere with the investigation."

Jussie Smollett, the Empire star who was attacked in Chicago late last January, has had his case run into some snags, according to recent reports.

You may recall that Smollett allegedly had bleach poured on him and a noose put around his neck in a 2 a.m. attack on Tuesday, January 29.

Just last week, Chicago Police stated that Smollett had refused to turn over his phone so investigators could download and examine its data for clues.

The New York Post reports:

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that Smollett, 36, was being treated as a crime victim, but would be held accountable if cops learn he filed a false report.

The Post found a hot sauce bottle filled with clear, bleach-scented liquid near the location of Smollett’s alleged attack and had authorities collect it as potential evidence.

Smollett did eventually turn over his phone. However, The Chicago Tribune reports, “A spokesman for police Superintendent Eddie Johnson by late evening said that the records ‘are not sufficient and do not meet the burden of a criminal investigation,’ and that police may require more assistance from the actor.”

Smollett was allegedly talking to his manager on his phone at the time of the attack.

Although there were also reports of threatening hate mail being sent to the TV actor, the FBI is investigating the hate mail and the police are investigating the attack as separate incidents, The Chicago Tribune says.

Reporters from the New York Post, reportedly found an empty bottle with a bleach odor after retracing Jussie Smollett‘s path the night of the attack. However, the Chicago Police Department is not sure if the bottle is “related” to the attack.

ABC 7 in Chicago reports, “The hot sauce bottle was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach, according to a New York Post story confirmed by Chicago police. The Post claimed they found it near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews.”

However, the Chicago Police Department appears to be dismissing the evidence because they didn’t find it, “It’s unclear if that is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvasses but we took it for analysis. The FBI is providing CPD with technical assistance on this case at our request. I’m not sure if the bottle went to their lab or one of ours.”

The Chicago Police Department also said Monday afternoon that the 36-year-old actor submitted his phone records but it was “limited and redacted” from within an hour of the alleged incident. The CPD also said in a statement, “We are very appreciative of the victims cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later, there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “refused” to give the cops his phone. All of these inconsistent reports have prompted some to say Smollett fabricated the attack. Now the new neighbor and the man at the bar will create more suspicion.

Just yesterday, we reported an unidentified person who was a patron at an Irish bar a block from the scene of the alleged attack, said: “It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around. They have cameras everywhere. . . Why can’t they find the attack?”

Clearly, that anonymous person is delusional, since incidents like the Laquan McDonald murder to 15 men exonerated for false arrests show Chicago is far from “the most liberal city,” which has an epic history of racism.

On Jan. 9, while walking to a subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited the restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a week before. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

Hopefully, the Chicago Police Department is taking this case with the seriousness it deserves.

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police, Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the actor said in an email.

The Chicago PD also confirmed this in a statement Monday.

“Chicago Police received limited and redacted phone records from the victim. These records will be analyzed by detectives and we will be in contact with the victim should additional information be needed.”

“Usually when we ask people to hand over their records, they just hand over their phone,” Chicago PD spokesman Howard Ludwig said.

Here’s the rub. According to the Chicago Tribune, a spokesperson for police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the records “are not sufficient and do not meet the burden of a criminal investigation.” The spokesperson added that police might require additional information from Smollett.

As we previously reported, cops requested Smollett’s phone records to confirm his statement that he was on a call with his manager Brandon Z. Moore during the attack. Both allege the actor was called a “f—-t” and a “n—-r” and Moore insists he also heard the assailants yell “MAGA country.”

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Post on Sunday.

Smollett was allegedly attacked last month in Chicago by two masked males who doused him with bleach and tied a noose around his neck. He reportedly transported himself to a local hospital and was released hours later in “good condition.”

Meanwhile, New York Post reports that two weeks after Smollett made headlines for being the victim of an alleged hate crime, his neighbors are speaking out and they’re not buying his story.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same high-rise as Smollett. “I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

ABC 7 Chicago’s Rob Elgas reported late Monday that shortly after the “Empire” star turned over the “limited and redacted” phone records connected to the alleged attack, Chicago police spokesman AJ Guglielmi told the outlet, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

“Detectives may be following up with him (Smollett) to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline,” Guglielmi added, Elgas reports.

On Monday, a spokesperson for Smollett told the New York Post in an email that phone records from Smollett’s manager, Brandon Z, “were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning.” The records from Smollett contained information “from within an hour of the incident,” the spokesperson added. Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel reported Monday that the records were “limited and redacted.”

Police requested Smollett’s phone records upon beginning the investigation into what Smollett described as a racist and homophobic attack that included the alleged assaulters tying a rope around his neck. Smollett said he was speaking with his manager when he was attacked while walking home from Subway at around 2 a.m. January 29. The men told police that the attackers said “This is MAGA country” and called Smollett a “f***ot” and “n***er,” while assaulting him and dousing him with an unknown chemical.

Smollett declined turning over his phone because he said he couldn’t be without it for a few hours, the Post reports. Guglielmi stressed to the Post Sunday afternoon that police “have no reason to doubt” Smollett, but need his phone data to further the investigation, particularly since none of the surveillance footage, which reportedly covers all but about 60 seconds of Smollett’s walk home from Subway, has shown any evidence of the attack.

An official with the department told CBS Chicago that video from Smollett’s building shows him “entering with what appears to be a noose around his neck.” Other surveillance footage shows two men dressed in dark clothes in the vicinity between 15 and 30 minutes before the actor arrived back at his apartment, but police have thus far been unable to identify the men and sources have suggested they might be homeless.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Guglielmi told the Post on Sunday. Last week, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson made headlines when said that while Smollett was still considered the “victim,” if the actor’s report turned out to be false, he would be held accountable.

On January 29, Smollett said he was confronted by two men, one masked, who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, threw an unknown chemical on him, believed to be bleach, and punched him in the face. They also allegedly tied a rope around his neck, the same rope he was still reportedly wearing when police arrived at his apartment about 45 minutes later.

Last week, police revealed that review of surveillance footage had thus far come up empty and that the rope had become a key component in the investigation. “Police say they’re trying to determine the origin of the rope that was used in the alleged attack,” CBS Chicago reported Thursday. “Detectives are looking into where it came from or where it may have been purchased.”

“We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “Detectives may be following up with him to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.”

Smollett alleges two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant on January 29. The 36-year-old alleges they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. Guglielmi said the actor told police that the alleged attackers shouted he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

The police report noted that the actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request — a reasonable request from crime victims, according to police.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses. Police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied, noose-like, around Smollet’s neck.

“We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,” Guglielmi said.

The downtown Chicago area wehre the alleged attack occured has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they have not found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

Guglielmi tweeted photos of the “persons of interest” one day after the alleged assault.

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story. “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” the actor said in a statement to ESSENCE magazine. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served. ”

Several days after the story broke, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the audience that if he did not perform his attackers would win. Addressing the nightclub with attendees that included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Hollywood producer Lee Daniels, Smollett vowed: “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let the motherfuckers win.”

“I have so many words on my heart. The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay,” he said. “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me.”

People have started to become skeptical about the incident involving Jussie Smollett where he was reportedly attacked by homophobic MAGA supporters.

RELATED: Chicago Police Intend To Charge Jussie Smollett If A False Report Was Filed

The New York Post reported on Monday that cops have yet to identify the suspects because Jussie is not cooperating with them. It was said that he refused to give up his phone because he couldn’t be without it. Many people instantly thought it was something sketchy about that.

The actors neighbors even started casting doubt on his story. But, before things could get worse, just hours later he finally decided to hand over his phone records to police.

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the “Empire” star said in an email.

“They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST].”

The police said they wanted the records so they could independently verify the two men’s accounts, which is needed for a criminal investigation, according to the Post. Despite, the delay, Smollett’s spokesperson told newspaper on Monday that the actor “is the victim here” and he has provided multiple statements to the police.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read.

Ellen Page has said we have ‘so far to go’ when it comes to LGBTQ rights, calling parts of society ‘queerphobic and transphobic’.

The Umbrella Academy actress has made headlines over the past few weeks due to her amazing takedown of Donald Trump and Mike Pence’s anti-LGBTQ administration and her calling out Chris Pratt for attending the ‘infamously anti-LGBTQ church’ Hillsong.

And while the 31-year-old acknowledged that we have made huge strides in rights for LGBTQ people, Ellen pointed out how far we still have to go.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Must Watch podcast, the Juno star said: ‘We have so far to go. There are so many states in America where you can just be fired for being who you are, denied housing for being who you are, trans women of colour in the United States of America have a life expectancy of 35, and really struggle.

‘Of course there’s been so much progress, wonderful progress. I’m married, for example. But a lot of the most marginalised people in the community get left behind, and a big part of that reason is there’s barely any LGBTQ representation. Has it got better? For sure. But it needs to go so much further, particularly in media, who are pretending it’s a debate whether or not trans people should have rights.

‘It’s a debate whether it’s ok or not to have a religious liberty law that would give you the right to deny an LGBTQ person service – that’s not a debate. Marriage equality wasn’t a debate.’

When asked why she thinks these things are framed as debates, Ellen replied: ‘People are really queerphobic and transphobic.’

The star blamed the Trump administration for the brutal attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett in an impassioned speech on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Ellen said: ‘If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering — what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street.

‘The vice president of America wishes I didn’t have the love of my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy, he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.’

Speaking about her speech, Ellen said: ‘I was just saying the truth, you know, and talking about the pain and trauma people suffer because of the rhetoric and policies of people in power and the damage I’ve seen that causes, and probably a little bit of my own pain too.’

Ellen publicly came out as gay during a speech at a Human Rights Campaign conference in 2014, and later alleged that filmmaker Brett Ratner outed her on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand when she was 18 years old.

But, according to the police, the records are insufficient.

The Chicago Tribune reports: ‘Investigators had sought Smollett’s phone records since shortly after he reported the attack Jan. 29 in the 300 block of East North Water Street. But police described Smollett’s phone records as a heavily redacted document file and his manager’s records as a screenshot of phone calls that provide limited information to investigators. Chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police were “appreciative” of Smollett’s cooperation in providing the records but said detectives will likely need additional data from Smollett to crack the case.’

The New York Post was first to report on Smollett’s release of phone records. They added: ‘Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has said that Smollett, 36, was being treated as a crime victim, but would be held accountable if cops learn he filed a false report. Smollett told cops he was confronted by two men, one wearing a black mask, who hurled gay and racist epithets at him, calling him “’Empire’ f—-t n—-r” while he was walking home shortly before 2 a.m. The assailants allegedly punched Smollett in the face, doused him with a liquid — believed to be bleach — and tied a rope around his neck in an underpass between the Sheraton and Loews Chicago hotels.’



The NYP said that last week it retraced Smollett’s route and discovered “an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach” and turned it over to police who turned it over to the FBI. They have declined to comment.

The FBI is also investigating a letter that was dropped off at the Empire studios, the Tribune adds: ‘On Jan. 22, witnesses told police a postal worker dropped off a letter at the studio where “Empire” is filmed. It was postmarked in southwest suburban Bedford Park on Jan. 18 and bore two American flag stamps. The letters MAGA were written in the upper-left corner of the envelope. Police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are related, and so far they are being investigated separately: the letter by the FBI and the alleged attack by Chicago police.’

Frank Gatson, the man who was with Smollett the night of the attack, spoke out last week in an interview with Extra.

Said Gatson: “I was there with Jussie. I’m the one who called 911, I am the one who took him to the hospital, and it was so scary, man, that was a scary night — my stomach was numb. I’m just glad I was the old man at his apartment when he got there, I was responsible. I said, ‘Let’s call the cops, let’s go to the hospital.’ Shout out to Chicago police, especially the sergeant that came and got things together and made us feel comfortable…Jussie is a very strong guy.”

Gatson also criticized some for their response to the attack: “It is amazing to me how the white community really supports the LGBTQ community, but it’s amazing how some black families would rather their son be a murderer than be gay. I hope that my community, the black community, understands it’s people’s business what their sexuality is. I just hope that one day the black community, the brown community, can wake up and support our brothers and sisters who are gay. The hateration is just unbelievable.”

CNN’s Don Lemon, a friend of Smollett’s told Jada Pinkett Smith on her show Red Table Talk, that he checks in with the Empire actor frequently: ‘Lemon said that he knew everyone would be picking Smollett’s story apart and that the details are not really his concern. Instead, he said, he was interested in Smollett’s “well-being.” He texts him daily to check in, because he believes he can relate very well to his situation, as a gay, black man in the spotlight. “Sometimes he responds, sometimes he doesn’t,” he said of Smollett, adding that he seems to appreciate the concern.’"

It is a way to symbolise, to highlight, and to stand in solidarity with these other identities.”

When the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office for LGBT Affairs in Philadelphia, Amber Hikes, and her team unveiled a new eight-stripe rainbow flag for Pride Month back in 2017 it was with the aim of giving a new symbol to the community that better recognised LGBTQ people of colour and their experiences.

Within 24 hours, however, a media storm had been whipped up around this more inclusive design, with certain parts of the community rejecting the flag and claiming that black activists had “hijacked” this symbol of Pride.

It quickly brought to the surface the often-ignored issue of racism within the LGBTQ community, which had long been lurking underneath not getting the appropriate conversation and action needed to tackle discrimination within our global queer family.

More recently in the UK, Manchester Pride announced plans to official adopt the eight-stripe flag as part of their celebrations this year, in solidarity with LGBTQ people of colour.

Once again, the negative social commentary around their decision within the community revealed a lack of understanding of what the More Colour, More Pride flag actually stands for, but also some blatant racism.

To give more context to the conversation that currently surrounds the More Colour, More Pride flag, Chloë Davies, a volunteer at UK Black Pride and queer woman of colour doing her bit to help change the world, speaks with Amber about the creation of the symbol, the backlash against it, and how this could be an opportunity for the community to come together in the fight for true equality for all.

Chloë: What inspired you two and half years ago to unveil the More Colour, More Pride flag?

Amber: We introduced the flag to the residents of Philadelphia and accidentally to the country, and then the rest of the world, in June of 2017. We actually worked with an ad agency to develop a symbol that really spoke to the experiences of LGBTQ people of colour, that are distinctly different to those of white LGBTQ people. There were a series of incidents over the last 30 years that contributed to the conversation here in Philadelphia. We saw a report from 1986 –given to the mayor at that time – that documented discriminatory practices in bars and organisations, things that are not unique to Philadelphia and that you see all over the country and all over the world. More specifically, we saw discriminatory dress code policies, black and brown people being required to show different forms of identification to get into a space where white folks could just come and go. We also saw a lack of representation in the leadership of our organisations. But what was really the smoking gun of this issue was an owner of a gay bar in Philadelphia caught on tape saying the n-word over and over again, and laughing about it. That was very painful for a lot of members of the community. It led to boycotts, protests, calls for leadership changes, along with a series of town halls addressing the experience of racism in the Philadelphia LGBTQ community. So when I came on as the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office for LGBT Affairs in Philadelphia, I was clear that I wanted to address those issues both symbolically and substantively. Substantively, we wanted to push legislation, host community conversations, and change policy. But symbolically we needed something that could document this time in our country’s history, this time in our city’s history, the conversations we are having, and really to make a promise to LGBTQ people of colour, specifically, to say that these concerns are not going to be ignored anymore. They’re not going to be dismissed. We’re going to acknowledge them, and do so head-on. That’s how the flag came to be.

Amber Hikes and Chloë Davies

Chloë: So you introduce the flag and what happens?

Amber: We raised it in Pride Month on a Thursday. There were unicorns, glitter, and the usual queer excitement. In Philadelphia, people understood the context. They knew the conversation we’d been having over three decades. They knew the recent events and the unrest that existed in the city at the time. Unbeknownst to us, this flag went viral within 24 hours. We raised it on a Thursday and CNN reported on it first thing Friday morning. It was viral immediately. So what happened was this conversation started taking place around the country and world without the local context. So when LA and San Francisco receive it, or London and Sydney got it, the narrative changed. They received this news as ‘These activists are changing the flag.’ It was presented without context, and most of the people telling this story had not experienced racism within the LGBTQ community. So once again we saw the voices of LGBTQ people of colour being shouted over, shouted down, and white-washed. The vast majority of folks were excited about the unveiling and the response was overwhelmingly positive, but of course that wasn’t the entirety of the response.

Chloë: So I’m going to come back to context because that is really relevant to where we are here in the UK. How did you change the context after it went viral? At least in terms for the US and Australia where they’ve suddenly seen this symbol that actually has underpinned for a lot of – unfortunately – sensitive white folk how they view their flag. How did you then change that context because we’re now two and half years later and it’s around the world.

Amber: Well the brilliant thing about how quickly the flag spread was that it forced a conversation that was clearly not happening in other places in the way that it was here in Philadelphia. Seeing that flag and that image, and then seeing the visceral response certain members of our community had, proved the point. People know that I received hate mail and death threats for these stripes on the flag. And as horrible and painful as that experience was personally, it proved the point over and over again. These individuals are shouting over us saying that racism doesn’t exist, saying that we are making up. But while you’re shouting over us, you’re calling me the n-word. You’re saying that black activists are hijacking the community, and that there is no place for us here. You’re proving the point over and over again. It actually helped us to begin having conversations that were long overdue about how experiences can be so different for members who are supposed to be from the same communities. It really prompted a much-needed conversation.

Chloë: You are now travelling around the world and you get the update from your office from someone who tells you, ‘Manchester Pride in the UK is adopting the flag. They’ve openly said we stand in solidarity of LGBTQ people of colour and for this reason we are adopting this flag.’ What was that like? Because this was the first city in the UK that turned around and said, ‘We get it. We understand it and we want to be a part of this conversation.’

Amber: I had two distinct responses. I was overwhelmed with joy. I was so excited and so happy for you all – specifically LGBTQ people of colour, but also white folks who want to do better, white folks who think they are great allies but really don’t know what is required to show up as true allies. So I was overwhelmed with joy for that decision. But I was also absolutely concerned about the response. It’s because I knew how much of a challenge it was – not just for me, but for LGBTQ people of colour as a whole – to see what bit of backlash can come from white people who are supposed to be our siblings in this fight. White folks who, when we were fighting for equal marriage or the end of the epidemic, we were on the front lines together. But I know how heartbreaking it is to see white LGBTQ folks say, ‘No, no, no, this isn’t about you. This space is not for you. You adding these stripes on this flag somehow takes away from our experience and we will not allow it.’ How heartbreaking it was as black and brown LGBTQ people to see that response and say, ‘Oh, we really are not there yet. This community is not ours. Even here we are second-class citizens.’ So I was worried about that, and I hoped that was not going to happen. Maybe Manchester was not going to have that experience. So I was simultaneously overjoyed and really concerned that that would be the reality.

Chloë: This is a monumental thing. It’s not just you – I recognise that this is a team effort in your office – but you’ve all done the work. Does it bother you when it’s reproduced? How do we authentically do that work with you?

Amber: Oh no! Not at all. In fact, when we put the flag out there, we put it out into the public domain. There’s no trademark on it, nobody has any rights to it, it is for public use, consumption, however folks want to use it. That was a very intentional decision. That’s exactly how Gilbert Baker did it with his original six-stripe rainbow flag, and all the iterations of that. We wanted to fall in line with that as well. There is a chance this flag will move on and not be connected to my team in the way the six-stripe flag will be connected with Gilbert Baker’s name, and that’s fine with me. I just want to make sure that people everywhere can see it, and finally see their experience reflected. We deserve that as a community. We have so many flags that represent so many different identities, so that’s why it was important for me to have that out there and for people of colour to be able to look at it and say, ‘Here we are too.’ The same way that we can say the rainbow flag is for the whole LGBTQ community, but we also know that bi folks have a separate flag, lesbians have a separate flag, trans folks have a separate flag, and intersex folks have a separate one, and that’s okay. The rainbow flag can be the catch-all, but we then have separate flags to represent different identities. That’s the beauty of the More Colour More Pride flag.

Chloë: For myself as I identify as an LGBTQ woman of colour, I always look to history. History is important to me. I come from an African-American background, and our history and where we come from is inspired in everything we do. Your family, your elders (Grandparents, Aunties and Uncles) from one generation to the next they pass down our stories. I never felt like, whilst I was part of a ‘rainbow family’, that it was completely whole until I saw this flag. And then suddenly I felt, ‘Hey, these are my colours, and then there are my colours, and it’s all together as one.’ That’s powerful. So how do we get that transition here because I guess what we’re struggling with in the UK is very much similar to Philadelphia. People of colour are saying – especially in the LGBTQ community – ‘We don’t see ourselves, we haven’t felt loved, we don’t feel visible, and we don’t feel safe, and in this way with this flag we are seen.’ And again, like you’ve seen in a lot of communities, a large majority of the white community are saying, ‘Hold on, we don’t even want to hear this part of your conversation.’ So how can we make the balance? What words can you give to us here in London to actually get the community behind us?

Amber: That’s so heartbreaking, but unfortunately it’s not surprising. What I will say is, that this was part of the conversation we had to have here in the city. Once folks understood the flag, they were grappling with, ‘How do I continue to be an ally? How do I continue to stand in solidarity?’ So what I would say to white folks specifically who feel like this flag isn’t necessary, and that the rainbow flag included all these voices beforehand is that 1) the six-stripe flag still exists in the same way it always has. When trans folks got a flag, the existence of that new flag didn’t take anything away from the six-stripe design. You can still raise that flag if it feels more comfortable for you. This eight-stripe flag is not a replacement, in the same way that that those other flags didn’t replace the original. Instead it is a way to symbolise, to highlight, and to stand in solidarity with these other identities. That is literally the purpose of any flag we have – to stand as a symbol for an identity, whether it’s a country, a municipality, a company, it stands as a symbol to recognise and highlight the experiences of this entity. The existence of this flag doesn’t take away from anybody else’s identity. It only adds to great inclusion. The other thing I’d say to folks who are really pushing back against it is, this is a perfect opportunity to stop and think about why. Why does this upset you? Did you have this same reaction with other flags? Because let’s make this clear, at any Pride parade there are many different versions of the rainbow flag. I’ve seen ones with a Mexican flag as part of it, the Star of David, ones with marijuana leaves, there’s all kinds of different rainbow flags to represent different communities and identities. If that did not offend you, but this one does, then why? You’ve heard me talking about interrogating your privilege and interrogating your surroundings, but I need folks to interrogate their responses. If your response to something that stands in solidarity with black and brown folks is to be viscerally angry, and that’s not your response to other symbols, I need you to think about why that is and what that says about you. That’s how we saw the conversation start changing. We also saw there were folks who live in their range who were like, ‘I can’t quite understand why, but I just don’t like it. I don’t think it’s pretty.’ Whatever that was.

Chloë: Or, ‘It makes me feel uncomfortable…’

Amber: Right! Then there were other folks who were absolutely livid about it, and frankly were just blatantly racist. What we saw with those people who were just a little bit uncomfortable, when they saw that the people who agreed with their discomfort were just blatantly racist, they were like, ‘Oh wait, no no no – I don’t want to be associated with that. I need to recognise what my discomfort is rooted in, and let me start to interrogate why I feel that way and figure it out.’ So that’s just a little bit of what I would give folks to consider for themselves. And I have to say, even if you don’t feel this is necessary and you don’t think there was any point to it, I need you to talk to LGBTQ people of colour, period. Have you asked them what their experiences are? And only then, when you shut up and listen, will you be able to move forward. This idea of white folks shouting over people and telling LGBTQ people of colour that their experiences aren’t real or valid, it does not feel dissimilar to when straight folks shout over queer people about the ‘gay agenda’.

Chloë: I just want to touch upon Jussie Smollett’s attack. We come from that place and we recognise it, but also the pushback from people that… this is an everyday reality if you’re an LGBTQ person of colour. Like actually to live and walk in the street. We’re not just talking about the Jussies, we’re also talking about our trans women of colour who are dying and nobody is caring. The majority isn’t hearing or recognising or remembering them. Where is the line where actually enough is going to be enough? The pushback is, ‘Well, what did he do that actually caused this to happen?’ Even when it happens, the narrative of ‘Well, there must be missing pieces of information.’ A gay black man can’t just walk the street and not have something happen to him that he hasn’t brought upon himself?

Amber: That kind of victim-blaming is just so painful to hear about – especially as a person who holds all of these identities. I identify as a black person, a queer person, a woman, so that kind of victim-blaming for a person who has all of these intersecting identities, it’s so painful. What I can say is, if your response to hearing about an experience of a hate crime, is ‘Well, what was he doing?’, that’s rooted in privilege. You don’t have access to the real lived experience of people in marginalised groups. Again, I’d say that if that’s your true position, it is rooted in privilege and good on you for not having to be terrified, to have the real experience of having your fellow citizens be out to harm you. That’s just not a reality for those of us from marginalised communities. I would push folks again to just have conversations with people of different identities.

﻿

Chloë: You’ve lined up my final question perfectly because I want to end with your amazing rallying call at Out & Equal when you said, ‘It is time to recognise our privilege.’ How do we tell the people in the UK how to weaponise their privilege for each other? What I think is inspiring, and I think people actually don’t really remember, when we’re in these positions that you and I are in, whilst we might be the many different layers of woman, unapologetically black, queer, or in my case a parent, we speak up on behalf of our entire community. We don’t just speak up for people of colour. We speak for our trans, non-binary, white, lesbian, accessible siblings, we speak for LGBTQIA+. How do we weaponise that privilege for all of us? Because if we don’t do it together, we’re never going to get anywhere.

Amber: When we’re talking about weaponising one’s privilege, the only issue with throwing that out to folks is there’s a whole process that comes before weaponising your privilege: you have to first recognise your privilege. That’s my concern with some of these folks who are having this push back. You have not yet recognised the privilege you have as a white LGBTQ person if you are pushing back against something as simple as two stripes on a flag. You don’t understand.

Chloë: You don’t want to get it.

Amber: You don’t want to get it! You certainly can’t weaponise privilege if you don’t even recognise that you have it. So that’s the first step. We all have privilege, right? Even as a black queer woman I have privilege.

Chloë: Me too.

Amber: So you need to find out what you can do with that privilege in service to folks who are marginalised in this conversation specifically. If we were talking about white folks people who also hold an LGBTQ identity, this is a perfect time to have a real conversation on first recognising the importance of the flag and what it means to other folks, but then use that opportunity to have a real conversation with other white people. Explain to them that they need to recognise their privilege and start listening to different experiences and different identities. To recognise your privilege and then weaponise it, you are calling in people who hold similar identities. Then at that point we can start to show up, speak up, and stand up for one another. We’re talking to people, we’re listening to them, we recognise what their needs are and we find ways to show up and to stand up. This labour is difficult – it’s exhausting. And particularly exhausting when you’re a member of multiple marginalised groups. We need allies, we need accomplices in this work because, as you mentioned, if we don’t do it together, it’s not going to get done. We’re all we’ve got.

Chloë: Thank you. I can’t say anything more than thank you. Everything I could have hoped for this conversation that my community can hear… when we find authentic people that amplify thousands upon thousands of voices using their platform and their privilege, we need to share that message. We need to talk about it, and we need to bring each other together. How do you think we got equal marriage in the first place? Everybody came together. So why, when we are having these types of conversation, is it any different? I said this at a panel event last year when someone said, ‘We have equal marriage now, so the battle is won – what’s next?’ I turned around and I said, ‘Y’know what? I don’t know what that’s like, it doesn’t exist for me. But what I do know is, when I go out and do what I do, I volunteer my time for our community, time I take away from my two young children and I never stop fighting for you. So the fact you’ve already given up on me is incredibly disappointing.’ We can’t keep doing that to each other. Because who else have we got apart from each other? We have a lot of work to do but I believe we’re going to get there in the end though!

Amber: We are! We absolutely are.

The actor, who recently announced the end of his eight year marriage to Anna Faris, said in an acceptance speech at the Teen Choice Awards that he lied to his first agent and jokingly added it 'was the first of many lies I told to get where I am today'.

The speech, which was an attempt at self-deprecation, came when he was awarded twice for Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.

Just kidding! Chris Pratt said he built his Hollywood career on lies at the Teen Choice Awards on Sunday night

The 38-year-old appeared in good spirits, despite the fresh split, as he recalled how his career began.

'When I came to Los Angeles,' Pratt said, 'I came from Hawaii and I had all of this blond hair and I was tan and I met an agent because I really wanted to be an actor and get an agent.'

He then said that the agent asked, '""Wow. Bro you must surf?"" And I said ""Yeah"" and that was the first of many lies I told to get where I am today. Thank you.'

The actor also confirmed he would be coming back for a third Guardians film.

He also made sure to give a shout out to Guardians of the Galaxy writer/director James Gunn, whom the actor said was coming back for a third.

Meanwhile, Chris , 38, and Anna, 40, shocked the world when they announced their separation on Monday.

And sources are now claiming that Chris' movie star status and skyrocketing fame might have contributed to the demise of the couple's eight-year marriage.

Competitive? Sources claim Pratt and Faris' shocking split might have been caused by Chris' movie star status and skyrocketing fame

'Chris became this huge movie star and Anna wasn't getting any big jobs. She was the more famous and sexy one at the start of their relationship and then things took a turn,' a source told Us Weekly.

When the couple first started dating in 2009, Chris was just starting his stint on NBC's Parks and Recreation and had virtually no star power.

Anna, on the other hand, was starting to bonafide comedic actress with leading roles in House Bunny, Take Me Home Tonight and What's Your Number.

Friends say the situation has since reversed itself and Chris has gone on to become a major A-list star, while Anna has had a hard time finding big jobs.

The source added that the pair have always been a little competitive with each other.

'When they're in a big group, they each want to be the one telling the funniest joke,' the source told the magazine.

Ironically, Anna blamed her last divorce on the same issue.

The actress was married to actor Ben Indra, but got divorced in 2007 and blamed her career successes.

Happier times: The couple pictured in 2012 when Anna was still the bigger movie star

'That kind of destroyed my marriage,' she told Marie Claire in a 2011 cover story. 'The divide became too great.'

Anna and Chris announced their separation on Sunday evening following eight years of marriage, with other sources telling TMZ that their different family values were to blame.

A source told the site that Anna wanted to have more children, but Chris 'can't juggle a growing family with his career', which sees him shoot movies all over the world, leaving home for months at a time.

The couple share four-year-old son Jack, and were keen to stress in their split statement that they 'love him very much'.

The website reports that as well as Chris not wanting to have more children in the foreseeable future there are 'other personal reasons for the split, but the way they see family in the long-term was a big factor in their decision.'

MailOnline have contacted Chris and Anna's representatives for comment.

Co-stars: Jennifer and Chris starred together in the 2016 sci-fi flick Passengers

Following the shock announcement Jennifer Lawrence also found herself in the middle of reports.

As the couple confirmed their separation, fans flocked to social media to bizarrely blame the actress, 26 - who starred in Passengers with Chris in 2016 - for the split.

Taking to Twitter, one wrote: 'I can't believe Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are splitting up this is all Jennifer Lawrence's fault.'"

According to reports, residents who live in Jussie’s building are having a hard time wrapping their heads around some of the details of his version of events, according to the New York Post.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same high-rise as the “Empire” star.

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”

“It’s a lie, because Chicago is the most liberal city around,” said a patron at Lizzie McNeill’s Irish Pub, about a block from the scene of the alleged Jan. 29 incident, who wouldn’t give his name. “They have cameras everywhere … Why can’t they find the attack?”

As we previously reported, Smollett was allegedly attacked last month in Chicago by two masked assailants who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor.

The suspects reportedly doused him with bleach and tied a noose around his neck during the racially-charged attack. Jussie reportedly transported himself to a local hospital and was released hours later in “good condition.”

The suspects allegedly recognized Smollett from his role as gay singer/songwriter Jamal Lyon on “Empire” and shouted, “Aren’t you that f**got Empire n**ger?”

His manager, Brandon Z. Moore, said he was on the phone with Jussie at the time of the attack, and confirmed that the suspects were using racial slurs.

Chicago police said Sunday that Smollett has yet to turn over data from his cellphone to verify that he was on the phone with Moore, who has said that he also heard the assailants shout the words “MAGA country.”

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

“We offered to take the phone to download the data and he expressed he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”

Jussie Smollett will reportedly speak about the incident in an interview for “Good Morning America” on Tuesday with Robin Roberts."

We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m., according to the police report.

Police said Smollett gave them a PDF file of redacted phone calls but did not provide “a download of the phone or a digital record.” They said there is no reason to suggest that the records were modified. Police plan to use the record to corroborate the timeline of the alleged attack.

It was not immediately clear why the call log was redacted.

“Police continue to treat Smollett as a victim, and are investigating this as a possible hate crime,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. “Police remain interested in identifying and contacting people of interest. Investigators may want to speak to Smollett again. They are not even looking at charges regarding filing a false report.”

Police said earlier in the investigation that Smollett was hesitant to report the crime but his manager convinced him to. Both Smollett and his manager told police they could not be away from their phones for prolonged periods of time, so they refused to give the devices over to police, Guglielmi.

The police spokesman reiterated that detectives are not looking at Smollett as anything but the victim in this case.

“It's very premature,” Guglielmi said. “We are not there yet.”

Smollett recently thanked fans for their support and addressed ""inaccuracies and misrepresentations"" about what he called a ""cowardly"" attack on him in downtown Chicago in a statement to NBC News.



“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett wrote. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.""



Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the hit Fox television show, said he was ""working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

According to the police report, Smollett said his attackers identified him with racist and homophobic names and also referred to his affiliation with the show ""Empire.""

Both attackers were dressed in all black and one was wearing a black mask, the police report stated.

Smollett's family issued a statement through a spokesman last week saying they believe he was the victim of an unprovoked ""racial and homophobic hate crime"" and that he has been forthright with the police, who are still searching for surveillance video of the attack.

Smollett's manager called police about 40 minutes after he got home, Guglielmi said. When officers arrived, the actor had cuts and scrapes on his face and the rope around his neck. Smollett later went to a hospital for treatment.

Smollett's family thanked the public ""for their prayers"" and said they are ""so grateful that God saw him through this cowardly attack alive.""

""We want people to understand these targeted hate crimes are happening to our sisters, brothers and our gender non-conforming siblings, many who reside within the intersection of multiple identities, on a monthly, weekly, and sometimes even daily basis all across our country,"" the family said. ""Oftentimes ending fatally, these are inhumane acts of domestic terrorism and they should be treated as such.""

They said such incidents will continue to happen until people are held accountable.

Detectives have recovered surveillance footage of Smollett walking home from a Subway restaurant that morning, including video of him arriving at his apartment building with a rope around his neck, Guglielmi said.

Detectives, who are investigating the case as a possible hate crime, have watched hundreds of hours of footage from private and public surveillance cameras, but gaps remain and they still haven't seen video of the attack or men who match Smollett's description of his assailants, Guglielmi said.

The area is home to many high-end hotels and restaurants and has hundreds of cameras, so there are still many more videos for investigators to collect and go through as they try to get a complete picture of Smollett's walk home, Guglielmi said. It is tedious work that is made more difficult because the timestamps on various cameras may not be in sync, meaning detectives have to figure out the exact times of events, he said.

""It's like putting together a puzzle,"" he said.

Guglielmi said Smollett and his manager told detectives they were talking on the phone at the time of the attack, but that the 36-year-old actor declined to turn over his phone records to the detectives, who routinely ask for such information during criminal investigations.

Police are hoping to identify and talk to two people who were walking in the area at the time of the attack and whose grainy image the department released. Guglielmi stressed that the people are not considered suspects and that police want to question them because they were in the vicinity and might have useful information.

Reports of the attack drew a flood of outrage and support for Smollett on social media. Some of the outrage stemmed from Smollett's account to detectives that his attackers yelled that he was in ""MAGA country,"" an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.

President Donald Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett on Thursday.

""That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn't get worse,"" the president told reporters when asked about the matter. The spot where Smollett says he was attacked isn't far from the Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The FBI is investigating a threatening letter targeting Smollett that was sent last week to the Fox studio in Chicago where ""Empire"" is filmed, Guglielmi said. The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.

In addition to his acting career, Smollett has a music career and is a noted activist, particularly on LBGTQ issues. Smollett's representative said his concert scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles will go on as planned.

Now in its fifth season, the hour-long drama ""Empire"" follows an African-American family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry. Smollett's character is the middle son of Empire Entertainment founder Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon, played by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, respectively.

Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses and in train tunnels."

“Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt,” a spokesperson for the Empire star said in an email reports Page Six.

Cops requested Smollett’s phone records to confirm statements that he was on a call with his manager Brandon Z. Moore during the attack. Both allege the Empire star was called a “f—-t” and a “n—-r” and Moore insists he heard the assailants yell “MAGA country.”

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Post on Sunday.

As theGrio previously reported, Smollett claims he was assaulted by two masked men in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, as he was walking home from a nearby Subway sandwich shop. The assailants reportedly doused him with bleach and tied a rope around his neck.

—REPORT: ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett hospitalized after MAGA supporters beat him and put a noose around his neck “Aren’t you that f***ot ‘Empire’ n*gger’—

Smollett’s spokesperson told The Post that he “is the victim here” and “Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” the statement read.

“Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

Meanwhile, New York Post reports that residents who live in Jussie’s building are giving the side-eye to his official version of events.

“I don’t believe it happened the way he said it did,” said Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same swank high-rise near the Navy Pier as Smollett.

—Kamala Harris says she’s ‘absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana’—

“I’ve been in this neighborhood five years. I don’t believe it, not around here … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.”



The investigation continues.



Smollett, meanwhile, will reportedly appear on Good Morning America on Tuesday and he is expected clear up any confusion about what’s being reported."

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed that Smollett handed over portions of his call log from the early hours of Jan. 29. That call log will be analyzed and detectives may be in contact with Smollett again should they have more questions.

Smollett has told police that he was walking in the 300 block of East North Water Street about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him, yelled the slurs, hit him in the face, poured a substance — suspected to be bleach — on him and put a “thin, light rope” around his neck.

Smollett initially was “reluctant” to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, Guglielmi previously said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

The actor said he was on the phone with his manager at the time of the attack. His manager has said that he could hear the attack over the phone and was able to hear the phrase “MAGA country” — the acronym from President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

With the exception of a handful of precincts on the Northwest and Southwest sides, Chicago overwhelming supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. During the campaign, a Trump rally at UIC was cancelled after widespread protests, with fights breaking out afterwards.

Internet sleuths have cast aspersions on Smollett’s story since it was first reported, and an incomplete phone log may do little, if anything, to quell those doubts.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” Smollett said in a previously released statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said earlier this month that Smollett has been cooperative with detectives, and that the department is making progress in its investigation.

“We have no reason to think he’s not being genuine with us,” Johnson said. “The allegations that are described to us are horrendous, horrible and quite frankly cowardly. He is a victim, and we treat him like a victim.”

The New York Post has dispatched several reporters to Chicago to retrace Smollett’s steps in the minutes before the alleged attack. Last week, one of them discovered a hot sauce bottle that smelled like bleach near where Smollett said he was attacked.

The bottle was turned over to Chicago Police for analysis. Investigators have already conducted several canvasses of the area and Guglielmi on Monday said it was not clear if the bottle was “connected or not connected” to the alleged attack."

""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett has turned over partial records of his cellphone use to detectives investigating an alleged assault by two men hurling racial and homophobic slurs, Chicago police said Monday.

Smollett, who is African-American and openly gay, has told police that he was beaten up by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs early on Jan. 29. Police say they are investigating the report as a possible hate crime.

The actor told police that he was on the phone with his manager as the alleged attack occurred.

His manager told police that he heard the attackers say ""this is MAGA country,"" police officials said. ""MAGA"" is a common shorthand for ""Make America Great Again,"" President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

A few days after the reported attack, police said they asked Smollett to hand over his cellphone to aid in their investigation, but that he refused.

On Monday, 13 days after the alleged assault, Smollett gave investigators a PDF file containing a redacted list of his calls, Anthony Guglielmi, a police spokesman, told NBC News.

“They have Jussie’s records from within an hour of the incident. The police confirmed receipt of the records at [2:28 p.m. EST],” the spokesperson added.

According to Fox 32 Chicago’s Rafer Weigel, the records were “limited and redacted.”

The Chicago Police Department “received cell phone records today from Smollett’s camp. They were limited and redacted but detectives will analyze them and be in touch with [Jussie Smollett] if they have any other questions,” Weigel wrote in a tweet on Monday evening.

The police department asked Smollett and his manger Brandon Z. Moore to hand over their phone records to corroborate the very serious alleged attack. The actor said he was on the phone with Moore at the time of the ambush.

Smollett delayed handing over his phone records when police requested them, telling officers “he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours,” reported the Post.

“We have no reason to doubt the statements, but for a criminal investigation, we need to independently confirm the phone records,” said Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

Both Smollett and Moore claim the alleged attackers screamed about Smollett being in “MAGA country” — a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan “Make American Great Again” — and called the actor a “n*****” and “f*****.”

Smollett was allegedly attacked by two men around 2:30 a.m. when he was walking home from a Subway shop on January 29. Along with allegedly throwing racial and homophobic slurs at Smollett, the men — one in a black mask — allegedly tied a rope around the actor’s neck and doused him in a liquid, which was possibly bleach.

“Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie’s account of what happened that night consistent and credible,” a statement from the star’s rep said. “Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. We are continuing to work closely with the Chicago PD and remain confident that they will find Jussie’s attackers and bring them to justice.”

As noted by The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti, Chicago police have confirmed that Smollett walked “several blocks to and from a Subway sandwich shop that evening.” However, the actor “was on camera for all but about 60 seconds of his trip, during which Smollett reports the attack took place.”

“Although two individuals were pictured on security cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked, sources close to CPD told local media that those two individuals appear to be homeless and were in the vicinity between 15 and 30 minutes before Smollett arrived back at his apartment on East Water Street, just north of the Chicago River,” noted Zanotti. “Chicago Police also reportedly dismissed a neighbor’s claim that a ‘redneck’-looking man was loitering behind Smollett’s apartment building, according to Chicago crime watch blog, CWB Chicago.”

On Tuesday, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett was still being treated as a “victim,” but noted that the actor would be held accountable if the report were to turn out to be false, reported Weigel.

“Chicago Police received limited and redacted phone records from the victim,” the Chicago PD said in a statement Monday. “These records will be analyzed by detectives and we will be in contact with the victim should additional information be needed.”

“Usually when we ask people to hand over their records, they just hand over their phone,” Chicago PD spokesman Howard Ludwig said.

Later on Monday, another Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, told Chicago’s ABC 7, “We are very appreciative of the victim’s cooperation however the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.”

Reps for Smollett did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.

Smollett told Chicago police on Jan. 29 that two men attacked him while yelling racial and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” A police statement said chemicals were poured on the “Empire” star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.

Police had asked for Smollett’s phone records because he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z. Moore, during the attack.

On Jan. 31, the Chicago PD told TheWrap in a statement: “Both the victim and the manager made independent statements to detectives that they were on the phone with one another during the alleged attack. CPD has no reason to doubt these claims. Detectives, however, were not able to independently verify the statements as cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked. Therefore we are not able to confirm this.”

On Feb. 1, an individual close to the situation told TheWrap that police never specifically asked Smollett to hand over his phone records. Rather, the person said, police “casually asked if he wanted to turn over his phone,” but Smollett was not comfortable giving it up.

Also on Monday, CPD said that an empty bottle that smelled like bleach was found near the location where Smollett said he was attacked. The bottle was found by New York Post reporters who had retraced the actor’s path the night of the incident.

“It’s unclear if that is related to the incident as it was not discovered during any of the earlier canvasses but we took it for analysis,” a spokesperson for Chicago PD said in a statement. “The FBI is providing CPD with technical assistance on this case at our request. I’m not sure if the bottle went to their lab or one of ours.”"

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who said he was the victim of a racial and homophobic attack Jan. 29 in Chicago, provided his phone records to the Chicago Police Department Monday morning, The New York Post reports.

The move came after The Post reported separately that some of Smollett’s neighbors were expressing doubt about the accuracy of Smollett’s account of the alleged attack. During the investigation, authorities have brought up Smollett’s failure to turn over data from his cellphone that might verify that he was on the phone with his music manager Brandon Moore at the time of the attack.

The Post reports that a spokesperson for Smollett said in an email today: “Phone records from Jussie’s manager were sent to police on Feb. 5 and Jussie’s records were sent over this morning. Both were sent to Chief of Staff to the Superintendent of Police Robert Boik, who confirmed receipt.”

The report notes that authorities requested the phone records to corroborate a claim by Smollett that he was on the phone with Moore during the attack.

“Both men allege Smollett was called a ‘f—-t’ and a ‘n—-r’ during the attack and both said they heard the words ‘MAGA country,’ an apparent reference to President Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan,” The Post reports. “The police said they wanted the records so they could independently verify the two men’s accounts, which is needed for a criminal investigation, but Smollett told police he couldn’t be without his phone for several hours.”
