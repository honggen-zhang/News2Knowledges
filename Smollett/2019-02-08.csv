AD

Is that good or bad?

*Laughs* It’s good. I get to see everybody at once.

Your “Empire” co-star Jussie Smollett was allegedly attacked in what police are investigating as a potential hate crime. Do you think the incident is being handled appropriately?

AD

Right now, they’re investigating. So you just have to wait and see what they come up with. But all I know is that Jussie is resilient, and he’s full of love, and this is not going to break him. He just has to stay focused and not let this make him bitter because that’s what the negative forces want.

You’re here in Washington to promote “What Men Want,” which is a very high-energy movie. How do you stay “on” all the time?

AD

I have a switch, literally. And I amaze myself. But I guess it’s just years and years of my body being conditioned to turning on and off. I’ll go into a scene saying, “I’m not even going to do it because I don’t feel like it,” and as soon as they yell, “Action!” I can’t even control it anymore.

Just like if you played an actual instrument, you can’t say, “I don’t feel good today.” You can still make that piano hit F sharp because you’re conditioned to doing it. That’s how I look at my body, and that’s why I’m able to transform and do physical comedy. Because [“What Men Want”] is physical comedy. You can get more laughs just by not saying anything. I learned from the best.

AD

Was anything in “What Men Want” improvised? What about Tracy Morgan’s long-winded smoothie line?

AD

They just let the camera roll on him. I think some takes, because it was his close-up, I was just sitting over there on the other side like this *folds arms behind her head and kicks her feet up on the coffee table*. We were like, “What else is he going to come up with?” Every take he added some more [to the smoothie line].

And Erykah Badu. That whole her-coming-down-the-steps was all her. That’s the important thing in casting, especially a comedy. It is imperative that every actor is comedy. You can’t have one weak link in a comedy because it has to move, and one person could drag it. I think that’s why this movie works, because everybody brought their A-game.

This is a more comedy-centered role than you’ve had in recent years. Comedy is what you were planning on pursuing originally, right?

AD

AD

That’s what I tried doing.

Do you think you’ll have more comedic roles from now on?

I hope so, but the next script that I have is so depressing. It’s a very important story. I don’t mean to make light of it, but I mean, really? *Laughs* I really want to laugh because [my “Empire” character] Cookie is so emotionally draining for me eight months out of the year. That’s what was so refreshing about [“What Men Want”] — I got to laugh all summer.

This movie was a spinoff of the 2000 flick “What Women Want,” starring Mel Gibson. Did you feel pressured that people would compare this film to the original?

No, because it’s coming from a whole different perspective and a different time in history. The only thing that’s in common is that we get a gift to hear the opposite sex’s thoughts. And then it’s a black woman [in “What Men Want”]. So I didn’t really need to watch it, but I knew it could work. I’ve done [a remake] before with “Karate Kid.” We weren’t trying to reinvent the wheel. We were trying to take that concept and make it our own, and bring it up to date.

AD

AD

The movie has a somewhat political tone, with references to the #MeToo movement. Was that intentional?

There’s no way we could do a film like this in this climate and not deal with it. But how do we deal with it in a way that doesn’t feel preachy? You do it through laughter. That’s what I think makes a good comedy work — when it has heart. When it’s rooted in something real. That’s why “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” worked. That’s why “Pretty Woman” worked. That’s what makes a successful comedy. It can’t just be for jokes, they don’t work.

Except if it’s “Airplane.” That movie is just hilarious.

Do you consider yourself political?

I’m too honest. I don’t like all the B.S. that goes into it. I have enough games in Hollywood I’ve got to play. I’m not the political girl. I’m too emotional.

AD

You posted on your Instagram about Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) announcing their presidential bids. Are you actively supporting either one?

AD

That was just for Black History Month. If it weren’t for the civil rights movement, Cory couldn’t dream. Neither could Kamala. It doesn’t mean anything about who I’m voting for. It’s too early in the game to choose. I posted her on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday because if it were not for a him, a black woman could not even put in her [presidential] bid.

You caught a bit of flak a couple of weeks ago when people thought you were defending R. Kelly on Instagram.

I never made a comment. I made an observation. And then people projected, as humans do, but that’s not me. That’s them.

AD

Okay, if you could pick any superpower what it be? I’m assuming not mind-reading."

According to TMZ, after being brutally attacked on January 29, actor Jussie Smollett is back at work in Chicago on the set of Empire. A production source says Smollett returned to the Windy City on February 3, following performing before a sold-out crowd at the Troubadoor nightclub in West Hollywood, California on February 2. Sources say Smollett filmed scenes for Empire on February 4, and participated in a table read with cast members on February 5. The Chicago Police Department have found video of Smollett before and after the alleged attack, but nothing of the actual incident……..

Criminal Minds star Shemar Moore, who got his acting start on The Young and Restless, spoke to People Magazine, regarding the impact his former co-star Kristoff St. John, had upon his life both personally and professionally. St. John was found dead in his San Fernando Valley, California home by a friend on February 3. “I’m raised as an only child, but Kristoff is truly the closest thing to a brother and a brother’s love and a brother’s mentorship that I’ve ever known,” Moore revealed about their relationship. He went on to say that St. John didn’t have to embrace him the way that he did, because if that had not happened, Moore says he would never gotten his sure footing in the beginning days. St. John’s autopsy has been completed, but the cause of death is deferred. His son Julian St. John committed suicide in 2014. Kristoff threatened suicide in 2017, and was treated for depression just two weeks ago. My sincere condolences go out to his former wife boxing champion Mia St. John and their daughter Paris St. John………..

ASSOCIATED PRESS

CHICAGO — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett said Friday that he has been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation into what he says was a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago earlier this week.

In his first public comments since he says two masked men attacked him early Tuesday in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime, the Black and openly gay actor disputed assertions leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level,” he said in a statement released by an intermediary a day after his family put out a similar statement. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Smollett, 36, told police that two masked men attacked him along a street in the Streeterville neighborhood as he was walking home from a restaurant. He said they punched him, hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck.

That area of downtown Chicago has many hotels and restaurants and has widespread surveillance video coverage, and although police have found footage of Smollett making his way home — including video of him arriving at his building with a rope around his neck — they haven’t found footage of the attack or men fitting his description of his assailants.

In his statement, Smollett expressed gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” he has received since the attack — even the president weighed in Thursday, calling it “horrible.” But critics have also taken to social media to suggest that Smollett changed his account of what happened and hasn’t cooperated fully with investigators, pointing to what police say was Smollett’s refusal to let detectives go through his phone records to verify that he on a call with his manager when he was attacked.

On Friday, Johnson, said during an appearance on WLS-TV that even though detectives haven’t found video of the attack, Smollett has been “very cooperative and we have no reason at this point to think he’s not being genuine with us.”

Even though detectives are still collecting and sifting through footage from the many public and private surveillance cameras near the site where Smollett said he was attacked, Johnson said it wouldn’t be unusual that such an attack wouldn’t be caught on video.

Although Chicago has extensive network of cameras, it doesn’t provide full coverage, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi explained. Some cameras rotate and don’t continuously capture footage of the same spots, so there is a good chance that detectives may not find footage of Smollett being attacked, he said.

Guglielmi said he is optimistic that investigators will identify and locate two people they want to talk to because grainy footage shows they were in the area around the time Smollett says he was attacked.

“Somewhere out there there’s a camera that shows them arriving somewhere that they drove or walked to, or got on a bus,” he said, pointing out that the two aren’t considered suspects and that investigators want to talk to them in the hopes that they might have useful information.

Smollett, who plays the gay character Jamal Lyon on the Fox television show, is also a musician and activist primarily focused on LGBTQ issues. Advocacy groups planned a Friday evening rally in New York City in support of Smollett and LGBTQ survivors of violence."

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The parents of a Penn State sophomore who died two years ago after a night of drinking and hazing have sued 28 members of a shuttered fraternity and a security company hired to help enforce alcohol regulations. Lawyers for Tim Piazza’s parents announced the federal wrongful death lawsuit Friday and also disclosed they have reached a confidential monetary settlement with Penn State. The lawsuit says that the night of Feb. 2, 2017, Piazza was pressured to consume a large amount of alcohol in the Beta Theta Pi house and “became stuporous.”

“The fraternity defendants negligently, recklessly, and outrageously forced, coerced, encouraged or otherwise caused Pennsylvania State University sophomore Timothy Piazza to consume life-threatening amounts of alcohol, and caused him to become intoxicated, fall and suffer grievous injuries and death,” the lawsuit alleges. “For more than 11 hours after his fall, Timothy Piazza endured horrible pain and suffering, which was documented by closed-circuit cameras.” Authorities say Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, New Jersey, suffered fatal injuries in a series of falls. Medical help was not summoned until the next morning.

The building’s elaborate system of security cameras captured events as Piazza and other pledges engaged in drinking rituals. After Piazza fell down the basement steps he had to be carried up to a first-floor couch, where he spent the evening and overnight in visible agony. He was found to have suffered a fractured skull and severe abdominal bleeding, among other injuries. Not all defendants in the new federal lawsuit face the same allegations. The Piazzas allege negligence, civil conspiracy, battery and infliction of emotional distress.

The battery claims involve allegations that fraternity members physically abused Piazza while he was incapacitated.

A lawyer for St. Moritz Security Services declined comment. Messages sent to lawyers for several of defendants were not immediately returned. St. Moritz employed people who were paid to make checks of fraternity houses to see if they were complying with rules concerning hazing and drinking. A Penn State spokeswoman said its settlement with the Piazzas, who had not sued the school, codifies the university’s reforms to fraternity and sorority life and shows “our mutual commitment to promoting positive change.”

The agreement touches on safety and accountability for fraternities and sororities, encouragement of alcohol-free housing and continued training for bystander intervention and other preventative measures.

Piazza’s death resulted in criminal charges against 28 members of Beta Theta Pi, in many cases the same young men who were sued on Thursday. Nearly all of those criminal charges have been resolved. Some have pleaded guilty to mostly alcohol- or hazing-related charges and others have entered a diversion program designed for first-time, nonviolent offenders. A few defendants still face charges, but no trials are currently scheduled.

ATLANTA (AP) — Gladys Knight says her singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl will bring people together. NBC’s “Today” show reported Friday that Knight wrestled with whether to join a boycott over the NFL’s treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem. Kaepernick attorney Mark Geragos said the performers are “crossing an intellectual picket line; they’re saying to themselves, ‘I care more about my career than whether what I’m doing is right.'”

Knight said she’s been working for civil rights and singing the anthem since she was a little girl. Knight says everyone has an opinion, “but once we get into that love thing, it all comes together and goes wherever and we end up clapping and having a good time.”

NEW YORK (AP) — One of the book world’s greatest mysteries is finally ending: J.D. Salinger’s son says previously unpublished work by his late father will be coming out. In comments that appeared Friday in The Guardian, Matt Salinger confirmed longstanding reports that the author of “The Catcher in the Rye” had continued to write decades after he stopped publishing books. He said that he and Salinger’s widow, Colleen, are “going as fast as we freaking can” to prepare the material for release.

“He wanted me to pull it together, and because of the scope of the job, he knew it would take a long time,” Salinger said of his father, who died in 2010 and had not published work since the mid-1960s. “This was somebody who was writing for 50 years without publishing, so that’s a lot of material. So there’s not reluctance or protectiveness: When it’s ready, we’re going to share it,” he said.

CHICAGO (AP) — First he was attacked on the street. Now “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says he’s being beaten up on social media. Smollett has issued a statement disputing rumors flying around online that he’s been less than forthcoming with police in Chicago investigating the attack. He says he has been honest and “consistent on every level” with authorities.

Smollett told police he was set upon early Tuesday by two men who peppered their blows with racist and anti-gay language. So far, authorities haven’t turned up surveillance video showing the attack. But they have found clips of Smollett returning to his apartment with a rope around his neck — a rope he says his assailants put on him. Meanwhile, authorities continue scouring through surveillance video in an effort to find those responsible for the attack.

CHICAGO (AP) — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett issued a statement through a spokesman Friday in response to what he told police was a racist and homophobic attack by two masked men in downtown Chicago earlier this week. Here it is:

“Beautiful People,

Let me start by saying that I’m ok. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.

As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident. We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident but I need a moment to process. Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love. It’s all I know. And that can’t be kicked out of me.

With Love, respect & honor…

Jussie.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has resonated with many people. That’s because he is, like the character he plays on TV, both black and gay — and he says his attackers not only beat him, but also hurled racist and anti-gay comments at him. This evening, members of black and gay right organizations are literally rallying to his defense. Several black activist and LGBTQ groups are planning to hold a rally in New York City. Organizers say they will demonstrate against attacks on Smollett and other victims of violent hate crimes.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Mariah Carey continues to get blowback for performing a concert in Saudi Arabia. She is the biggest star to take the stage in the kingdom since it began loosening decades of restrictions on entertainment, music and other forms of fun. But some activists say Carey was used — or let herself be used — by the Saudi government to polish its image after last year’s killing and dismemberment of a Saudi journalist who wrote for The Washington Post. For her part, Carey, through her reps, says she sees yesterday’s concert as a way to advance gender equality. Some critics have begun reaching out to Carey directly — through her Twitter account.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Tom Wolf is renewing his call for lawmakers to toughen Pennsylvania’s gun laws, after a truck driver walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue and fatally shot 11 people. The Democratic governor spoke Tuesday at an anti-gun violence rally in the Capitol. He was joined by the wife of a man badly wounded in Oct. 27’s synagogue shooting and a trauma surgeon who helped treat the victims.

The Republican-controlled Legislature last year passed legislation forcing people in Pennsylvania with a domestic violence ruling against them to more quickly surrender their guns. However, the Legislature has long resisted gun-control measures, such as expanding background checks. The House’s Republican majority leader, Bryan Cutler, says Pennsylvania already has fairly comprehensive background checks and says policymakers instead might find agreement on mental health interventions.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s Senate is resuming a push to make the Eastern hellbender the state’s official amphibian, an effort to highlight the plight of a creature whose numbers researchers say are declining because of pollution in rivers and streams. The bill emerged unanimously Tuesday from a Senate committee. A previous bill died last year in the House, where it encountered competing legislation promoting the Wehrle’s salamander.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the hellbender is an aquatic salamander that can grow up to two feet long, making them the largest North American amphibian. They are nocturnal and prefer shallow, fast streams with rocks to live under. Wehrle’s salamander legislation hasn’t been re-introduced. The common salamander is a few inches in length and found in upland forests across the eastern United States.

PITTSBURGH (AP) – Hate crimes charged in Pittsburgh synagogue massacre case. A man accused of opening fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October, killing 11 people and wounding seven others, now faces additional counts that include allegations of hate crimes. A federal grand jury Tuesday added 19 charges to the 44 counts previously levied against Robert Bowers of Baldwin, Pennsylvania.

Thirteen of the new counts against the 46-year-old Bowers are hate crime violations and the others accuse him of obstructing religious beliefs and discharging a firearm during crimes of violence. Messages left for Bowers’ lawyers weren’t immediately returned. Bowers had previously pleaded not guilty to counts including using a firearm to commit murder and obstruction of religious exercise resulting in death. Prosecutors say they’ve added a wounded officer to the allegations, making a total of five. Two congregants were also injured.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A new report says Pennsylvania should adopt a number of improvements to make its elections more secure, encouraging the replacement of older voting machines, enhanced security of voter lists and better planning for cyberattacks and other technological challenges. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Pennsylvania’s Election Security report issued Tuesday says the General Assembly should do more to help counties pay for machines that produce a voter-marked paper record.

The commission also is endorsing mandatory postelection audits. The group warns that the United States’ adversaries will be increasing efforts to influence the election system during the coming 2020 presidential contest. About four in five Pennsylvania voters use machines that lack an auditable paper trail, although state officials have directed counties to have paper-record voting machines in place by next year.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania health officials have confirmed the first child flu-related death of this year’s flu season. The Morning Call reports the state Department of Health announced the child’s death in its weekly influenza report for the week ending Jan. 26. The child’s name and age have not been released. Health officials say there have been 25 adult flu-related deaths so far, an increase of 10 from its report two weeks ago.

The health department continues to classify the flu as widespread in the state, with the southeast and northwest regions hit the hardest. There have been a total of 19,757 laboratory-confirmed flu cases this season.

Last year’s record flu season saw a total of 121,300 cases and 256 deaths.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A five-term Republican state senator from western Pennsylvania says he’s leaving his seat with two years left in his term. Sen. Don White of Indiana County announced Tuesday that he’ll resign at the end of February. He’ll become the third Republican state senator to depart this year. The 69-year-old White was first elected in 2000 and is the longtime chairman of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee.

There’s an April 2 special election to fill an open seat in suburban Pittsburgh vacated by Congress-bound Guy Reschenthaler. Meanwhile, Sen. Rich Alloway of Franklin County announced he’s resigning at the end of February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman must set a special election to fill White’s term through 2020. White’s district includes Armstrong and Indiana counties and parts of Butler and Westmoreland counties.

CHICAGO (AP) — Authorities in Chicago say they’re investigating the attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett as a hate crime. The actor says he was beaten by two men who shouted racist and anti-gay slurs. Police didn’t reveal Smollett’s name as the victim — but Fox, which airs “Empire,” did. Smollett, who’s 36, says he was walking near the Chicago River early yesterday when two men set upon him, shouting at him, hitting him in the face, pouring a liquid on him — and wrapping a rope around his neck. Smollett told police one man told him he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

UNDATED (AP) — Apple has decided to pull the plug on the group-chat function of its FaceTime service. The move comes after users reported a software bug could let callers activate another person’s microphone remotely. Because of the defect, a FaceTime user who calls another iPhone, iPad or Mac computer could hear the audio of the other device, even if the receiver doesn’t accept the call. Apple didn’t acknowledge the flaw until after people began demonstrating the problem through videos online. It’s more of an embarrassment to Apple because the company has tried to distinguish itself from other firms by stressing its commitment to users’ privacy.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Police dispatchers are trained to deal with a number of situations, and a dispatcher in Indiana had to know her numbers when a boy called 911 seeking help with his homework. Lafayette Police dispatcher Antonia Bundy answered the call from the boy, who said he had “a bad day at school.” It seemed the boy had “tons of homework” before the dispatcher narrowed down that he was having trouble with fractions.

An audio recording of the call posted on Twitter shows how the dispatcher helped the child solve the equation: three-fourths plus one-fourth. She had him take out a piece of paper to figure out the answer: one. The boy thanked the dispatcher and apologized for calling 911. Police say they don’t recommend calling 911 for homework help.

During a preview clip for the episode Friday, the CNN news anchor opened up about the often difficult intersection of being black and gay. Like Smollett, Lemon is openly gay.

""For black, gay men – historically, black men have stayed in the closet – you have to decide, 'Do I want to be black, or do I want to be gay?' And sometimes some of us say we're too black to be gay or are we too gay to be black,"" he told host Jada Pinkett Smith.

He continued, ""So you've got it from your own folks or from the larger community, and it hurts. It's a weight.""

The full episode of ""Red Table Talk"" will be released Monday, Feb. 11.

“If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed,” she tweeted. “Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes it severe. Full stop. Sending love to all.”

Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop. Sending love to all — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 9, 2019

Page on Thursday criticized Chris Pratt for attending a “infamously anti-LGBTQ” church after he appeared on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and discussed his religious side.

The “Guardians of the Galaxy” star sat down with Colbert to promote “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” and Pratt said he just finished a 21-day Daniel Fast that he took part in through his church and that his pastor encouraged. He also said the pastor shared with him words of wisdom about balancing fame and his inner self.

“If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that’s within you, it will kill you,” Pratt recounted to Colbert.

Page tweeted about the appearance and the pastor shortly after, writing, “Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?”

Pratt attends Hillsong Church, which other celebrities like Kendall and Kylie Jenner and Justin Bieber have also flocked to. The megachurch was founded in Australia but now has locations in New York City and Los Angeles.

Carl Lentz, who leads the New York branch, came under fire for saying in 2015 that homosexuality is a sin and that a gay member could never hold a leadership position. And that same year, when two male choir members of the church got married, Brian Houston, the church’s global senior pastor, released a statement against them.

Pratt’s rep did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.

Page, who appeared in the “X-Men” films as Kitty Pryde and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007 for her role in “Juno,” came out as gay in 2014 and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights. She co-hosted the 2016 Viceland documentary series “Gaycation” about LGBTQ cultures around the world.

She appeared on the “Late Show” Jan. 31 ahead of the premiere of her Netflix series “The Umbrella Academy.” There, she spoke out against the racist, homophobic attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, and condemned Vice President Mike Pence’s anti-LGBTQ policies and his support of conversion therapy.

“If you are in a position of power and you hate people, and you want to cause suffering to them — you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen?” Page said. “Kids are going to be abused, and they’re going to kill themselves. And people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you can meet. I am lucky to have this time and this privilege to say this. This needs to f—ing stop.”"

The outspoken liberal actress, who has starred in “Juno” and the “X-Men” franchise, declared herself the moral judge over Pratt’s outspoken faith and his church which she condemned for being “infamously” anti-LGBTQ.

Page reacted to Pratt’s recent appearance on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert where the “Jurassic World” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star opened up about his faith and his recent 21-day diet inspired by the Bible story of Daniel.

“I was inspired by my pastor to do it. It’s kind of like our Lent, you know, you give something up,” Pratt told Colbert. “So, for 21 days I had no meat, no sugar, no alcohol, and it was actually amazing. It was really cool.”

Page felt compelled to shame Pratt for his beliefs and for the church he attends, tweeting out that Colbert should have confronted the “Avengers” star about the church’s stance on LGBTQ issues.

Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too? https://t.co/meg8m69FeF — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 8, 2019

“Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles,” Pastor Brian Houston wrote in a blog post from 2015. “Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid. I recognise this one statement alone is upsetting to people on both sides of this discussion, which points to the complexity of the issue for churches all over the world.”

Page, who last week blamed an alleged hate crime against “Empire” star Jussie Smollett on Vice President Mike Pence, seemed to think Pratt owed her some sort of explanation.

The 31-year-old actress, who doesn’t seem to have posed the anti-LGBTQ question to members of other faiths such as Islam, was called out on social media for her hypocrisy and for attempting to shame Pratt, who is beloved by fans and openly shares his Christian faith.

“Do you ever feel like you’re in the lion’s den, being a celebrity in the public eye?” Colbert asked the 39-year-old actor.

“There’s this great quote I heard in church,” Pratt replied, “and it felt really appropriate, which was ‘If the spotlight that’s shining on you is brighter than the light that comes from within you, it will kill you.’ And you see it all the time.”

Some words of wisdom that Page could benefit from.

Twitter users and fans of Pratt had plenty of words of their own for Page.

“Casablanca,” I’ll say with all the enthusiasm of someone ordering a fruit plate for dessert. But in truth, it’s My Best Friend’s Wedding. When George (Rupert Everett) reassures Jules (Julia Roberts), “Maybe there won’t be marriage. Maybe there won’t be sex. But by God, there’ll be dancing,” I melt. It’s a resolution that’s unexpected, yet reassuring and heartwarming.

Conway babbled to CNN that she was at Uncle Julio’s in Bethesda, Maryland sometime last year and “Somebody was grabbing me from behind, grabbing my arms, and was shaking me to the point where I felt maybe somebody was hugging me. She was out of control. I don’t even know how to explain her to you. She was just, her whole face was terror and anger. She was right here, and my daughter was right there. She ought to pay for that.” While we don’t condone violence, maybe the elderly woman was thinking about mothers being torn apart from the children at the border of Mexico and didn’t appreciate that irony of her chowing down at a Mexican restaurant.

According to Raw Story, “The alleged assailant, a woman named Mary Elizabeth Inabinett, left the restaurant before Conway called 911 to report the alleged assault. Inabinnett has subsequently been charged with second-degree assault and disorderly conduct, although her attorney says she denies the charges and plans to plead not guilty at her trial next month.”

Her attorney said in a statement, “Ms. Inabinett saw Kellyanne Conway, a public figure, in a public place, and exercised her First Amendment right to express her personal opinions. She did not assault Ms. Conway. The facts at trial will show this to be true, and show Ms. Conway’s account to be false.”

Back on June 22, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders wasn’t welcomed with open arms at Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. The owner of Red Hen, Stephanie Wilkinson, said to The Washington Post at the time that some of her staff were uncomfortable, including the LGBT staffers, due to Sanders support of a ban on transgender people in the military and a gay couple being refused to have a wedding cake baked for them because of religion.

She said, “I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation.” She also offered the other people the chance to stay, but they refused and what little they ordered, Red Hen gave to them on the house.

If you put on hate and lies, don’t be surprised if you get push back. Being that Conway believes in “alternative facts,” we’ll wait until a court decides if she is telling the truth.

This week, while promoting his new film The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part with an appearance on The Late Show, Pratt discussed the fast, which he'd recently completed, and his spiritual beliefs; Pratt and his fiancée Katherine Schwarzenegger are regular attendees of celebrity-loved Christian megachurch Hillsong.

While many on the Internet were impressed by his commitment, plenty more, including Ellen Page, were not. In response to an article covering Pratt's discussion of his ""spiritual side,"" Page tweeted, ""Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?""

Hillsong and its leaders have been repeatedly accused of homophobia and of encouraging LGBTQ members to attend gay conversion therapy. In a statement published in 2015, Hillsong founder and senior pastor Brian Houston wrote, ""I do believe God's word is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman."" He continued, ""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid."" (In the same statement, Houston also made a passing reference to Islamophobia, writing, ""Bobbie and I were in an elevator today with a Saudi Arabian woman dressed in Muslim attire.... As she left we said to each other, 'What a lovely lady.' Does that mean I now endorse her religion? No it doesn't."")

Since the Australia-founded Hillsong first expanded to the U.S. with the establishment of a New York City outpost in 2010, it has amassed an especially starry following, including members like Pratt, Justin Bieber, Hailey Baldwin, and Selena Gomez. While many of these members are outspoken about their faith, none have commented on the accusations of their church's homophobia.

During her own recent visit to The Late Show, while promoting her new Netflix series The Umbrella Academy last week, Page delivered an impassioned speech about other notoriously anti-LGBTQ leaders, including Vice President Mike Pence. ""We have a media that's saying it's a debate whether what just happened to Jussie Smollett is a hate crime. It's absurd. This shit isn't a debate,"" she said. ""Sorry, I'm really fired up tonight. But it feels impossible to not feel this way right now, with the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, who wishes I couldn't be married. Let's just be clear. The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana; he believes in conversion therapy; he has hurt LGBTQ people so badly as the governor of Indiana.""

Ellen Page is calling out Chris Pratt for promoting his church, which she calls “anti-LGBT.”

Pratt, 39, stopped by the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night where he opened up about the Bible-inspired fast that he’d just finished.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“I was inspired by my pastor,” Pratt said of taking on the Daniel Fast. According to its website, the Daniel Fast is “based on the fasting experiences of the Old Testament Prophet,” and serves to help people “draw nearer to God.”

“It’s kind of like our Lent, you know, give something up. So for 21 days I had no meat, no sugar, no alcohol, and it was actually amazing. It was really cool,” Pratt said.

Pratt then when on to talk about how his church has helped him deal with the pressures of fame and being in the spotlight. The Lego Movie 2 actor has been seen attending several services at Hillsong Church — a popular congregation for Hollywood A-Listers like Pratt, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and the Kardashians — and other related churches.

In response to a Hollywood Reporter article about Pratt’s appearance on the Late Show, Page, 31, tweeted, “Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?”

Representatives for Pratt, Page and Hillsong Church did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.

In 2015, Hillsong and its pastor Brian Houston came under fire for his stance on the gay community. Houston posted a lengthy blog post about the subject, where he wrote he held “traditional Christian thought on gay lifestyles and gay marriage.”

“I do believe God’s word is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman,” he continued. “The writings of the apostle Paul in scripture on the subject of homosexuality are also clear, as I have mentioned in previous public statements.”

Houston went on to write that “Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.”

The pastor also clarified that members of the LGBTQ community “are welcome to attend, worship with us, and participate as a congregation member with the assurance that you are personally included and accepted,” but outlined that they wouldn’t be able to hold positions of leadership within the church.

Page’s tweet comes a week after the actress delivered a moving speech about the LGBTQ community on the Late Show. The actress got emotional as she spoke about the apparent hate crime against gay actor Jussie Smollett just days before and how she links that violence to Vice President Mike Pence, who has pushed for conversion therapy for gay people in the past, and the Trump administration.

Investigators are now considering a possible link between threatening mail sent to the actor, and his violent assault on the night of January 29. At least one letter sent to Smollett referred to him as a “black f*g” just days before the attack.

The Empire star and out-gay actor landed in the hospital following an attack on the streets of Chicago. Unknown assailants assaulted Smollett, shouting racist and homophobic slurs, dousing the actor in corrosive chemicals, beating him and tying a noose around his neck. Smollett spent time in the hospital before returning to work on the Empire set.

According to reports, the FBI has coordinated with a private security firm hired to screen mail sent to the cast of the show, which has a history of receiving threatening letters. Police also are currently analyzing camera footage taken in the area of the attack in hopes of identifying a suspect.

Law enforcement is also investigating the attack as a possible hate crime."

Leon W. Russell, Chairman of the NAACP National Board of Directors, will present Congresswoman Waters with the award at the 50th NAACP Image Awards on March 30, 2019 live at 9pm/8c on TV One.

“I am honored to present the Chairman’s Award to Congresswoman Waters, considered to be one of the most powerful women in American politics today and an inspiration to many,” said Mr. Russell. “Her 43 years of public service, first in the California State Assembly and then in the U.S. House of Representatives, have benefited countless Americans. As both a queen and a warrior, Congresswoman Waters has stood the test of time in her refusal to stand idle in the face of the relentless assaults on the humanity of African Americans and people of color. We salute her and her amazing legacy.”

Past honorees of the NAACP Chairman’s Award include William Lucy, Tyler Perry, Ruby Dee, The Neville Brothers, Bono, Danny Glover, Former Vice President Al Gore and Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai, then-Senator Barack Obama, Former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, TV One Founder and Chairman Cathy Hughes, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michele Howard, Brittany “Bree” Newsome, Justice League NYC, University of Missouri Concerned Student 1950 Collective, University of Mississippi NAACP College Chapter, Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley, Rev. Dr. Jamal Harrison Bryant, Jussie Smollett, and Dr. Charles J. Ogletree, Jr.

Throughout her many years of public service, Congresswoman Maxine Waters has been on the cutting edge, tackling difficult and often controversial issues. She has combined her strong legislative and public policy acumen and high visibility in Democratic Party activities with an unusual ability to do grassroots organizing.

Following the Los Angeles civil unrest in 1992, Congresswoman Waters faced the nation’s media and public to interpret the hopelessness and despair in cities across America. Over the years, she has brought many government officials and policy makers to her South-Central L.A. district to appeal for more resources.

She has used her skill to shape public policy and deliver the goods: $10 billion in Section 108 loan guarantees to cities for economic and infrastructure development, housing and small business expansion; $50 million appropriation for “Youth Fair Chance” program which established an intensive job and life skills training program for unskilled, unemployed youth; expanded U.S. debt relief for Africa and other developing nations; creating a “Center for Women Veterans,” among others.

She is a co-founder of Black Women’s Forum, a nonprofit organization of over 1,200 African American women in the Los Angeles area. In the mid-80s, she also founded Project Build, working with young people in Los Angeles housing developments on job training and placement.

As she confronts the issues such as poverty, economic development, equal justice under the law and other issues of concern to people of color, women, children, and poor people, Rep. Waters enjoys a broad cross section of support from diverse communities across the nation.

Throughout her career, Congresswoman Waters has been an advocate for international peace, justice, and human rights. Before her election to Congress, she was a leader in the movement to end Apartheid and establish democracy in South Africa. She opposed the 2004 Haitian coup d’etat, which overthrew the democratically-elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, and defends the rights of political prisoners in Haiti’s prisons. She leads congressional efforts to cancel the debts that poor countries in Africa and Latin America owe to wealthy institutions like the World Bank and free poor countries from the burden of international debts.

Expanding access to health care services is another of Congresswoman Waters’ priorities. She spearheaded the development of the Minority AIDS Initiative in 1998 to address the alarming spread of HIV/AIDS among African Americans, Hispanics and other minorities. Under her continuing leadership, funding for the Minority AIDS Initiative has increased from the initial appropriation of $156 million in fiscal year 1999 to approximately $400 million per year today. She is also the author of legislation to expand health services for patients with diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

She is lauded by African American entrepreneurs for her work to expand contracting and procurement opportunities and to strengthen businesses. Long active in the women’s movement, Rep. Waters has given encouragement and financial support to women seeking public office. Many young people, including those in the hip-hop music community, praise her for her support and understanding of young people and their efforts at self-expression. One testament to her work is the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center, a multimillion-dollar campus providing education and employment opportunities to residents of the Watts area.

As previously announced, the production team will be Executive Producers Reginald Hudlin and Phil Gurin, Tony McCuin as Director, Byron Phillips as Co-Executive Producer, Robin Reinhardt as Producer and Rachel Frimer as Executive in Charge of Production.

Jussie Smollett is in the hot seat after there have been several reports that the openly gay actor may have possibly filed a false report to police. If that’s the case, the Chicago Police Department promises to charge Smollett for making a false police report in regards to the alleged hate crime perpetrated against him on January 29th.

The investigation is still ongoing, but with the Empire actor refusing to hand his phone over to authorities, the 36-year old actor will have a hard time proving his case and avoiding jail time as his alleged assailants have managed to do.

In the meantime, Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson vehemently states on social media that if Smollett is found to not be telling the truth he will be charged.

Pratt, 39, who recently did a 21-day fast through his church, attends services at LA’s Zoe Church and Hillsong, which is also frequented by the likes of Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin.

After seeing The Hollywood Reporter‘s tweet about Pratt’s interview on Colbert, Page, who is openly gay, mentioned the actor’s church was “infamously anti-LGBTQ.”

Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too? https://t.co/meg8m69FeF — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 8, 2019

RELATED: Chris Pratt Confirms ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3’ Will Use James Gunn’s ‘Off The Chain’ Script

Hillsong’s leader Brian Houston previously wrote on the church’s official website that although the institution “welcomes all people,” he added that he “does not affirm the gay lifestyle.”

He explained at the time, “If you are gay, are you welcome at Hillsong Church? Of course! You are welcome to attend, worship with us, and participate as a congregation member with the assurance that you are personally included and accepted within our community.”

“But (this is where it gets vexing), can you take an active leadership role? No. This won’t make everyone happy and to some, this stance may even be seen as hypocritical. We are a gay welcoming church but we are not a church that affirms a gay lifestyle.”

ET Canada has reached out to Pratt’s rep for comment.

Page’s comments come after she spoke to Stephen Colbert about the apparent homophobic and racist attack on actor Jussie Smollett.

She said of her own experience as a young actress growing up in the industry: “In terms of the level of misogyny and homophobia I’ve dealt with, it’s been really unfortunate. It was very hard for me and I dealt with a lot of stuff that was totally normalized since really young.”

On Saturday, Page followed up her earlier comment with an even more pointed jab at Pratt.

“If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed,” she wrote. “Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop.”"

Thus far, surveillance footage from mutliple sources has turned up empty, and the rope still hanging around Smollett’s neck when he arrived at his apartment is turning out to be a key piece of the investigation.

After nearly two weeks of investigating, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, the Chicago PD “has gathered little traction in finding the perpetrators.”

“Police continue to review security camera footage and are trying to identify two people of interest seen walking down the sidewalk in one video. Their faces are silhouetted and not recognizable,” the paper reports. “Investigators haven’t yet found footage of the attack.”

“We’re looking at shreds of detail. We’re painfully slow because we’re methodical,” said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the Journal reports.

A key component of the investigation is the rope Smollett says the assaulters terrifyingly wrapped around his neck while attacking him and hurling racial and homophobic slurs and allegedly yelling, “Welcome to MAGA country!”

“Police say they’re trying to determine the origin of the rope that was used in the alleged attack,” CBS Chicago reported Thursday. “Detectives are looking into where it came from or where it may have been purchased.”

Guglielmi explained that investigators have identified retailers who sell that particularly type of rope and will use that information to glean potential evidence, including any additional surveillance footage, the Journal notes.

Like the Journal, CBS notes in its report that “the alleged attack has not been seen on any surveillance video so far.” While police told CBS that they are still in the process of “following up on leads,” they have “found nothing new to report from additional video they got over weekend from the hotel and apartment building where Smollett lives, video from another hotel nearby and traffic cameras in the area.” An official with the department who reviewed the tapes said the video from Smollett’s building shows him “entering with what appears to be a noose around his neck,” the outlet reports.

The only surveillance footage that has provided a possible clue about potential perpetrators is footage of two men dressed in dark clothing, but police have thus far been unable to identify them, and some sources close to the police department have suggested to reporters the two men might be homeless. The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti reports:

Although two individuals were pictured on security cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked, sources close to CPD told local media that those two individuals appear to be homeless and were in the vicinity between 15 and 30 minutes before Smollett arrived back at his apartment on East Water Street, just north of the Chicago River. Chicago Police also reportedly dismissed a neighbor’s claim that a “redneck”-looking man was loitering behind Smollett’s apartment building, according to Chicago crime watch blog, CWB Chicago.

Sources close to the Chicago Police Department told The Daily Wire that police have filed subpoenas to gain access to Smollett’s phone records from the night of the attack, Zanotti reports.

As kids, we used to run outside with our arms stretched like airplane wings while making engine noises. As adults, we stand on the mirror side of our aviator sunglasses and imagine the reflection is Tom Cruise’s character “Maverick” in Top Gun. And just like that, that little boy dream turns into a bucket list desire. So, imagine my horror when I almost missed out on both.

I’m 195 miles southeast of Paris, France, in Dijon known for its Burgundy wine and mustard.

I’m knocked out in my hotel room, hugging my pillow, exhausted from traveling 14 hours the day before, when my phone rings. Anyone who has heard that ring knows the terror of being late, but Kate, with her calm British accent, let me know everyone was outside waiting and I had exactly 15 minutes to get ready. I frantically surveyed the room, took a deep yogi breath, and then rushed into the bathroom to brush my teeth, get dress, pack my bag and make it downstairs into the van.

Kate is a rep for Breitling, the Swiss watch company founded in 1884, famous amongst pilots for their Navitimer watches. As a Breitling Brand Ambassador, I was invited to Dijon to fly with the Breitling Jet Team, who happened to be the largest non-military flyers in the world. They perform their aerobatics in L-39C Albatros, Czech in twin-seater military training jets.

As we pull up to the Breitling hanger a rush of energy comes over me. I’m the first one to hop out, of the van, run to the fence and gawk at the immaculate black, anthracite and metal gray livery painted jets parked on the ramp. I’m just a kid from the South side of Chicago and this moment feels surreal; but first, I need to record an IG Story video because if it’s not on the gram, it never happened.

A Dream Come True

I’m welcomed into the Pilot Club’s social club which is decorated with Breitling’s signature blue and yellow colors on the walls amidst photos of their jet teams taken from around the world. I shake hands with my pilot Patrick “Gaston” Marchand, a former French military pilot who has flown with the team since 2005. Patrick informs me we’re flying together in jet#7 and tells me to do what I love to the most—eat. I stuff my face with croissants and drink coffee to make up for missing breakfast, but the bigger reason is to combat possible air sickness from the G-forces (G’s) I will encounter during the flight.

We move to the Survival Room and receive our black, pilot jumpsuits. Pulling up zipper makes me feels like donning a graduation cap and gown and once I’m fully in it, I let out a long sigh of gratitude. The final piece of the outfit is my yellow pilot helmet with its retractable sun visor and two-way radio. I look in the mirror, and yup, that’s me, the chocolate version of Maverick.

Fully suited and booted, we watch a safety training video and the most important part covers how to safely eject in case of an emergency. Eject!?!? Uh Oh, this just got really real! At this moment, my excitement takes a pause and I pay close attention to every safety detail.

I also learn about the flying formations and how to prepare for the 5 G’s expected during the aerobatic maneuvers. During certain points of the flight we will fly away from the Earth and the gravitational force will create pressure five times my 192lbs. weight in my body. The remedy is to squeeze my core and blow short breaths when I start feeling heavy, otherwise the G’s could cause me to blackout.

Yoga in a cockpit—Namaste.



Time to fly

Gaston and I finally proceed to the ramp and we’re greeted by his jet’s engineer. He helps me climb into the cockpit, secures my safety harness, plugs my helmet into the plane to communicate with Gaston, and points out that the ejection button is active. He instructs me to keep my hands placed on my safety harness the entire flight. The cockpit is a tight space with various buttons and gauges on the console that are equally important and foreign to my eyes.

While Gaston and the engineer cycle through their safety checks, I’m overwhelmed with bucket list joy rotating my head at 180 degrees so I can take in every moment. I’m seconds away from flying in a Breitling fighter jet while wearing a Breitling pilot watch. I sit enthusiastically waiting as jet #1 starts the taxi procession down the runway. We bring up the rear like the last person in a second line parade. Gaston asks me one last time if I’m ready, and I excitedly respond, ‘Yes!’ At that moment, all seven jets take off simultaneously into Dijon’s airspace.

The takeoff was swift and smooth. We climbed to elevation, cruise through the clouds at 466 mph then speed into a loop and “B One” band. Essentially, we do a backflip ascending perpendicular to Earth’s surface. It feels like I’m inside an iPhone slo-motion video, while I gaze upside upon the panoramic view below me. Here comes those 5 G’s, so I engage my core and puff short breaths. It worked! I don’t black out or vomit. I roar in excitement and marvel at the artistry of all the planes flying with synchronized precision.

As we come out of the loop, we reach a breakneck speed of 565 mph and go into a dive. Gaston is really having fun. He playfully checks in to makes sure I’m ok, then flips the script and flies us into a 360 degree circular spin, turning like a combination lock. As we level off, I look over to my right and exchange fist pumps and Kool-Aid wide smiles with the other Brand Ambassadors. This is the ride of my life, and if I missed anything the first time, no worries, because we circle around to do it again! After 30 minutes in the air we return to the terra firma.

Although my feet are on the ground, my head is still in the clouds. I just lived every boy’s dream (for that matter, every grown man’s dream.) For 30 minutes today, I was a fighter pilot thanks to Breitling—and thanks to Kate for waking me up.

If you’re a Breitling customer and are interested in flying with the Breitling Jet Team, send me a DM on Instagram @worldwidenate and I can put you in touch the dream makers.

The newly engaged Chris Pratt spoke about his ‘spiritual side’ on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ironically the show that Ellen made her badass speech on, and she had some words to say about it.

The 39-year old Jurassic World actor is admittedly very religious and identifies as a non-denominational Christian, attending services at the Zoe Church and Hillsong, also attended by Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin.

Replying to Pratt's comments, Ellen wrote to Twitter; ""Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti-LGBT+ so maybe address that too?""

Page has just celebrated her one-year-anniversary with her wife Emma Portner last month, and famously speaks out against homophobic attacks like the recent horrible incident involving Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

In 2015 Brian Houston, leader of Hillsong, has said that while gay people are welcome to worship there, and that he loves all people, Hillsong doesn’t ‘affirm’ the gay ‘lifestyle’. Whatever the heck that means.

""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.""

""Can you take an active leadership role? No. ‘This won’t make everyone happy and to some, this stance may even be seen as hypocritical. We are a gay welcoming church but we are not a church that affirms a gay lifestyle."" Alright then…

Famous pastor of Justin Bieber, Carl Lentz, said he admits he doesn’t know what Jesus would think about homosexuality, saying:

""Jesus was in the thick of an era where homosexuality, just like it is today, was widely prevalent. And I’m still waiting for someone to show me the quote where Jesus addressed it on the record in front of people. You won’t find it because he never did.""

Pratt spoke on the show about how his church helps him to deal with fame, and has yet to respond to Ellen's tweet.

Sources told TMZ that Empire hired a private security company to set up a system of screening all mail received by the cast with the FBI.

Smollett and other members of the Empire cast have reportedly been sent hate mail previously.

However, security are on high alert following Smollett’s assault.

Smollett was hospitalised in a suspected “racially-charged assault” in Chicago on January 29, during which he was subjected to homophobic slurs and had a chemical substance poured on him.

The FBI are searching for the people responsible for sending Empire star Jussie Smollett hate mail days before he was assaulted in a suspected homophobic and racist attack in Chicago.

According to TMZ, the FBI is working with the Empire crew to hunt down the person or people behind a threatening letter sent to Smollett in the days leading up to his assault.

Sources told TMZ that Empire hired a private security company to set up a system of screening all mail received by the cast with the FBI.

Tim Scott don’t come to mind. They can’t even admit their president is a racist. Nonetheless, these are the two people the GOP has chosen to tap dance for Black History Month.

The Charleston County Republican Party was having their second annual (second? aren’t they about 20 years behind?) Black History Month event Friday. After Carson abruptly canceled, Scott happily replaced him.

“We wanted to have somebody transcendent. This event is in its crucial second year, and we wanted to make sure it remained memorable and inspirational,” Party Chairman Larry Kobrovsky told The Post and Courier this week.

The only memorable element is that they will have a Black Senator in their presence, which will probably be predominately white, who will continue to excuse Trump’s racism.

“He sees this as an opportunity,” Kobrovksy said about Scott. “I think he feels he has something important to say and will speak from the heart. That’s who he is and who he has always been.”

In an interview published on Tuesday, Scott told the Wall Street Journal, “I’ve been in public life for 25 years almost, and I’ve been reluctant for about 22 of those 25 years. Scott is 53 year old Black man who represents the state of South Carolina — how strange for a Black, elected official to be ‘reluctant’ to talk about race for 22 years.”

Scott claimed Trayvon Martin was his wake up call. He also said, “I am not ‘the Black senator.’ I am not ‘the Black Republican.’ I am a United States senator with the responsibilities of every other senator, and in addition to that, I have the unusual position of being the only conservative African-American in the Senate.”

It’s not that unusual. Most African-Americans would not want to be in a party of racists that is 90 percent white and male. Nonetheless, if Scott truly believes he speaks out on racism then he would need to speak out on Trump.

Back in March, he said about Trump in an interview with Politico, “I am not unaware of the president’s past,’ he tells me. A long pause. ‘Do you think he’s a racist?’ I ask. Scott shakes his head. ‘I don’t. I don’t,’ he replies. ‘Is he racially insensitive? Yes. But is he a racist? No.'” He stressed the same offensiveness to the Wall Street Journal by saying, “I think he’s had some racial insensitivities. The progress we’ve made, I think, is more important than the rhetoric.” If you considering rolling back Obama-era prison reforms, tearing apart children at the border, or a tax break that allowed General Motors to lay off 14,000 people — then that is “progress.”

Tim Scott is an embarrassment to Black History.

Speaking to Deadline ahead of Fox’s Television Critics Association winter press tour, where they appeared on the “Voices of Drama” panel on Wednesday, Empire executive producers Brett Mahoney and Danny Strong confirmed news that the actor had returned to work.

Smollett made his return to the FOX Studios set on Monday to film the final scenes of the season and to complete a cast table read on Tuesday. His return to work came less than a week following his attack.

“He’s been back at work since Monday — he wanted to get back to work and he just wanted to get things back to normal,” Mahoney told the outlet. “He’s the heart of the show in many ways and everyone welcomed him back. We let him know we’re all family, we’re all supporting him and we all have his back. I think that helped him ease back to getting back to work.”

Smollett, who portrays the openly gay character Jamal Lyon on the FOX series and came out as gay himself in 2015, was the victim of a possible hate crime on Jan. 29 in Chicago, leaving him bruised.

“Jussie is a proud, gay black man, and I’m not sure if the cowards were trying to beat the pride, gay or black out of him but he’s strong and we’re happy he’s back at work,” Mahoney said onstage during FOX’s presentation.

“He’s truly a very special person, which is how he got cast as Jamal, because we needed someone truly special to play that part, and it was him,” Strong added. “So I’m not surprised at all by the class and the poise of his response to what has happened.”

Smollett’s return to set was aided by a number of measures to protect him, as well as the other members of the cast and crew, from any further attacks. After news of the attack broke, FOX reportedly ordered heightened security around production locations, including the presence of armed guards and occasional sweeps of the area.

FOX also hired a private security company to screen mail sent to the cast and crew of Empire in an attempt to identify any potentially dangerous mail and prevent it from reaching those working on the series. The team is reportedly working in a joint effort with the FBI, who helped them set up a protocol for screening the mail, after a threatening letter was sent to FOX Studios for Smollett in the days prior to the Jan. 29 attack.

“We’re really concerned about security for the cast and the crew. That’s the priority,” Strong said. “We’re just worried about him right now.”

Assisted by the FBI and others, the Chicago Police Department is still investigating the crime."

What is the point of making another premature statement? Is it just to plant doubts in the minds of the public. The Chicago Police Department has dropped the ball from the beginning with their handling of the case in the media. First, a police spokesperson said there was no footage of the assailants. Then, hours later , there were two “persons of interest” on video. They also claimed the “Empire” actor “ refused ” to give the cops his phone. All of these inconsistent reports have prompted some to say Smollett fabricated the attack.

“The sources say cops ‘informally asked’ Jussie if he would surrender his phone … to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked,” TMZ reported. “We’re told he felt ‘uncomfortable’ doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records. A Chicago police official had said Jussie refused to turn over both the phone and records. We’re told Smollett has already said he will provide the records, and is in the process of gathering them.”

The Chicago Police Department has also reported two different descriptions of the suspects. TMZ wrote that Jussie never said the men were wearing MAGA hats, only that they screamed “MAGA country.”

As for the rope around his neck, TMZ also explained, “There are reports that Jussie had the rope around his neck long after the incident when he was being treated at the hospital. We’re told that is not the case. He did have the rope around his neck when cops arrived at his building 42 minutes after the incident. The sources say he kept it there to ‘preserve the evidence.'”

CPD was reportedly looking for the store where the rope was bought.

On Jan. 29, while walking to a Subway, two men reportedly yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor after he exited a restaurant, investigators told The Hollywood Reporter. They allegedly punched and poured bleach on him while one of the suspects put a rope around his neck. As they fled the scene, Smollett told police they said, “This is MAGA country.”

Threatening letters directed at Smollett were reportedly sent to Fox Studios in Chicago a week before. The cutout letters read, “You will die black f**.” See below:

Hopefully, the Chicago Police Department can stop babbling to the press and focus on their investigation.

“It was shocking to me,” Blow, 59, told the New York Daily News in a phone interview. “It’s just shocking that we still have blackface representing what this country or this society is really all about.”

The state’s attorney general, Mark R. Herring, who is second in line to succeed current governor Ralph Northam who’s embroiled in his own blackface yearbook scandal, admitted this week that he dressed like Blow with a wig and blackface while in college.

But rather than joining the calls for Herring to resign, the rap icon and ordained minister actually wants to meet Herring to discuss the decision to don blackface and to pray with him.

“Christ says we need to forgive in order to receive forgiveness. It’s going to take some love to conquer the hate and racism that is apparent still in our society,” Blow added in the interview. “Love is the key, love is the answer. It’s the only way we’re going to get rid of racism, the only way to mend hearts that are hurting.”

Herring released this statement in response to the controversial confession, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports.

“The very bright light that is shining on Virginia right now is sparking a painful but, I think we all hope, important conversation. The stakes are high, and our spirits are low.

“I am sure we all have done things at one time or another in our lives that show poor judgment, and worse yet, have caused some level of pain to others. I have a glaring example from my past that I have thought about with deep regret in the many years since, and certainly each time I took a step forward in public service, realizing that my goals and this memory could someday collide and cause pain for people I care about, those who stood with me in the many years since, or those who I hoped to serve while in office.

“In 1980, when I was a 19-year-old undergraduate in college, some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song. It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes – and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others – we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup.

“This was a onetime occurrence and I accept full responsibility for my conduct.

“That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others. It was really a minimization of both people of color, and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.

“Although the shame of that moment has haunted me for decades, and though my disclosure of it now pains me immensely, what I am feeling in no way compares to the betrayal, the shock, and the deep pain that Virginians of color may be feeling. Where they have deserved to feel heard, respected, understood, and honestly represented, I fear my actions have contributed to them being forced to revisit and feel a historical pain that has never been allowed to become history.

—Jussie Smollett is back on set filming ‘Empire’ after violent attack along with trauma counselors—

“This conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.

“As a senator and as attorney general, I have felt an obligation to not just acknowledge but work affirmatively to address the racial inequities and systemic racism that we know exist in our criminal justice system, in our election processes, and in other institutions of power. I have long supported efforts to empower communities of color by fighting for access to healthcare, making it easier and simpler to vote, and twice defended the historic re-enfranchisement of former felons before the Supreme Court of Virginia. I have launched efforts to make our criminal justice system more just, fair, and equal by addressing implicit bias in law enforcement, establishing Virginia’s first-ever program to improve re-entry programs in local jails, and pushing efforts to reform the use of cash bail. And I have tried to combat the rise in hate crimes and white supremacist violence that is plaguing our Commonwealth and our country.

“That I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt. Forgiveness in instances like these is a complicated process, one that necessarily cannot and should not be decided by anyone but those directly affected by the transgressor, should forgiveness be possible or appropriate at all. In the days ahead, honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general, but no matter where we go from here, I will say that from the bottom of my heart, I am deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation.”

Kurtis Blow says no one from Herring’s office has reached out to him so far."

Ellen Page has called out Chris Pratt for attending an ‘infamously anti-LGBTQ’ church.

Chris, 39, is very religious and identifies as a non-denominational Christian, attending services at the Zoe Church and Hillsong – the church favoured by stars including Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin.

And Juno actress Ellen has now called on the Guardians Of The Galaxy star to address Hillsong’s attitude towards LGBTQ people, after Chris spoke about his ‘spiritual side’ on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Upon seeing a tweet from The Hollywood Reporter reading ‘Fresh from fasting, @prattprattpratt talks about his spiritual side’, Ellen, 31, wrote: ‘Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too?’

Ellen – who recently issued the most badass speech in the wake of the attack on Jussie Smollett – is openly gay and celebrated her first anniversary with wife Emma Portner last month.

Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too? https://t.co/meg8m69FeF — Ellen Page (@EllenPage) February 8, 2019

The actress’s followers praised her for speaking out on the church, which has been accused of anti-LGBTQ behaviour in the past.

Hillsong’s leader Brian Houston has said that while gay people are welcome to worship at the church, and that loves all people, Hillsong doesn’t ‘affirm’ the gay ‘lifestyle’.

In a statement in 2015, Houston said: ‘Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.

‘So if you are gay, are you welcome at Hillsong Church? Of course! You are welcome to attend, worship with us, and participate as a congregation member with the assurance that you are personally included and accepted within our community. But (this is where it gets vexing), can you take an active leadership role? No.

‘This won’t make everyone happy and to some, this stance may even be seen as hypocritical. We are a gay welcoming church but we are not a church that affirms a gay lifestyle.’

And in the Australia same-sex marriage vote, the pastor said: ‘Hillsong’s position on homosexuality and gay marriage has not changed and is consistent with Scripture.’

Meanwhile, pastor Carl Lentz said he admits he doesn’t know what Jesus would think about homosexuality, saying: ‘Jesus was in the thick of an era where homosexuality, just like it is today, was widely prevalent. And I’m still waiting for someone to show me the quote where Jesus addressed it on the record in front of people. You won’t find it because he never did.’

Chris, however, did not mention any of this on Colbert, as he discussed how religion helps him deal with fame.

The star, who has just got engaged to Katherine Schwarzenegger, recalled a quote he heard in church: ‘If the spotlight that is shining on you is brighter than the light that’s within you, it will kill you.’

Chris said: ‘Sometimes just having a self to share is what kills you, because there’s nothing left. So you have to have a light to share. A light that’s just a bright as any of these lights.

Last week two officers from the BPD were seen on a viral video violently pushing an elderly man to the ground during a protest.

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the officers – part of the tactical team that responds to protests and civil unrest – plead not guilty to second-degree assault charges and were released without bail. After the decision to charge the officers, the remaining members of the tactical team resigned. (See EUR coverage here).

While grappling with that, the BPD now must answer to some old police brutality questions that have plagued the department for years – and one of the cases involves Cariol Horne back in 2006.

Horne, who has been interviewed heavily while protesting George Floyd’s police brutality death, was not a usual suspect. She (a black woman) was a police officer coming up for retirement after 19 years on the BPD when she came across a fellow white officer (Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski) beating and choking a detained black man (Neal Mack) in a reported domestic disturbance call.

RELATED: Minneapolis Police Chief Can’t Release George Floyd Bodycam + He’s Fighting with Police Union on Reform

Last week in an interview with WBEN, Horne said of the incident, “You are taught to use only the force necessary to effect an arrest. These officers are going above and beyond because they are beating people who are handcuffed. It was the same situation with Neal Mack. He was handcuffed and being beaten, that’s why I stopped the chokehold.”

After a lengthy two-year investigation, in 2008, Horne was fired just short of being eligible for her pension for violating a suspect’s rights. She apparently jumped on the officer’s back to stop him from choking Mack. Kwiatkowski retaliated by punching her in the face. Horne describes what happened in the below video from 2014.

Horne reflects on what is happening today with the recent protests that are about ongoing police brutality and social injustices.

“Black people scream about it all day every day and you have white people who are sympathetic to our calling to say yea all lives matter but black lives are the ones being brutalized right now so we need attention on black lives,” Horne told Spectrum News earlier this week. “So, when white people understand that and want to jump in on the movement, it’s like come on.”

Now a truck driver with five children, Horne’s been fighting the good fight. She hopes to pass Cariol’s Law which would protect officers who report fellow officers abuse of suspects and others. She is also hoping that state laws will be changed that protect police discipline records from going public.

“If you are a public servant, your record should not be private, especially when you are dealing with the public,” Horne told WBFO. “So, if you are a police officer and you are dealing with someone, it makes no sense to keep the record private, because you are out in the public. It only makes sense.”

So, what ever happened to the white police officer in Horne’s case? Gregory Kwiatkowski (now retired) was convicted of attacking four young black men during an arrest a few years after his incident with Horne. He was sentenced only to four months in prison plus four months of home confinement. The sentence could have carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

But when Democrats commit real racist sins, Hollywood’s pretenders to their best impersonation of crickets.

First, Gov. Ralph “Infanticide” Northam was embroiled in scandal when a photo from his 1984 medical school yearbook surfaced. The picture featured someone in blackface smiling and holding what appears to be a beer standing next to someone else in a KKK hood and robe. Northam went on to claim, incredulously, that he ‘doesn’t believe’ either of the people in the photo is him, though the picture appeared on his personal page and students got to select the pictures for their page.

Then, no doubt fearing that he would be exposed next, Virginia’s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, issued a statement earlier this week ‘admitting’ that he donned blackface and a wig in 1980 to look like a black rapper at a party when he was a 19-year-old undergraduate at the University of Virginia.

While Democratic presidential contenders including Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Rep. Julian Castro of Texas have come out with perfunctory condemnations of both men along with calls for them to resign, there hasn’t been a major outcry from the dishonest “mainstream media” (MSM) or Kimmel and Fallon, though they both donned blackface as part of comedy skits in the past. (Related: Is Trump-hating “Empire” star Jussie Smollett about to be charged with lying to police about his alleged attack by “MAGA country” assailants?)

Kimmel donned blackface to mock NBA player Karl “The Mailman” Malone, who played 18 seasons with the Utah Jazz.

Meanwhile, Fallon once donned blackface and other African American characteristics to imitate and mock comedian Chris Rock.

The hypocrisy is thick on the Hollywood Left

As Breitbart News reported:

Indeed, though both Kimmel and Fallon are now subservient to the politically correct nature of Hollywood, there was a time where both reveled in some politically incorrect humor — Kimmel especially.

On The Man Show, Kimmel and his co-host Adam Carolla did a number of non-PC skits. In one, they poke fun at Asians for a “limited grasp of English” and call their home countries “hellholes.”

Meanwhile, Fox News noted further:

Kimmel wore blackface on numerous occasions, impersonating NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone as well as former daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey in his Comedy Central series “The Man Show.”

Other late night hosts poked fun at Northam but otherwise gave him a pass. “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, who is black and from South Africa, called the Democratic governor a “legend” for claiming to be certain he wasn’t in the yearbook photo because he did blackface at another time. He also called him a “blackface connoisseur” for being an expert in knowing how hard it is to get shoe polish off your face.

Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert praised Northam because he “finally had a chance” to sit down and look at his med school yearbook, adding, “I’m guessing that wearing blackface is one of those things you would remember doing, like skydiving or your first time.”

The hypocrisy is thick, however. Kimmel called POTUS Donald Trump “racist” during his opening monologue for the Oscars in 2017, just a month after he was inaugurated. Also, Kimmel has mocked black music superstar Kanye West over his praise of the president.

When the Left is racist, it’s something to forget about; when a Republican might have, could have, maybe said something racially insensitive, it’s time to go to war with the Right.

Jussie Smollett strikes emotional chord: Attackers won't win

By ANDREW DALTON, AP Entertainment Writer

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP)—Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win.

""The most important thing I can say is `thank you so much, and I'm OK,'' said the ""Empire'' actor and R&B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.

""I'm not fully healed yet,'' said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, ""but I'm going to be, and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all.''

The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it.

But Smollett said he couldn't do that.

""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I couldn't let those (expletives) win,'' he said to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. ""I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.''

His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air.

Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things.

He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.

""And above all, I fought the (expletive) back,'' he said to cheers.

Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh, ""I'm the gay Tupac.''

Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she's glad he did.

""It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,'' Davis said. ""He showed everyone in the room he was strong.''

Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck.

No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck.

Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been ""consistent on every level'' with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators.

Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he's not being genuine.

Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P. Henson in ""Empire,'' the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.

Last year he released a solo album, ""Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night's set, along with songs from ""Empire.''

He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John.

He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore.

Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on.

""To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,'' Joel Smollett Jr. said. ""But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie's healing. He's been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.''

Hashtag stirs debate over role of Christian schools in US

By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer

NEW YORK (AP)—For their supporters, the thousands of Christian schools across America are literally a blessing—a place where children can learn in accordance with biblical teachings, untainted by the secular norms of public schools.

To critics, many of these Christian schools venture too often into indoctrination, with teachings that can misrepresent science and history and potentially breed intolerance toward people with different outlooks.

""These schools are front and center in the politicization of knowledge and that's problematic,'' said Julie Ingersoll, a professor of religious studies at the University of North Florida.

The polarized views have been highlighted in recent days after the appearance of an (hash)ExposeChristianSchools hashtag on Twitter. It was introduced by Chris Stroop, an Indianapolis-based writer and activist, on Jan. 18, shortly after news broke that Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, would be teaching at a Christian school in northern Virginia that lists ""homosexual or lesbian sexual activity'' as among the disqualifying criteria for prospective employees.

Stroop, 38, calls himself an ""ex-evangelical.'' He says he attended Christian schools in Indiana and Colorado almost continuously from first grade through high school and recalls pervasive messaging that demeaned LGBT people and discouraged the empowerment of women.

""Not everything about it was bad—I had teachers I liked who encouraged me academically,'' said Stroop, who went on to earn a Ph.D. at Stanford. ""But I don't think education as indoctrination is right.''

The news about Karen Pence's teaching job was quickly followed by debate over the behavior of boys from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky during a visit to Washington, D.C. While opinions varied widely as to whether the boys had behaved badly, that incident further fueled debate over faith-based schools.

Within days, there were thousands of responses to #ExposeChristianSchools on Twitter, including many personal stories of bad experiences by people who attended them.

One man said his school required students to sign an agreement promising not to listen to ""worldly'' music. Others faulted their curriculum, such as a Christian biology textbook that cited Scotland's fabled Loch Ness Monster as evidence of flaws in Darwin's theory of evolution.

Even as the critiques multiplied, many people took to Twitter to defend Christian schools. Among them was Greg Lukianoff, an attorney active in promoting freedom of speech on college campuses. He said he was an ""outspoken atheist'' beginning in the seventh grade and frequently skipped school.

""Only as an adult did I realize how kind & tolerant my Catholic high school was towards me,'' he tweeted.

In a telephone interview Friday, Lukianoff said he had forged close friendships with people from religious and secular schools, and felt it was unproductive to generalize about them.

Even Brian Toale, a 65-year-old New Yorker who says he was repeatedly sexually abused in the early 1970s by a staffer at his Catholic high school on Long Island, recalls many positive aspects of his school years.

""The education itself was top notch,'' he said. ""I did have several extracurricular activities where I learned stuff and made friends I still have today.''

But Toale, who eventually converted to Judaism, says the school administration failed to properly vet the person who abused him, and later treated him with disdain when he reported the abuse.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 5.9 million students—a tenth of the national prekindergarten through 12th grade total—attend private schools in the U.S. About three-quarters of them attend one of the roughly 22,000 Christian schools.

By far, the Catholic Church accounts for the biggest share of this group, operating more than 6,300 schools serving more than 1.8 million students—about 20 percent of them non-Catholics. The totals are down sharply from the early 1960s when there were more than 5.2 million students in almost 13,000 Catholic schools nationwide.

The Council for American Private Education identifies 4,154 schools as ""conservative Christian,'' serving about 664,000 students.

Julie Ingersoll, the religious studies professor, says those schools are faring well, at least in the eyes of their supporters. She notes that many are now able to access publicly funded tax credits and vouchers in various states, and often can operate with limited regulation.

""But this leaves kids vulnerable on all kinds of levels, which of course was what the hashtag was about,'' Ingersoll said in an email. ""It's been portrayed as a campaign against Christianity from `the left,' but it was really a group of young adults who grew up in Christian schools (and Christian homeschooling) explaining how they believe they were personally harmed by it.''

""These harms were often related to sex, gender, shame, and abuse,'' she wrote. ""But stories also detailed impoverished education, especially when it came to science and history.''

The Rev. Russell Moore, a high-profile official with the Southern Baptist Convention, said the recent criticisms of Christian schools reflect some broader societal trends that have riled conservative religious leaders.

""There's a certain mindset in America that sees any religious conviction as authoritarian,'' Moore said.

Overall, Christian schooling ""is in a very good place,'' Moore said. ""There are some phenomenal evangelical schools, preparing their children with remarkable academic rigor.''

John Gehring, Catholic program director at a Washington-based clergy network called Faith in Public Life, graduated from an all-male Catholic prep school near Baltimore. He has suggested in recent articles that such schools—while admirable in many ways—could do a better job of teaching their students about the church's historical role in exploitation and oppression.

""I'm frustrated by the overheated commentary where Christian and public schools are almost viewed as enemy combatants in the culture wars,'' Gehring said. ""Each has their place, and like any institution they have strengths and weaknesses. The Catholic schools I attended through college shaped my understanding of justice and cultivated a spirituality that frames my life, even if those environments could sometimes be a little cloistered and privileged.''

Arkansas court rules city can't enforce LGBT protections

By ANDREW DeMILLO, Associated Press

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)—Arkansas' highest court on Thursday said a city can't enforce its ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, saying it's already ruled the measure violates a state law aimed at preventing local protections for LGBT people.

The state Supreme Court unanimously reversed a Washington County judge's decision to allow Fayetteville to continue enforcing its anti-discrimination ordinance while the city challenged the constitutionality of a 2015 law preventing cities and counties from enacting protections not covered by state law. Arkansas' civil rights law doesn't cover sexual orientation or gender identity.

The court in 2017 ruled the ordinance violated the state law. Citing that decision, justices on Thursday reversed Judge Doug Martin's ruling and dismissed the case. In Thursday's ruling and the previous decision, the court did not rule on whether the state law was constitutional.

""Because the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction on remand, its actions following remand are void,'' Justice Robin Wynne wrote. ""The order denying the preliminary injunction is reversed, and, because the sole issue over which the circuit court properly had jurisdiction was conclusively decided by this court in our 2017 opinion, the matter is dismissed in its entirety.''

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have non-discrimination laws based on sexual orientation and gender identity covering employment, housing, public accommodations, credit and insurance, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Fayetteville, the home of the University of Arkansas' flagship campus and a gay pride parade that organizers tout as the largest in the state, is considered a liberal enclave in a conservative region of the state. It's one of several cities that approved local protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in response to the 2015 state law. The court in 2017 rejected the city's argument that it was allowed because LGBT protections are included in other parts of state law.

""Today's unanimous decisions reaffirm the state's authority to ensure uniformity of anti-discrimination laws statewide and to prevent businesses from facing a patchwork of nondiscrimination ordinances,'' Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican who had argued against the ordinance, said in a statement. ""These decisions show that the city of Fayetteville is not above or immune from State law.''

Fayetteville City Attorney Kit Williams said he would likely ask the court to reconsider its decision and said the city's argument that the law is unconstitutional remains undecided.

""The city has never had an attempt to defend a citizen-passed ordinance by showing that the state law was an unequal protection of the laws,'' Williams said. ""It seems very strange that they would deny us the right to at least present that constitutional argument to them for their decision.''

In a related case, justices said Martin incorrectly ruled that Arkansas' constitution only protects lawmakers from testifying about what they say on the General Assembly floor or in committees but did not say how far that protection went. Martin had ordered sponsors of Arkansas' law on local LGBT protections to testify and produce documents in the lawsuit.

He currently shares his experiences as a motivational speaker.

Judge stops parts of Tampa's 'conversion therapy' ban

TAMPA, Fla. (AP)—A federal magistrate is stopping the enforcement of a portion of Tampa's ordinance prohibiting same-sex conversion therapy for minors.

The U.S. magistrate judge issued a preliminary injunction on Wednesday.

The injunction stops the city of Tampa from banning conversion therapy involving talking, but it would allow the ban to be applied to techniques like electroshock therapy.

The ordinance was approved in 2017 and challenged by a Christian ministry and therapists who practice conversion therapy. They claimed it violated their free-speech rights.

The challengers asked for a preliminary injunction that would stop the ordinance's enforcement while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. The case now goes to a district judge.

The American Psychological Association opposes therapy seeking to change sexual orientation, saying it doesn't work and can cause harm.

The stars of Empire are reportedly still subject to extra security measures in the investigation of Jussie Smollett’s attack last week.

According to TMZ, post on the Chicago set is being intercepted by a private security company brought in by the FBI to prevent dangerous content reaching the cast.

The report suggests that screeners are instructed to ‘flag any threatening mail’ and alert the FBI, as well as trying to make links with a letter addressed to Jussie the week before he was attacked by two masked men.

An anonymous handwritten letter arrived on the TV show set allegedly containing racist and homophobic slurs just days before the incident.

However, it’s reported that this is not the first ‘hate mail’ the Fox show has been subject to.

Screeners are made to wear gloves to protect any potential evidence and high alert for anything suspicious.

The police report from the night of the incident, released on Wednesday, suggests that Jussie was initially hesitant to report the attack to police on Tuesday 29 January.

Jussie was allegedly stopped by two attackers, concealed by black clothing and face masks, who their hands to beat him before throwing liquid and putting a rope around his neck.

The actor, best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Empire, spoke to Chicago Police after admitting himself to hospital that night.

Downtown Chicago is full of Trump-loving, ski-masked racists. At least, that’s the assumption made by people who believe the incredulous hate crime tale of Jussie Smollett.

Smollett is a gay black man who stars in the popular black television series Empire. He is also a rapper. Smollett claims he was beaten in the early morning on January 29 in Chicago by two white men in ski masks who recognized him as “that faggot Empire nigger.” His two alleged assailants knocked him down, tied a noose they just happened to have with them around his neck, and then poured an unidentified substance onto him. During the alleged assault, Smollett’s attackers proclaimed that downtown Chicago was “MAGA country.”

That’s a curious thing to say, considering Donald Trump only received 12.5% of Chicago’s vote in 2016 and the city is 31.7% non-Hispanic white. That’s not exactly MAGA country demographics. It’s also unlikely that violent Trump supporters would recognize any cast members from Empire and know important details about them.

This alleged hate crime was readily believed by the mainstream media, and Smollett was lionized as a noble victim.

Unsurprisingly, this story seemed fishy right from the start.

First, it was the contradictory reports that the Chicago Police didn’t know about the “MAGA country” remark. Then came the hunt for video evidence of the attack, which didn’t turn up any footage of the actual assault. The only thing that came from thousands of hours of camera footage on multiple streets that the police reviewed are two suspicious dark shapes walking on the opposite side of the street from Smollett.

Smollett was captured on video for all but sixty seconds. After the sixty seconds where he disappeared into an alley, Smollett reappears with a noose hanging around his neck like a tie. That’s an awfully short amount of time to suffer such a severe attack.

More fishy details have continued to emerge. Smollett’s manager claimed he was on the phone with his client during most of the attack and heard the “MAGA country” remark. That wasn’t initially in the police report, and, most suspiciously of all, Smollett and his manager refused to hand over their phone records to police.

Smollett decided to add another element to his story that reinforced the idea that the whole thing was a fabrication. As he returned to the stage after the supposed attack, Smollett bragged that he “fought the fuck back” against his attackers. That seems impossible considering his story and that he kept a cellphone in his hand throughout the entire assault.

Police provided another odd detail that undermined his account. According to authorities, Smollett was carrying and managed to protect a Subway sandwich throughout the brutal attack, and emerged with the undamaged sub in his hand when he reappeared on the surveillance footage.

To summarize:

Smollett was brutally beaten in less than sixty seconds in a diverse, anti-Trump city. His violent, racist attackers knew he starred in a show that is not generally watched by people likely to be Trump supporters, or who would know his sexual orientation. They also somehow believe that their diverse, anti-Trump city is MAGA country. Additionally, in his own words, Smollett fought off his attackers while simultaneously pinned to the ground, talking on his cellphone, and holding onto a Subway sandwich.

Count me as a skeptic.

Police also appear to be skeptical. One local reporter said that his police sourcesthought the whole thing was a hoax. Police are currently requesting the phone records of Smollett and his manager.

Even without the additional details and the changing story from Smollett’s camp, the whole thing seemed unbelievable. America has experienced way too many hate hoaxes recently to fall for such a ridiculous story as this one. And yet we all had to sit through another case of the mainstream media falling for one. Smollett was still able to bask in his noble victimhood, even as his story unravelled. Nearly every outlet faithfully reported his “fought the fuck back” comments without any hint of doubt.

GQ covered his first performance since the alleged assault with this celebratory headline, “Jussie Smollett Is Defiant at His First Performance After a Racist, Homophobic Assault.” There was no “alleged” in the headline, nor any indicators in the article that we should perhaps not absolutely believe Smollett’s story.

Indeed, earlier in the week, GQ had published an article on why everyone should definitely believe that Smollett was a victim of a hate crime: because it confirms the Left-wing narrative on hate in Trump’s America. The writer, Joshua Rivera, was incensed that the alleged crime was being treated as a “possible hate crime” by police rather than as a definite one. Rivera believes these attacks are very common, and argues that “almost all violent extremist crime is committed by right-wing terrorists.” This writer claims that the attack fits into the grand scheme of whiteness: “Whiteness in 21st century America has an endgame, and it is this: to divest itself from the shame of its power, while working to revive the fear it needs in which to thrive.”

Rivera concludes his article with an affirmation of his blind faith that this attack occurred by dismissing the disputed facts of the case:

A still-disputed aspect of the attack on Smollett is a line shouted after his attackers fled the scene: “This is MAGA country.” While its veracity isn’t confirmed, its sentiment needs no fact-check. America’s choice to embrace the blind rage of late-stage whiteness in decline is an explicit longing for this kind of crime, a version of America in which those who do not assimilate to the satisfaction of their white, straight, and Christian betters are subject to the impunity of law enforcement, the scorn of the media and the fury of racist homophobes stalking the streets of your city, who want you to know that they could lynch you if they really wanted to, and maybe get away with it too.

Imagine believing that whites easily get away with hate crimes in 2019 America!

Even those writers who accepted that elements of the case didn’t add up still chose to believe that it happened because it aligned with their preferred narrative. Chicago Tribune columnist Dahleen Glanton, who is black, noted that many parts of the story seemed unbelievable, such as Trump supporters rampaging in liberal Chicago at 2 AM in freezing temperatures.

And yet Glanton also urged her readers to believe the case because “[w]hy are we so obsessed with who committed the crime rather than dealing with the fact that such crimes routinely happen across America?” She concluded by saying, “At this point, we should all consider Smollett the victim of a horrible hate crime. And in Chicago, we should stop pretending like horrible things like this could never happen in our city.”

The belief that angry white men are the primary threat to non-whites in Chicago cannot be challenged by common sense or facts. It must be accepted by all.

Ever since Trump was elected, hate hoaxes have proliferated to an all-time high. There was the Muslim girl on the New York City train who claimed she was assaulted because of her hijab. That was bullshit. There were dozens of threats to Jewish community centers that turned out to be the work of an Israeli teenager and a black journalist.American Renaissance maintains an extensive database of hate hoaxes, many of which resemble the Smollett case. Many non-whites have sought to fabricate crimes against themselves to win fame and attack the white majority.

Smollett is a vocal Trump critic who made an entire music video showing his disdain for the President. He also has a career that would benefit immensely from suffering a “homophobic” and “racist” hate crime. He knows what kind of message to send to get the Left and the media on his side, as he concluded his most recent performance with, “Be as black, be as brown, be as gay as the fuck you want to be!” Be anything that sets you apart from the evil, Trump-supporting crowd.

Hate hoaxes meet the Left’s demand for victimhood. Leftists need to believe that Trump’s America is full of violent racists who will attack non-whites at a moment’s notice. If this is widely believed, it makes it easier to call for laws criminalizing hate speech and greater law enforcement attention to “hate groups.” This false notion also satisfies the Left’s persecution mania. Even though Leftists and their sympathizers control nearly every institution in our society and can speak as freely as they want, they still consider themselves to be suffering under an oppressive, white supremacist regime.

Since there are not enough real hate crimes to satisfy this mania, media outlets continue to readily accept any that are staged for them. The Southern Poverty Law Center and others tell them that hate crimes are skyrocketing, so why should they doubt that emboldened white racists would travel to Chicago to attack Jussie Smollett?

It is true that Chicago has witnessed disturbing hate crimes in recent years – against white people. In late 2016, there was the white motorist who was pulled out of his car and beaten by black youths because he looked like a Trump supporter. In January 2017, there was the mentally handicapped white man who was kidnapped and torturedby blacks because of his race. Those cases were largely ignored by the media outlets currently hyperventilating over Smollett’s tall tale. CNN commentator Symone Sanders mocked the motorist’s beating at the time with the statement, “Oh my goodness, poor white people!”

Hate crimes against whites are rising in the Trump age, yet they still receive scant attention from the mainstream media. Both of those anti-white assaults in Chicago were caught on camera and were undisputedly motivated by hate. They didn’t conform to the preferred narrative, however, so they were ignored.

When Smollett’s story turns out to be a fantasy, we won’t see any mea culpas from the folks who promoted it or any improvement in the coverage of such bogus claims. It’s just too advantageous to propagate hoaxes for their cause."
