R Kelly’s bail has been set at $1 million following his arrest on sex abuse charges, according to Mirror.co.uk reports.

The singer, real name Robert Kelly, 52, appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star’s bail at $1 million.

It was the same judge who oversaw Jussie Smollett’s bond hearing earlier this week when the actor – accused of filing a false police report – was released on £76,693 bail.

He faced the court wearing a black hoodie and kept his hands behind his back throughout the hearing.

The singer is described as showing “very little emotion” and kept his eyes fixed on the floor for the majority of his time in court.

The judge described the allegations against Kelly as “disturbing” and ordered him not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.

Kelly’s attorney reportedly argued that the star is currently broke due to a number of financial setbacks.

Attorney Steven Greenberg is said to have told the judge Kelly has a child support judgement against him that he’s unable to pay and he’s not making any money.

Greenberg claimed Kelly’s earning very little from his music and is not touring.

He also said his client was not a flight risk, telling the judge: “Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn’t like to fly.”

He was referring to Kelly’s huge hit single I Believe I Can Fly.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

Kelly’s hearing came a day after he handed himself in to police to face 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The Grammy-winning R&B star, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls for decades.

He has denied any wrongdoing.

R Kelly handed himself in to the authorities after being charged with aggravated sexual abuse against four alleged victims.

The singer left his apartment surrounded by members of his entourage and flanked by security guards.

He was driven to the station in a dark-coloured van with heavily-tinted rear windows.

The vehicle pulled up outside the precinct about 8.15pm and a security detail for Kelly kept reporters and cameramen at arms’ length as he exited the side door.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a short time later that R Kelly was under arrest.

R Kelly had previously said he was “shell-shocked” by the charges and was looking forward to clearing his name in court.

The 52-year-old star was charged in a 10-count Cook County Circuit Court indictment handed down two months after the debut of a six-hour documentary series on the Lifetime television network in which multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct and abuse."

Williams was sent to the campus by Turning Point USA to help recruit potential conservative leaders. Campus police were called to Sproul Plaza after being informed of a disturbance, where they found Williams injured. However, the alleged suspect was no where to be found. Law enforcement is investigating the situation and has identified a suspect, but has not released his name, according to CNN News.

Williams is seen in video footage wearing a Turning Point USA T-shirt. The remains of his informative display are strewn across the ground in shambles. Police say that two men approached Williams and they engaged in a verbal altercation. The victim attempted to record the exchange on his phone, but one of the men “slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand.” He then allegedly flipped over the table Williams had been using and punched him in the face several times. Video evidence depicts the suspect grabbing Williams by his jacket and striking him repeatedly, knocking his hat off. The suspect is heard yelling profanities and slurs and calls Williams a “racist.”

A conservative student on UC Berkeley's campus was punched in the face on Tuesday. The victim was advertising for the conservative group Turning Point USA on Cal's Sproul Plaza, at the time of the assault. https://t.co/URRTHOUCiM — San Francisco Chronicle (@sfchronicle) February 22, 2019

Williams told Fox News host Sean Hannity that the men became angry with him because of a sign that was a part of his display. The sign read, “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims.” It was said to be a reference to Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of staging his own hate crime.

“This person claimed we were promoting violence on campus and proceeded to take his aggression out on us,” Williams told Hannity.

At this time, Smollett continues to proclaim his evidence and insists that he was the victim in the situation. On Thursday, he was formally charged with a felony for filing a false police report.

Arda Erbil was present on the plaza at the time of the attack and decided to record the altercation for evidence.

“Seeing something like that happen in such an open place was disheartening,” he said.

UC Berkeley released a public statement on Thursday regarding the attack. They called the assault “reprehensible” and condemned such acts of violence. The campus is intended to be a place where all can express their views without fear of this form of retaliation."

Now that it’s been confirmed that Jussie Smollett’s lied his ass off about being attacked by Trump supporters, we knew it wouldn’t be long before comedians started parodying the whole situation. And first up is The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.

The Daily Show, which airs weeknights on Comedy Central, put together a fake Lifetime-esque movie trailer mocking Jussie’s “attack” and how it came to be, starring look-a-like Jaboukie Young-White as Smollett.

.@jaboukie has some thoughts on Jussie Smollett: pic.twitter.com/0CJdKHjz6I — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) February 20, 2019

The hilarious trailer takes viewers through every stage of Smollett’s staged attack, from him being insulted after he was given $60,000 for working “three days this week” to not being taken seriously after creating a fake death-threat letter that says “I’m going to kill me,” to plotting out the hoax with his Nigerian trainer friends, and eventually clumsily carrying the fake attack out.

The trailer even features a dramatic shot of a Subway sandwich falling to the ground. And in the end, Jussie (Jaboukie) holds a rope as he looks into the camera and says “I’m the gay Tupac.” Pure hilarity all around, tbh.

Jussie Smollett was arrested Thursday and charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was released on $100,000 bond and faces up to three years in jail if convicted. He still maintains his innocence."

The “Empire” actor was arrested on Thursday (Feb. 21) after being accused of concocting a story that he was beaten by two white men in Chicago, who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. He was released on the same day of his arrest after a posting a $100,000 bond. He’s officially charged with felony disorderly conductfor filing a false police report.

Shortly before the arrest, it was revealed that in 2007 Smollett received a misdemeanor charge in Los Angeles after he was stopped for a suspected DUI and lied to an officer about who he was. Smollett said that he was his brother Jake Smollett and didn’t sign his real name on a document that said he would promise to appear in court.

Smollett then pleaded no contest to the charge of giving false information and did the same with the charges of driving without a valid driver’s license and the DUI. According to NBC Philadelphia, the actor received two years of probation that year, paid a fine and had to attend an alcohol treatment program.

On Thursday (Feb. 21), Smollett’s legal team issued a statement about the recent disorderly conduct charge and said his arrest is a huge injustice. Jake Smollett then posted that statement on his Instagram page later that day.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” the statement read. “Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently want to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

One of Jake Smollett’s followers responded to that post, which caught his attention.

“Your brother lied and said he was you when he got stopped for a DUI in 2007,” that person wrote. “So much for impeccable character. Give it up lol.”

Jake Smollett eventually shot back.

“F–k U,” he responded. He also disabled the comments on his Instagram page afterward.

According to CNN, Smollett apologized to his “Empire” cast mates for any negative attention he brought their way, and he still maintains his innocence."

Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember: In October 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car — after a childbirth class no less — and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife.

The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside.

She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.

But, while a lot was said about why Smith did it — the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma — little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to, allegedly, flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts, or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay.

As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events. But they should try. On the very same day Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors revealed that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target.

Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder, and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story, just the latest, and probably won't be the last.

Can I Just Tell You: The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be, the truth can hurt but the truth WILL come out eventually and it will always set you free. But for that to happen there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers.

In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts. The cases of Smollett and the accused Coast Guard officer Christopher Hasson, continue to unfold.

But whatever uncomfortable facts emerge — about how far some will go for attention or about white supremacist leanings among those sworn to protect and defend us — about alcohol, drugs, or perhaps unresolved childhood trauma — we have to be prepared to face those facts.

We have to because the world is complicated. We have to because, as Maya Angelou said, hurt people will hurt people. We have to because our lives depend on it. We have to because we are, after all, brave. And we can handle the truth.

On the very same day Smollett, who was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors reveal that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target. Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And, as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story - just the latest and probably not the last.

Can I just tell you? The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be. The truth can hurt, but the truth will come out eventually, and it will always set you free. But for that to happen, there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers. In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts.

The cases of Smollett and the accused Coast Guard officer, Christopher Hasson, continue to unfold. But whatever uncomfortable facts emerge about how far some will go for attention or about white supremacist leanings among those sworn to protect and defend us, about alcohol, drugs or perhaps unresolved childhood trauma, we have to be prepared to face those facts. We have to because the world is complicated. We have to because, as Maya Angelou said, hurt people will hurt people. We have to because our lives depend on it. We have to because we are, after all, brave. And we can handle the truth. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."

Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember: In October 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car — after a childbirth class no less — and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife.

The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside.

She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.

But, while a lot was said about why Smith did it — the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma — little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to, allegedly, flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts, or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay.

As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events. But they should try.

The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside.

She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.

But, while a lot was said about why Smith did it — the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma — little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to, allegedly, flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts, or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay.

As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events. But they should try. On the very same day Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors revealed that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target.

Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder, and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story, just the latest, and probably won't be the last.

Can I Just Tell You: The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be, the truth can hurt but the truth WILL come out eventually and it will always set you free. But for that to happen there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers.

In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts. The cases of Smollett and the accused Coast Guard officer Christopher Hasson, continue to unfold.

But whatever uncomfortable facts emerge — about how far some will go for attention or about white supremacist leanings among those sworn to protect and defend us — about alcohol, drugs, or perhaps unresolved childhood trauma — we have to be prepared to face those facts.

We have to because the world is complicated. We have to because, as Maya Angelou said, hurt people will hurt people. We have to because our lives depend on it. We have to because we are, after all, brave. And we can handle the truth.

Kelly's bond set at $1 million following aggravated sexual abuse charges

A judge set R. Kelly's bond at $1 million dollars on Saturday afternoon, following the R&B singer's Friday arrest on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

According to an indictment filed Friday in Cook County, Illinois, the crimes took place between 1998 and 2010 and involved four victims, three of whom were between 13 and 16 years old. One of the alleged victims was an adult.

Each count carries a possible sentence of three to seven years in prison.

Jason Meisner, a Chicago Tribune reporter who attended the hearing, tweeted that Kelly would have to pay $100,000, or 10 percent of the $1 million, to be released on bond. Judge John Lyke Jr. also ordered Kelly to turn in his passport and barred him from contacting anyone under the age of 18, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The charges follow decades of sexual misconduct accusations, often involving minors, against the 52-year-old R&B singer. On Friday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced the charges at a news conference. Kelly turned himself in to Chicago police that evening.

Foxx made a public plea for any victims to come forward in January, following the airing of Lifetime's documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly."" The six-part series closely examined the allegations against Kelly and helped to spark a new round of interest in them.

""There is nothing to be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses,"" Foxx said in a news conference on Jan. 9. ""We cannot seek justice without you.""

Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg told reporters Friday that his client, who has long denied any allegations against him, was innocent. ""I think all the women are lying,"" Greenberg said outside Kelly's studio on Friday, according to CBS Chicago.

The indictment filed Friday detail offenses committed against four individuals. The oldest allegations date to between May 1998 and May 1999, when Kelly was at least 31 and the alleged victim was under 17. The most recent allegations detailed in the indictment involve another minor and took place between May 2009 and January 2010, according to the charging documents.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who announced last week that he had given authorities a VHS tape that allegedly shows Kelly engaging in sexual activity with a minor, said in a news conference Friday evening that he represents two of Kelly's alleged victims, one of whom was included in the indictment.

Kelly was charged with child pornography in 2002 after a graphic videotape was sent to Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jim DeRogatis. Kelly was acquitted of those charges years later, in 2008. Kelly has also settled numerous lawsuits with women who have accused him of coercing them into sexual relationships while underage. In 1994, Kelly, 27, illegally married the singer Aaliyah, who was 15. To evade the fact that the underage performer would need parental permission to get married, Kelly's tour manager took her to get a fake ID.

Kelly's music career continued thriving even after the child pornography case. RCA Records, a subsidiary of Sony, kept him on their label until January. Major artists have collaborated with Kelly in recent years, including Chance the Rapper and Lady Gaga, who recorded duets with Kelly in 2015 and 2013, respectively. Both have since apologized for doing so.

The allegations against Kelly began receiving renewed scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement. BuzzFeed published a lengthy investigation by DeRogatis based on the experiences of four former members of Kelly's inner circle. The article accused Kelly of running an ""abusive cult."" In a May statement to The Post, Kelly's management said that the singer ""has close friendships with a number of women who are strong, independent, happy, well cared for and free to come and go as they please.""

Lyke, who presided over Kelly's bond hearing, is the same judge who on Thursday set 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett's bond at $100,000. Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

This was Kelly's first court appearance since his arrest on Friday. As of Friday, his arraignment is scheduled for March 8.

CHICAGO (AP) - The Latest on the sexual abuse case against R&B singer R. Kelly (all times local):



3 p.m.



Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it is ""outrageous"" that R. Kelly's attorney asserts that the four accusers are lying about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.



Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, ""We're going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.""



He was referring to Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.



Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million that Kelly ""is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""



Referring to the #MeToo movement, Greenberg said, ""Unfortunately, there's this whole hashtag movement. Just because someone says something now ... it doesn't make them credible.""



___



2 p.m.



R. Kelly's lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""



Greenberg made the comments Saturday after a judge set a $1 million bond for Kelly, who was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four females, including three who were underage at the time.



Greenberg says he's happy with the bond amount, but Kelly doesn't have much money because he says mismanagement by others put the singer in financial straits.



He says Kelly is trying to get the bond money together and hopes to get out of jail later Saturday.



___



1:40 p.m.



The lawyer for R. Kelly says he thinks the four people the R&B singer is charged with sexually abusing are all lying.



Steve Greenberg made the comment to reporters Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million.



Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

A prosecutor told the judge at R. Kelly's bond hearing in Chicago that the singer met one of the four people he's charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial.



The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.



Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.



The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.



Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

1:10 p.m.



A judge has set R&B singer R. Kelly's bond at $1 million.



Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. said during Saturday's hearing in Chicago that the amount equals $250,000 for each of the four people he's charged with sexually abusing.



Lyke called the allegations against Kelly ""disturbing"" during the hearing. The singer stared at the floor while the judge was speaking and looked dejected.

12:50 p.m.



R. Kelly has arrived at a Chicago court hearing where a judge will decide bond in the sexual abuse case against the R&B singer.



The judge at Saturday's hearing, Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., is the same judge who presided over ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week.



Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

12:05 a.m.



R&B singer R. Kelly is expected to appear in a Chicago court one day after being arrested and charged with aggravated sexual abuse.



Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced 10 counts Friday against the Grammy winner. She said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade. The charges involved four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17.



Chicago police say Kelly was taken into custody after the 52-year-old singer surrendered Friday night. He was scheduled to be arraigned Saturday.



Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct, but he has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

HBO's Maher blamed Bezos for pitting wealthy cities against one another in a real estate battle over where the next Amazon headquarters would be built, while ignoring states that he argued would benefit most from thousands of new jobs. This, after a previous deal to build in New York City fell through.

BILL MAHER ON JUSSIE SMOLLETT: VICTIMS SHOULDN’T ALWAYS BE BELIEVED, THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN ‘SERIOUSLY’

“We have a problem in America called spatial geographic inequality which means the most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities,” he said.

He said there are “two Americas,” referencing states that historically vote Democratic versus ones that skew Republican.

“We have orchestras and theaters districts and world-class shopping. We have Chef Wolfgang Puck, they have Chef Boyardee.”

He continued: “The blue parts of America are having a big prosperity party while the big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail -- and they still use the mail.”

The comedian went on to explain why he thinks red-state voters are so “pissed off.”

“The fly-over states have become the passed-over states, that’s why red state voters are so pissed off. They don’t hate us, they want to be us.”"

Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember: In October 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car — after a childbirth class no less — and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife.

The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside.

She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.

But, while a lot was said about why Smith did it — the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma — little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to, allegedly, flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts, or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay.

As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events. But they should try. On the very same day Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors revealed that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target.

Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder, and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story, just the latest, and probably won't be the last.

Can I Just Tell You: The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be, the truth can hurt but the truth WILL come out eventually and it will always set you free. But for that to happen there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers.

Finally today, I have two names for those tempted to gloat, despair or be ashamed because of Jussie Smollett, the actor now accused of orchestrating a fake bias crime against himself. Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember, in October, 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car - after a childbirth class, no less - and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife. The governor and the mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods. Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup. It was a national story highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year.

Except there was no robbery. There was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing. It was never clear why. But when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later, October, 1994 in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up then drove to a lake, where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside. She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth. Authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off.

Smith was convicted and remains in prison. But while a lot was said about why Smith did it, the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma. Little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to allegedly flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat-wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay. As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitter-verse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events.

But they should try. On the very same day Smollett, who was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors reveal that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target. Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And, as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story - just the latest and probably not the last.

Can I just tell you? The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be. The truth can hurt, but the truth will come out eventually, and it will always set you free. But for that to happen, there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers. In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts.

Yet even a win for the unions wouldn’t have meant much in the long run.

Body-camera footage, the Appellate Division-First Department ruled, is not “a personnel record covered by the confidentiality and disclosure requirements” of state law or labor contracts.

The unions’ claim was dubious from the start: Body-cams, after all, record what public employees (police) are doing in public. The idea that they’re somehow exclusively or even predominantly a part of a personnel record is just silly.

It’s certainly true that video doesn’t always give the full story. For starters, it can’t show what’s happening just off-screen, nor provide context for actions that don’t immediately make sense to non-expert viewers.

But it does, on balance, add hugely to the available information about any incident that proves controversial — and so benefits officers falsely accused of wrongdoing.

In other words, body cams are a deterrent both to cops who might otherwise be tempted to cross the line and to perps eager to make false claims in pursuit of get-out-of-jail-free cards. Indeed, by preventing frivolous brutality suits, they could easily wind up a huge money-saver for the public.

Overall, research shows that body cams lead to fewer complaints against police — down by 93 percent in a recent University of Cambridge study.

An earlier study on body cams in Rialto, Calif. (one of the first adopters of the tech), showed that it brought officer use of force down 59 percent and civilian complaints down 87 percent.

Some fear that being constantly on camera might leave police too risk-averse, afraid they’ll be disciplined for legitimate actions that just don’t “look good.” Thing is, the proliferation of cameras (and not just on smartphones) makes it ever more likely that part of an officer’s actions will be recorded: Body cams at least ensure that the record will be as complete as possible.

Which, of course, is a big plus for a force as high-quality as the NYPD. As Police Commissioner James O’Neill noted in support of the court ruling, this “footage overwhelmingly shows just how brave, skilled and dedicated our cops are every single day in the service of the people of New York City.”

Yes, body cams are a big problem for bad cops: Ex-Commissioner Ray Kelly switched from opposing to supporting them after seeing video of a South Carolina cop shooting a fleeing unarmed man in the back.

But cameras also mean trouble for bad civilians: Chicago police used video from a host of sources to crack the Jussie Smollett case.

Guarding against misuse may require some system for review of body-cam footage before it’s made public, but maximum transparency is in the interest of all law-abiding civilians and police."

Following Smollett's ouster, producers on the series are reportedly considering a recast of Jamal should Empire return for a sixth season. An Empire source told TVLine that the show's co-creator Lee Daniels, who loosely based Jamal's character on himself, could be ""a strong proponent of the recast option.""

According to TMZ, some of the show's cast members believe Smollett's decision to allegedly orchestrate a hate crime against himself, may have been considered after Lee Daniels' cousin fell victim to a homophobic assault in January. The Empire producer took to Instagram to condemn the hate crime and urge that these attacks become a thing of the past.

On Friday, Empire executives—Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer, announced that Smollett would not be returning for the remainder of season five in light of the ""disturbing"" nature of the accusations against him.

""We are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,"" the statement read. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.""

The statement released suggests the producers have yet to decide whether the actor's exit will be permanent. However, that decision is also contingent on whether the Fox drama is renewed for another season."

Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember: In October 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car — after a childbirth class no less — and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife.

The governor and mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods; Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup.

It was a national story, highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year. Except, there was no robbery, there was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing — it was never clear why — but when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later — October 1994 — in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up, and then drove to a lake where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside.

She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets, claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth; authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off. Smith was convicted and remains in prison.

But, while a lot was said about why Smith did it — the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma — little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to, allegedly, flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts, or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay.

As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitterverse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events. But they should try. On the very same day Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors revealed that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target.

Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder, and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story, just the latest, and probably won't be the last.

Can I Just Tell You: The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be, the truth can hurt but the truth WILL come out eventually and it will always set you free. But for that to happen there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers.

In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts. The cases of Smollett and the accused Coast Guard officer Christopher Hasson, continue to unfold.

But whatever uncomfortable facts emerge — about how far some will go for attention or about white supremacist leanings among those sworn to protect and defend us — about alcohol, drugs, or perhaps unresolved childhood trauma — we have to be prepared to face those facts.

We have to because the world is complicated. We have to because, as Maya Angelou said, hurt people will hurt people. We have to because our lives depend on it. We have to because we are, after all, brave. And we can handle the truth.

Producers release statement in wake of new case details",['Shaunee Flowers'],https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Is-Jamal-leaving-Empire.jpg,"['jamal', 'fired', 'statement', 'written', 'wake', 'attack', 'season', 'release', 'cast', 'episodes', 'final', 'jussie', 'smollett', 'leaving', 'empire', 'producers']","The investigation into an alleged attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett took a shocking turn over the past week when Chicago investigators named him a suspect and suggested the reason behind staging attack was due to his displeasure over Empire pay.

On Friday, Empire producers announced that Jussie Smollett would not be appearing in the final two episodes of Season 5. This information was shared just one day after Smollett was arrested in Chicago for allegedly staging the attack. Smollett still denies that he was involved in planning or orchestrating the 2 a.m. attack on January 29.

Jussie Smollett returns to Empire set

On Thursday, after Jussie Smollett was arrested by Chicago police and then released, he reportedly headed straight for the Empire set. This is likely why so many questioned whether or not Jamal was leaving Empire or if Jussie Smollett would be allowed to continue playing his most famous role.

Read More Jussie Smollett has been indicted again over alleged hoax racist and homophobic attack

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” Empire producers said in a statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

We will see more of Jussie Smollett’s character Jamal before Season 5 of Empire ends

Initially, reports indicated that Jussie Smollett’s role on Empire would be reduced for the remainder of Season 5. As more and more evidence mounted against him. it was made clear that the part of Jamal would be rewritten from being the main focus of certain scenes to being a background player.

Now it has been made clear that Smollett won’t be filming the final two episodes at all but we will still see him before Season 5 ends.

There were 18 episodes ordered for Season 5 of Empire and prior to the midseason break in December 2018, only nine of those episodes have aired. So while Jussie’s character has been written out for the final two episodes, which still need to be filmed, we can expect to see him, at least briefly, in the next seven episodes when the FOX hit returns at the end of March.

Will Jamal be written out of Empire or will Jussie Smollett be allowed to return?

Whether Jussie Smollett will be able to return beyond Season 5 of Empire is still up in the air. In the statement released by Empire producers, they were very clear that Jussie was written out of the final two episodes in order to lessen disruptions caused by his ongoing case. They did not say he would be written off the show entirely.

At this point, there are many factors that could determine Jussie Smollett’s fate as part of the Empire cast. For starters, he hasn’t been convicted of any crime yet but if he is, Smollett could be facing jail time which would put an end to his run on the FOX series.

There is also the rest of the Empire cast to take into consideration. Jussie has reportedly apologized to the cast and crew but continued to maintain his innocence. Meanwhile, there are reports that the cast is split over whether he should ever be allowed to return."

If his name was Fufai Pun, Kheong Ng-Thang or Tsz Mat Pun, Smollet would’ve received a mere fraction of the coverage he did during his whole ordeal.

And then maybe, if he concocted it all, it wouldn’t have been worth it.

A mere fraction of the Smollett news coverage is all the three aforementioned Asian immigrants got for being hammered to death by 34-year-old Arthur Martunovich, an immigrant from Estonia, at the Seaport Buffet in Brooklyn on Jan. 15.

If you never heard the story, don’t worry, most people haven’t.

It wasn’t even considered a hate crime at first.

There was no snap judgment. Police just were meticulous and had to think about.

There was some coverage in the New York tabloids, but consider that in the media capital of the world, three Asian-American immigrants are hammered to death by a white immigrant in a mini-massacre and people around the world, let alone the New York metro area, aren’t buzzing about it still?

The story just didn’t get the Jussie Smollett treatment.

For starters, Smollett wasn’t Asian.

The secret sauce, of course, was his celebrity. Smollett was the fourth-billed actor on the hit Fox TV series “Empire.”

Maybe Fufai Pun, Kheong Ng-Thang or Tsz Mat Pun would have gotten some attention had they been extras on “Fresh Off the Boat,” or “Dr. Ken” or something?

By now you know, Smollett has been charged with staging the whole thing. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was blunt: “Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Earlier in the day, Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police and was arrested for filing a false police report, a felony that carries a penalty of 1 to 3 years and a $25,000 fine.

He posted a $10,000 bond and then made a perp walk out of custody that looked like an MMA ring entrance.

But soon after, Smollett was off to work on the set of “Empire” in Chicago, as if nothing happened to change anything at all.

Smollett apologized to his cast and crew, and reportedly stuck to his story that he was a victim of an alleged hate crime, and continued to claim innocence.

It was the media and the legal system who was to blame for his situation.

I immediately went to find the “Good Morning America” interview from Feb. 14 with Robin Roberts.

I went back to see how Smollett had most of America seeing him the way he wanted to see himself, as a gay black man, who claimed to have fought back against attackers who he said had a rope around his neck and tried to pour bleach on him. And all while they said to him, “This is MAGA Country.”

When he’s challenged (albeit mildly by Roberts), Smollett said: “It feels like if I had said I was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”

And that’s what struck a nerve.

He did say he was black, didn’t he? Or did he forget? Or was he just gay and his attackers were homophobes and not racist?

There was plenty to be skeptical about. But in the third and final segment of his interview, Smollett managed some tears around 4 minutes in to attempt to make his case.

Does he deserve an Oscar for that?

Or our disdain?

Early Friday, Fox made a decision to drop Smollett from the last two episodes of the season. In a statement, executive producers said they were “placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

And now we’ll see.

I’ll continue to reserve judgment on Smollett.

But Smollett surely touched all the hot buttons in these racially charged times, especially when he mentioned “MAGA.”

That’s ironic, considering we have a president whom The Washington Post’s Fact-checker claims has lied more than 8,000 times since he took office.

But that’s the world we live in. Self-interest rules. And maybe that’s what happened in Smollett’s case. Let’s let the courts decide.

Just remember, we don’t have to wait to see real victims from all this.

From this day forward, every victim of some hate violence will experience a new reaction when they make their claims. The knee jerk will be slower. They will enter a Smollett zone of skepticism.

It’s hard for Asian-Americans to understand how it could be any slower.

Just look at the Seaport Three — Fufai Pun, Kheong Ng-Thang and Tsz Mat Pun — all of them brutally murdered with a hammer in Brooklyn’s Sheepshead Bay in January.

Think about them every time you hear about the ongoing saga of Jussie Smollett. He may have been lying.

But the Seaport Three are real.

But white-supremacists' darling and proud gay-basher Tucker Carlson, insists otherwise!

Twice this week, Carlson brayed about the sheer awfulness of the Jussie Smollett situation. And no, Carlson didn’t say that the hoax makes it more difficult for those who are subjected to real hate crimes - he used the opportunity to whine about how the left is stoking false race hatred in order to help the Democratic party. Seriously.

Carlson began his White Power Hour week with this little screed:

""Who is dividing us? And who, exactly, is the victim in all of this? While Smollett claims that he's the victim, he tells us that he represents the most despised and unfashionable groups in America. That is why bigots doubt his story. The rest of us nod as if this were true because we're required to do that. That's how dishonest our society has become. Everyone must lie all the time. We know the rules, we have no choice.

[...]

The much-hyped epidemic of hate crimes you've heard so much about essentially is made up. The premise is absurd. America is not a hateful country, it's the most welcoming place on earth. That's why, even as our children learn from their teachers what a bigoted country this is, millions continue to stream in from Africa and Latin America for a better life here.

[...]

Stoking race hatred ensures continued power for the Democratic Party. Divided populations are easier to manipulate and rule. There would be no Democratic coalition without racial animosity. It's what holds their constituencies together. That's the point of identity politics. It is why they're forever reopening the wound.

[...]

Hate hoaxes make ethnic groups fear and distrust each other. That's a dangerous thing to do in a country that is becoming more diverse by the day.""



See, it’s really the liberals who hate America and, in their crusade to bring down white America, they make up hate crimes and, in so doing, are hurting America. Get it!

Friday, he pushed the same argument. He warned viewers that their kids will be subjected to the “lie” that “hate crimes overall are incredibly common, and the incidence of them is rising.” After playing clips of other media figures talking about hate crimes being a problem regardless of Smollett, Carlson pontificated:

""The problem with what you just heard is, it's a crock, it's totally false. In fact, it's provably untrue. Anyone who says otherwise, like the people you just heard, is either intentionally misleading you, or doesn't understand the numbers -- and that would include most journalists. Type in the phrase ‘hate crimes’ into Google and you will see story after story claiming that thousands of these atrocities take place every year in our country and the incidence of them is rising.”

He attacked the right-wing and white-nationalist favorite bogeyman, The Southern Poverty Law Center which keeps real data on real hate crimes and hate incidents:

""So, instead, reporters take their numbers wholesale from partisan activists who pose as researchers, or from wholly fraudulent organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups use moral panics to gin up fund-raising, they get rich doing it, so, of course, they continue.""

Carlson complained that the SPLC “makes up” incidents by counting accusations, not convictions. “You have to be convicted of it, and once you are, I can count what you did as a crime -- otherwise, it's just something that you said. It doesn't mean anything. In real life, hate crimes are rare.”

Really? The data (which Carlson disputes) says that hate groups are at “an all time high.” The FBI reports that hate crimes have risen 17%. So Tucker is, uh, lying to suit his agenda.

What is a crock is everything that Carlson just said.

Watch Carlson lie and propagandize below, from the February 18 and February 22, 2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight."

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Finally today, I have two names for those tempted to gloat, despair or be ashamed because of Jussie Smollett, the actor now accused of orchestrating a fake bias crime against himself. Those two names are Charles Stuart and Susan Smith.

For those who don't remember, in October, 1989, Charles Stuart sent Boston police on a tear looking for the black man he claimed forced his way into his car - after a childbirth class, no less - and then shot and wounded him and killed his pregnant wife. The governor and the mayor attended Mrs. Stuart's funeral. Police began stopping and searching men in predominantly black neighborhoods. Stuart went so far as to pick a man out of a police lineup. It was a national story highlighting what was described as a spate of violent crimes in Boston that year.

Except there was no robbery. There was no black man in a sweatsuit with red stripes. Stuart orchestrated the whole thing. It was never clear why. But when police were on the verge of arresting him due to a tip provided by a family member, Stuart took his own life.

Five years later, October, 1994 in Union, S.C., Susan Smith took her two small children to the babysitter, went to work, picked them up then drove to a lake, where she let her car roll into the water with the boys still strapped inside. She then tearfully appeared before local and national television outlets claiming that a young black man had ordered her out of the car and drove away with her boys. It took nine days before she revealed the truth. Authorities said she blamed the boys for disrupting her love life after a boyfriend broke things off.

Smith was convicted and remains in prison. But while a lot was said about why Smith did it, the trial revealed she'd experienced terrible childhood abuse and trauma. Little was ever said about the effect her lies may have had on any young black men living in that town.

So now here comes Smollett to allegedly flip that script. Instead of the scary black men terrorizing white suburbanites like the Stuarts or Smith, he invokes scary MAGA hat-wearers spewing hatred because he is black and openly gay. As you can imagine, some in the conservative media and Twitter-verse can barely contain their glee at this turn of events.

But they should try. On the very same day Smollett, who was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, federal prosecutors reveal that a white Coast Guard officer was stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and had created a list of journalists and Democratic politicians he presumably hoped to target. Prosecutors allege he was planning mass murder and perhaps that race war so pathetically, eagerly sought by white supremacists. And, as sick and sad as that sounds, if true, it's by no means the only time we've heard that story - just the latest and probably not the last.

Can I just tell you? The moral of the story for me is what it always is and always will be. The truth can hurt, but the truth will come out eventually, and it will always set you free. But for that to happen, there have to be truth tellers and truth seekers. In the case of Stuart and Smith, people close to them came forward with relevant facts. But the investigators had to be willing to receive and incorporate those facts.

The cases of Smollett and the accused Coast Guard officer, Christopher Hasson, continue to unfold. But whatever uncomfortable facts emerge about how far some will go for attention or about white supremacist leanings among those sworn to protect and defend us, about alcohol, drugs or perhaps unresolved childhood trauma, we have to be prepared to face those facts.

But Steele took his criticism of Trump to a new level on Friday when he claimed the president is ""probably not happy"" that law enforcement recently foiled massacres planned by a white nationalist.

What did Steele say?

Steele's comments came during a segment on MSNBC's Deadline: White House"" in which the entire panel castigated the president for commenting on the Jussie Smollett saga, but failing to assail white nationalism in the wake Christopher Paul Hasson's arrest.

""I guess I have, at this point, reached...my glass is no longer half-full, it's just overflowing with all the crazy that comes out of Trump,"" Steele said. ""On this one, why would we be surprised a self-proclaimed nationalist would not speak out against a self-proclaimed white nationalist?""

""These are his people,"" Steele added, referring to white nationalists.

""He's not going to thank law enforcement because he's probably not happy about what law enforcement did,"" Steele went on to say. ""That's where we are.""

Show host Nicolle Wallace said Steele's comments were brave and quickly drew him into a hypothetical, asking him what he believes Trump will do if a white nationalist is successful in carrying out massacres against politicians.

""That's the next test in all of this,"" Steele said. ""I don't know what he would do, and that's the sad spot about all of this.""

Who is Hasson?

Christopher Paul Hasson was arrested earlier this month on drug and weapons charges. He is a lieutenant in the Coast Guard and stands accused of planning assassinations of more than a dozen high-profile politicians and media members, including:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)

Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.)

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D)

MSNBC's Chris Hayes and CNN's Don Lemon

In all, 23 politicians, media members, and two socialist organizations were on Hasson's alleged hit list."

One of the alleged victims was an adult.

Each count carries a possible sentence of three to seven years in prison.

Jason Meisner, a Chicago Tribune reporter who attended the hearing, tweeted that Kelly would have to pay $100,000, or 10 percent of the $1 million, to be released on bond. Judge John Lyke Jr. also ordered Kelly to turn in his passport and barred him from contacting anyone under the age of 18, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The charges follow decades of sexual misconduct accusations, often involving minors, against the 52-year-old R&B singer. On Friday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced the charges at a news conference. Kelly turned himself in to Chicago police that evening.

listen live watch live

Foxx made a public plea for any victims to come forward in January, following the airing of Lifetime's documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly."" The six-part series closely examined the allegations against Kelly and helped to spark a new round of interest in them.

""There is nothing to be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses,"" Foxx said in a news conference on Jan. 9. ""We cannot seek justice without you.""

Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg told reporters Friday that his client, who has long denied any allegations against him, was innocent. ""I think all the women are lying,"" Greenberg said outside Kelly's studio on Friday, according to CBS Chicago.

The indictment filed Friday detail offenses committed against four individuals. The oldest allegations date to between May 1998 and May 1999, when Kelly was at least 31 and the alleged victim was under 17. The most recent allegations detailed in the indictment involve another minor and took place between May 2009 and January 2010, according to the charging documents.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who announced last week that he had given authorities a VHS tape that allegedly shows Kelly engaging in sexual activity with a minor, said in a news conference Friday evening that he represents two of Kelly's alleged victims, one of whom was included in the indictment.

Kelly was charged with child pornography in 2002 after a graphic videotape was sent to Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jim DeRogatis. Kelly was acquitted of those charges years later, in 2008. Kelly has also settled numerous lawsuits with women who have accused him of coercing them into sexual relationships while underage. In 1994, Kelly, 27, illegally married the singer Aaliyah, who was 15. To evade the fact that the underage performer would need parental permission to get married, Kelly's tour manager took her to get a fake ID.

Kelly's music career continued thriving even after the child pornography case. RCA Records, a subsidiary of Sony, kept him on their label until January. Major artists have collaborated with Kelly in recent years, including Chance the Rapper and Lady Gaga, who recorded duets with Kelly in 2015 and 2013, respectively. Both have since apologized for doing so.

The allegations against Kelly began receiving renewed scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement. BuzzFeed published a lengthy investigation by DeRogatis based on the experiences of four former members of Kelly's inner circle. The article accused Kelly of running an ""abusive cult."" In a May statement to The Post, Kelly's management said that the singer ""has close friendships with a number of women who are strong, independent, happy, well cared for and free to come and go as they please.""

Lyke, who presided over Kelly's bond hearing, is the same judge who on Thursday set 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett's bond at $100,000. Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

This was Kelly's first court appearance since his arrest on Friday. As of Friday, his arraignment is scheduled for March 8.

Judge John Lyke Jr set the bail sum, and ordered that Kelly and his associates are not to contact the four women who have accused Kelly of sexual offences. He has been ordered to hand in his passport, to prevent him attempting to flee the US.

Kelly’s lawyer Steven Greenberg had asked for a lawyer bail sum, saying the singer has financial difficulties. On hearing that his client has to surrender his passport, Greenberg joked: “Contrary to the song, he doesn’t like to fly,” a reference to ‘I Believe I Can Fly’.

In the indictment, Kelly has been accused of “sexual penetration” of women aged 13-16. The age of consent in Illinois, where the charges have been filed, is 17.

Judge Lyke Jr is the judge who oversaw the bail hearing of Empire actor Jussie Smollett this week.

Yesterday (February 22), State Attorney Kim Foxx outlined the charges against Kelly. Four charges relate to a girl identified as HW between May 1998-1999. Two charges relate to a girl identified as RL from September 1998-September 2001. LC alleges sexual abuse took place on February 18, 2003.

The most recent case in the charges is from JP. Three charges are based on her claims of sexual abuse from May 2009-January 2010.

The charges relating to RL are from a sex tape in which Foxx says: “The victim repeatedly says she is 14-years-old. Robert Kelly is seen penetrating the victim orally and vaginally.”

Foxx says that JP gave authorities a shirt with semen on it, claiming it was Kelly’s. It is alleged that Kelly repeatedly slapped and choked her and spat on her.

Kelly has previously denied all accusations of sexual abuse."

The star of the Fox show “Empire” was formally charged with filing a false police report over a bogus hate crime from January 29. He alleged that two white men in red caps punched him, doused him in bleach, and tied a rope around his neck. The actor was reportedly on his way back from Subway. It was freezing cold…and these two guys just happened to recognize him on the street. Nothing about the case made sense, but Trump is president and they wore red hats. The liberal media ran with it. They were proven wrong.

It was two Nigerian brothers. One of which was an extra on “Empire” and the other was Smollett’s former personal trainer. He reportedly paid them to execute this hoax…with a check. The two brothers are seen on surveillance footage buying the materials for the fake assault. They were considered persons of interest and cooperated fully with the police investigation that took valuable resources and manpower hours away from real crimes. So, Smollett faces a hefty fine and possibly jail time for this fiasco. And why did he execute this hate crime hoax? He was upset with his salary on the show it seems, though there is another story that he was also upset that a racist letter with white power, later determined to be aspirin, did not receive enough media attention. Oh, and he allegedly created this letter and sent it to himself. It’s a trainwreck.

Now, Smollett is saying he has an untreated drug problem, which some see as a way for him to mitigate chances of jail time should that become a possibility with the legal fallout (via Page Six):

Jussie Smollett told cops he has an untreated drug problem — raising questions about whether he might try to use the claim to at least get any potential prison sentence reduced, according to a report Friday. […] Prosecutors said Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, one of the brothers who helped Smollett allegedly stage the Jan. 29 hate attack, served as Smollett’s drug dealer, selling him Molly several times since the spring of 2018. The 36-year-old actor, in claiming to have a drug problem, could be paving the way to use it as a “mitigating factor” when it comes to sentencing, the site said.

Smollett is out on bond and he will be cut out of the last two episodes of Empire this season. If Smollett wanted the attention, he got it.

BONUS: Yes, he's become a punchline and Charles Barkley wasted no time on TNT's NBA Halftime Show. Shaq couldn't keep it together."

(He was preaching at the family’s church.) As the parents slept, the evangelist allegedly raped their 14-year-old daughter. Five years later, the man has still not faced a jury of his peers. The 14-year-old is now 19. She is in weekly therapy and can get no closure. She must hang on to the memories. She must make sure she remembers because she hopes one day the man she says raped her will finally meet justice.

A woman struggles to remember. She is one in a line of women who dated the wrong man. He allegedly beat her badly as he beat others before her. She must remember the details, and she knows her memory is going foggy as time passes by. The man is facing 20 years in prison, but like the evangelist, he has ensured his case will not go before a jury.

Both of these men and many others have hired David Ralston, the speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, to be their lawyer. One admitted he paid Ralston $20,000 to just keep delaying his trial. Ralston, as speaker, can get any case of his continued, and no judge can stop him. He has done this repeatedly for years as victims’ memories fade and justice is delayed.

This is a story ripe for national media attention. It is a story of a politician abusing his power. There are multiple female victims waiting for justice. There is even one criminal defendant who admits he paid the speaker to stop his case from proceeding. It is happening in a swing state where Republicans are at risk of losing power.

Contrast that story with one that did go national. A newspaper publisher in Alabama who had once won several journalism awards has called for the return of the KKK. National news outlets blasted the publisher, deservedly so. But is it really that big of a story?

Consider the Jussie Smollett story. Having received a death threat in the mail, Smollett was beaten up by Trump supporters on a street in Chicago. The media covered this story for days. ABC News gave a sympathetic hearing to Smollett, letting him amplify what happened and letting him blame Trump supporters. Except we now know it didn’t happen that way. Smollett is now the leading suspect in his own hate crime. The media that rushed to make this a national story fled the story as soon as it stopped working against President Trump and his supporters.

In Virginia, the governor was alleged to have worn blackface or a KKK costume, and the media pounced. The attorney general called for the governor’s ouster. Then the lieutenant governor saw multiple women accuse him of sexual assault. Then the attorney general admitted he, too, had worn blackface. Once everyone realized the next in line for the governor’s chair was a Republican, the story faded away.

Local and state political stories deserve national coverage at times. Americans are more and more dependent on national outlets to cover local stories. But national outlets tend to be more focused on narratives than facts. National reporters have a greater propensity to run in a herd while living in a bubble.

The speaker of the Georgia House is a Republican, but he retains his power with the help of Democrats in the state House. In fact, it is Republicans calling for Ralston to resign. The Democrats are perfectly happy keeping him because the alternative would be more conservative. But the Democrats will undoubtedly use the issue in 2020 to pick off Republican seats in the state Legislature. Then it will become a national story.

In fact, it seems the best way to turn a local story into a national story is to find a way to make the president or his supporters look bad. The fallback is to make the story about racial animosity. That may help a political narrative national reporters love, but it does a real disservice to news consumers and victims of real exploitation and abuse.

Days after the Empire star was charged with a felony disorderly conduct charge for allegedly filing a false police report, new reports seem to allude that Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson's claims against Smollett may have been ""overstated.""

According to sources speaking with TMZ, the FBI is still investigating the hateful letter the actor received just days before the attack and have not assessed where the letter came from.

Both federal and state law enforcement sources told the outlet that the two brothers who were involved with the alleged hate crime — Abel and Ola — may have mailed the letter because, when cops raided their apartment and seized magazines, there were pages missing from some of the publications.

Authorities are reportedly trying to determine if the pages have the lettering found in the threatening letter. They are also looking at the postage used in the letter against stamps found in the brothers' home. The Osundairo brothers have denied sending the letter.

If the brothers did send the letter, the evidence would point back to Smollett, but one source told TMZ, ""I think [Johnson] went too far. We're not there yet.""

Another report by the outlet claims that the brothers reportedly struck down the theory that Smollett paid them with a check to orchestrate the attack on himself that took place on Jan. 26.

Sources told TMZ that Smollett and the brothers previously had made a deal for them to train the actor for five weeks so he could get in shape for a music video shoot. Smollett reportedly told Ola he wanted abs like his and the brothers agreed to train the actor, also giving him 5-week nutrition plan, which would explain the $3,500 check.

A few days before the ""attack,"" Smollett wrote the brothers the check, with the memo line reading: ""5 weeks training nutrition plan.""

Sources told the publication that the brothers testified to the grand jury they were paid for the 5-week program and not for the ""attack."" Another source connected with the brothers said they felt the amount was ""a little high"" but there was never discussion of the money being part of a scheme.

Smollett continues to deny his involvement in the attack, even after Empire producers made the decision to cut him out of the final two episodes of Season 5.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,"" the actor's legal team said following his arrest, bond hearing and release on Thursday."

Officials say investigators were suspicious of Smollett from the outset.

Officers were dispatched to investigate a brutal racist, homophobic attack on Smollett early on the morning of Jan. 29. During the attack, he said, two men threw a rope around his neck, in the manner of a noose.

When officers arrived at the actor's apartment in Chicago's swanky Streeterville neighborhood about 40 minutes after the alleged beating, one detail caught their eye.

""Chicago Police Officers observed that Smollett had a rope draped around his neck,"" said Risa Lanier, a Cook County State's Attorney. ""This was captured on police body worn camera. Seconds later, Smollett asked police to shut off the cameras.""

Still, police continued for nearly three weeks to publicly identify Smollett as a victim of a possible hate crime.

That all changed after police arrested two U.S.-born brothers of Nigerian descent -- Abel and Ola Osundairo -- as they arrived in Chicago Feb. 13 from a two-week trip overseas.

Abel, 25, was a close friend and personal trainer of Smollett who provided the actorwith the club drug Ecstasy, prosecutors say. Both brothers had worked on the set of ""Empire.""

Smollett was charged this week with disorderly conduct by filing a false police report.

Prosecutors say he falsely told police that the perpetrators flung racial and homophobic slurs as they pummeled him, poured a chemical substance on him, and screamed ""This is MAGA Country,"" a reference to President Trump's 2016 campaign slogan.

He remains free on $100,000 bond as he awaits trial.

The Osundairo brothers initially resisted giving police much information. But as investigators prepared to charge them with a hate crime, prosecutors say, they came clean.

The Osundairos' defense attorney Gloria Schmidt told police her clients would give police a video statement.

The brothers said Smollett paid them $3,500 to assist with a carefully choreographed the attack, police and prosecutors say. They also said Smollett also involved in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is filmed a week earlier.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett was unsatisfied with his salary for the Fox television show and wanted to use the attack to raise his profile.

Police say they learned the details of the alleged conspiracy through their conversations with the Osundairos.

The brothers might never have made it on to detectives' radar if it weren't for an array of roughly 55 city, business and even doorbell cameras that captured snippets of the men's movements as they came to and from the crime scene.

""It was because of these (police) cameras, our investment in technology in the city of Chicago and the great assistance from the community with those other cameras that led us to a really solid timeline of where our two persons of interest went,"" said Commander Edward Wodnicki, who led the team of detectives investigating the case.

Police started with a grainy video that showed only the silhouette of two men walking away from the scene soon after the attack. Wodnicki said it was just enough for police to begin tracking the Osundairo brothers ""forward"" from the crime scene.

Footage showed the brothers jumping into a cab not far from where Smollett said he was attacked. Investigators were able to track down the cab driver, who had a security camera inside the taxi that captured the brothers' faces.

The brothers took the cab several miles to the city's North Side before they ""abruptly stopped the cab"" and began walking, police say.

At that point, Wodnicki said, investigators began looking backward in time in hopes of spotting the brothers in video footage near Smollett's home before the alleged attack occurred.

They would find footage of the brothers getting out of a taxi just blocks from the crime scene not long before the attack, Wodnicki said.

That taxi, which was also equipped with a camera, provided police with additional video footage of the Osundairos, Wodnicki said. Investigators backtracked the brothers' movements to the point where they hailed the taxi -- about two miles from the crime scene in the city's Old Town neighborhood.

Security or police cameras in Old Town captured footage of the brothers arriving in the neighborhood by Uber shortly before they got into the taxi, Wodnicki said.

From there, Wodnicki said, it took a only search warrant to figure out that Ola Osundairo had hailed the ride using his smartphone from the brothers' home on the city's North Side.

That proved to be ""the lead we needed to identify the two persons of interest,"" Wodnicki said.

Through the brothers' eventual cooperation -- as well as phone records -- investigators were able to further establish that Smollett and Abel Osundairo spoke briefly by phone a little more than an hour before the attack, according to Lanier, the prosecutor.

Smollett told Abel Osundairo during that call that the attack should be carried out at 2 a.m. at an already scouted location near the actor's home, Lanier said. Minutes later, Ola Osundairo haled the Uber and the brothers started making their way to the crime scene.

Less than 18 hours after the incident, Smollett and Abel Osundairo traded brief phone calls, Lanier said. The brothers then boarded a flight for their overseas trip. The next day, Smollett made a nearly 9-minute call to Abel in Turkey, Lanier said.

""The way that they carried this out, there was never a thought in their mind that we would be able to track (them) down,"" Johnson said. He credited the detectives' intense focus on helping cracking the case.

While the Osundairos allegedly assisted in the scheme, Wodniski indicated that police see them as victims whom Smollett was wrongly implicating in a hate crime. Prosecutors have not commented on whether the brothers have been offered immunity for their cooperation.

Bo Dietl, a former New York Police Department detective, called the brothers ""scumbags"" for taking part in the alleged hoax. Still, he said, it would be understandable if prosecutors didn't go after them.

""With cooperating witnesses, sometimes you have to weigh out culpability,"" Dietl said. ""In reality, you have to look at who is the main person. Sometimes you have to give a person a play to get to the main culprit.""

Johnson lambasted Smollett for trying to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

In the days after Smollett reported the attack, celebrities and politicians including 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Corey Booker and Kamala Harris expressed outrage.

Over the three weeks police were investigating the alleged hoax attack, Chicago endured at least 18 killings and dozens of shootings.

Among the victims of gun violence were 1-year-old Dejon Irving, who was shot in the head on Feb. 7 as he sat in a car with his siblings and grandmother. The boy remains in critical condition. Police believe the assailants were targeting his mother.

While Dejon's shooting received little national attention, Smollett's case attracted media coverage from around the globe.

""I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention, because that's who deserves the amount of attention we're giving this particular incident,"" Johnson said.

I am generally a bipartisan listener, tuning in to the left and right. I watch both Fox and MSNBC.

And just like the times I eat too much, I often feel guilty afterward about overindulging. Still, often it is hard to look away.

I was struck most recently about the polarizing story of the incredible alleged staging of a fake hate crime by ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

This was a puzzler for me because it generated so much outrage and discussion on the right-wing bandwidth.

The essential narrative there was that the biased mainstream media gullibly bought in to the story in the first place for its ripe anti-Trump elements, that a black gay guy was attacked by people wearing Trump MAGA hats. Then, goes this complaint, the biased mainstream media downplayed the subsequent unraveling of the story, in which Smollett turned from victim to perpetrator, arrested for staging the fake assault. There were, according to the new version from police, no bad white guys in MAGA hats.

This was all dissected endlessly and breathlessly by conservative radio hosts, ranting how the mainstream media was practically complicit in the scheme.

It seemed to me, on the other hand, the story got the attention and coverage you would expect when a major American metropolitan police department says a celebrity was the victim of a hate crime. And it stayed right on top of news budgets as Smollett was arrested and disgraced and his appearances pulled from ""Empire.""

What didn't seem to get a lot of talk time on right-wing radio this past week was the story of the avowed white nationalist, a Coast Guard lieutenant, who was arrested as a ""domestic terrorist"" with an alleged stockpile of weapons and hit list that included a variety of prominent liberal Democrats and media figures.

The talk on the right, with an emphasis on Smollett and the glossing over of an alleged assassination plot by a military officer, seemed to flow, as it often does, from the Trump White House.

""What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments,"" Trump tweeted about Smollett. Not a peep from the president about the arrest of a person prosecutors called ""a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life."" What Smollett is accused of is very wrong but, let's be honest, he wasn't arming himself to go on a killing rampage, targeting prominent political and media figures.

Here on eastern Connecticut talk radio, I wasn't surprised to hear conservative Stonington First Selectman Rob Simmons join the chorus of complaints that the media downplayed the Smollett story, after it turned against the black gay actor. Whatever.

But I was startled when the first selectman of the town I live in brought up the story of the arrest of the Coast Guard lieutenant — who actually once attended a short program here at the Coast Guard Academy — mentioning that our own Sen. Richard Blumenthal was on the man's hit list.

Blumenthal, Simmons suggested, had better arm himself. After all, the first selectman said, it would be too late to protect himself by just calling 911. I think this was supposed to be funny.

There was no outrage and broad condemnation for an officer accused of domestic terrorism and targeting Democrats with violence. Instead, this Republican, who once ran for the Senate seat Blumenthal won, had a warning that the senator arm himself. Yikes.

What made this more unsettling was that Simmons, moments before, had been joking about an old SUV he had traded in. The truck had running boards, he said. These were perfectly suited, he explained, in the strangest of segues, to having gunmen ride along with you.

These gun-toting riders, he explained, could stand on the running boards, hang on to the posts between the lowered front and rear windows and still be able to shoot. The ammunition could be stored in the roomy back seat.

The discussion of the Simmons gun ship went on for a little while, with lots of snickers and guffaws and talk about how the rig could be best outfitted for violence. The former congressman said it is probably down in Mexico. You know, that's where all the violence is.

The humor totally eluded me, and it all seemed especially inappropriate when the conversation turned to the arrest of a domestic terrorist targeting liberals and stockpiling weapons, with a warning that Democratic Sen. Blumenthal better arm himself.

I turned it off.

Once again, having gorged myself, I felt a little queasy.

This is the opinion of David Collins.

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed. Now, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

– Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

– Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism – until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

– University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The UD president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

– Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school’s library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

– Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

– Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. “A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,” the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

– Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election. The African-American museum director called them a “reminder of America’s dark history.” But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and centre, have yet to follow up.

– Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn’t take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose: When you’ve seen one social justice huckster, you’ve seen ’em all."

Obama talked to the young men about the virtues of monogamy. He shared his personal experiences growing up without a dad. He also offered a helpful, traditional, definition of manhood: “being responsible, working hard, being kind, respectful, compassionate.”

When identifying where messages that run contrary to his own come from, Obama decried hip-hop's negative influence.

BARACK OBAMA SLAMS POP CULTURE FOR FOISTING BAD VALUES ON YOUNG MEN

“A lot of hip-hop and rap music is built around me showing how I got more money than you, I can disrespect you and you can’t do nothing about it, I’m going to talk about you and punk you,” Obama said. In addition, he criticized the objectification of women and sexual immorality promoted by hip-hop.

I grew up influenced by hip-hop in many of the negative ways that the former president described. But I learned to make excuses for myself because I embraced a certain moral relativism, telling myself that it was OK for me to hurt myself and others because of how unfair the world was to me.

In the worldview promoted by both hip-hop and today's Democratic politics, it's as if young men of color are morally irrelevant because we are simply passengers on a train controlled by others, with no say in where we are going.

I learned this way of thinking in large part through the 1990s rappers I listened to on my CD player and watched on television. Their collective philosophy of avoiding personal responsibility was alluring to a young man angry with the world.

Years of thinking of myself as a powerless victim of an unjust world went by before I had people in my life speak to me in the way Obama spoke to those young men in Oakland: as an iconoclast knocking down false idols.

Young men in the Obama’s audience were lucky to hear that message earlier in life than I did.

There are deep roots to Obama’s vision for what a better America for young men of color looks like. With his My Brother's Keeper initiative, the former president is participating in a long and storied African-American political tradition of reminding young men that a strong moral compass makes a difference.

This tradition is present in different approaches to black political leadership – from Booker T. Washington to Marcus Garvey to Martin Luther King Jr. In this tradition, it's imperative that all people regardless of race or class turn inward when thinking about how to make the world a better place, rather than narrowly focusing on what others are doing to them or for them.

Obama occasionally invoked this political tradition when he was president, such as in his 2013 commencement address at Morehouse College. So the truth is, he hasn't changed all that much since leaving the White House.

But as president, Obama rarely criticized hip-hop’s cultural influence. Instead, he invited rappers to the White House and publicly befriended Jay-Z and Beyonce.

Obama’s mixed messages may give his criticisms today more credibility with young men who need to hear them, but his past reliance on the star power of rappers might also explain why other Democrats so rarely criticize hip-hop and its influence on young men.

Indeed, the aversion of today’s Democratic leaders to talking about culture and family is bigger than hip-hop. Democrats today seem to have no interest in encouraging young men of color to turn inward – only outward.

The Democratic Party is narrowly focused on articulating an urgent need for the U.S. government to save the American people with big, sweeping actions like the Green New Deal.

And Democrats criticize their own, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for suggesting that what a candidate believes matters far more than that candidate's race, gender or sexual orientation. Any attempt to discuss culture and family is dismissed in favor of discussing racism.

Inconsistent with Obama’s call to action in Oakland, today’s Democratic leaders appear to define young men of color by what others – rich people, white people, privileged classes – do to us and for us.

This is why it's easier to find Democratic presidential candidates on record being fooled by what police say was the staged assault of actor Jussie Smollett than it is to find the candidates talking about far more common forms of violence – like gang violence, where young men of color are not just victims but also perpetrators.

In the worldview promoted by both hip-hop and today's Democratic politics, it's as if young men of color are morally irrelevant because we are simply passengers on a train controlled by others, with no say in where we are going.

But that’s simply untrue. We need people to remind us of the moral agency each individual possesses. Obama provided such a reminder this week. Hopefully he stays on message."

Ahhh to dream. But if instead of dreaming — and working to make your dream come true - you simply signed up for as many credit cards as you could get your hands on and went on a massive spending spree that makes you feel like a billionaire?

Not only would that not make you a billionaire, it would make you the saboteur of your own financial credibility. You would eventually find yourself in massive debt, with no possible way to get out short of bankruptcy.

I mention this after watching the media equivalent of this harsh reality of life over the last month and a half. The liberal media’s dream was and is summed up in two words: Get Trump. Regardless of the facts, they were and are obsessed with getting the 45th President of the United States.

This may seem a bizarre obsession in the view of Trump supporters, conservatives and doubtless some rational others, yet undeniably, a liberal media obsession it is. But like our hypothetical billionaire-wannabe, pretending to facts instead of dealing with actual facts has led to bankruptcy — in this case a bankruptcy of journalistic credibility.

An observer can only look on in something of a gobsmacked incredulity as, just in the first month and a half of the new year alone, the media has taken one self-inflicted blow after another to its own credibility.

BuzzFeed reports a story that President Trump directed his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The story goes everywhere - then is finally and loudly disputed by none other than Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, producing headlines like this one at Fox News: “Mueller team disputes BuzzFeed report claiming Trump told Cohen to lie.”

The story was reported this way by Fox:

“Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office on Friday issued an extraordinary statement disputing a bombshell news report that claimed President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. ‘BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,’ Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, said.”

That story ran on Friday, January 18. Slightly red faces all around in the liberal media world. But hey…the world moves on.

The very next day the New York Times and the rest of its liberal media mob were headlining another story altogether. Here is the Times headline from January 19th: “Viral Video Shows Boys in ‘Make America Great Again’ Hats Surrounding Native Elder.”

That story, typical of the breed on this newest bit of news, began this way:

“They were Catholic high school students who came to Washington on a field trip to rally at the March for Life. He was a Native American elder who was there to raise awareness at the Indigenous Peoples March. They intersected on Friday in an unsettling encounter outside the Lincoln Memorial — a throng of cheering and jeering high school boys, predominantly white and wearing “Make America Great Again” gear, surrounding a Native American elder. The episode was being investigated and the students could face punishment, up to and including expulsion, their school said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. The episode was being investigated and the students could face punishment, up to and including expulsion, their school said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.”

A cascade of abuse descended. One liberal media institution, journalist and celebrity after another lost no time in assailing the Covington teenagers, one in particular.

But there was just on teensy problem here. There was more video out there. Whole reams of video, which, when the facts were finally gathered, showed another story altogether. The boys were being harassed by a group calling themselves the Black Israelites, the latter yelling obscenities at the Covington boys as the kids merely stood there waiting for their bus to pick them up.

Into this marched the “Native American elder” who waded into the crowd of boys, walking right up to 16-year old Nick Sandmann, pounding a drum inches from the boy’s face. The response from young Mr. Sandmann, wearing a Make America Great Again red hat, was to stand still and smile.

Once this came out, the nervous media backtracking began. But it was too late for Nick Sandmann, now immortalized on the Internet as some sort of racist, Trump-supporting thug. Not only had the media - again - shredded its own credibility - they were now going to be asked for something that rarely if ever happens — accountability. The recent headlines on this ran like this one from the Washington Times: “Nick Sandmann sues Washington Post for $250 million in first Covington Catholic lawsuit. Newspaper accused of 'modern-day form of McCarthyism.'”

This stunning story began:

“Attorneys for Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann filed a $250 million defamation lawsuit Tuesday against The Washington Post, accusing the newspaper of targeting the teenager in ‘a modern-day form of McCarthyism.’ The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Kentucky, came as the first of what could be dozens of lawsuits stemming from the Jan. 18 viral encounter in which Covington students initially were depicted as harassing Omaha Nation elder Nathan Phillips. The complaint argues that the newspaper falsely conveyed the impression that the 16-year-old pro-life marcher ‘engaged in acts of racism by ‘swarming’ Phillips, ‘blocking’ his exit away from the students, and otherwise engaging in racist misconduct.’”

Note well the line that stated the lawsuit against the Post “came as the first of what could be dozens of lawsuits.” Lawsuits that will target media outlets and media personalities who rushed to judgment without the facts, letting their “Get Trump” obsession overwhelm basic journalism needs to get the facts.

Now, of course, come the cases of Jussie Smollett and Andrew McCabe.

The first is the actor who claimed he was assaulted on the streets of Chicago by Trump-supporting thugs who shouted “this is MAGA country” as they beat him, dumped bleach on him and slipped a noose around his neck.

In a blink the media swallowed the story hook, line and sinker. The story line: white, racist Trump supporters assault a black, gay man. Now, we learn from the Chicago Police Department that they believe there is not a shred of truth to this tale. In fact, says the CPD, Smollett hired two Nigerian brothers to pretend to assault him.

And sure enough, in this camera-infested country, soon enough the CBS Chicago affiliate had its hands on this video that showed the two Nigerian brothers in a local store - buying a red MAGA hat. The headline:“Video Shows Brothers Linked To Jussie Smollett Attack Buying Items Allegedly Worn In Assault.”

The CBS story begins:

“CHICAGO (CBS) – CBS 2 has obtained video of two men linked to the attack on “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett buying a red hat and ski masks from a store the day before the assault.”

This put a full stop to what had been an endless parade of liberal media figures, but of course, in full “Get Trump” mode and blaming the President for the attack. Smollett was arrested and is now facing felony criminal charges. It was announced soon after that his character was to be written out of the Empire television show.

Then, of course, there is the fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who has been feeding a bonfire of phony Trump-Russia collusion stories to his media pals, finally getting fired for his efforts. And as with Jussie Smollett, the Trump obsessed media fell for his lies hoopk, line and sinker.

Not for nothing have my NewsBuster colleagues Brent Bozell and Tim Graham taken note of the interesting similarity, headlining their column: “Andrew McCabe, the Justice Department's Jussie Smollett.”

Bingo.

To suggest that all of this media insanity is disgraceful is to both understate and miss the point. And the point is very simple.

Just as our fictional wannabe-billionaire pretended to something that was in fact not financial reality and quickly compromised his financial credibility, so too now the liberal media’s “Get Trump” obsession is in the process of bankrupting its own journalistic credibility.

One doesn’t know whether Americans who wish to stay informed by real “just the facts” journalism should laugh or cry at the reality that the liberal media just can’t help itself in controlling its Get Trump obsession and the accompanying rage against Trump supporters.

But here’s one last thought. The Get Trump obsession that is bankrupting the liberal media’s credibility may find its ultimate cure in the painful remedy that is Nick Sandmann’s massive lawsuit against the Washington Post - with the promise of more to come. Once forced to serious financial accountability for its wildly irresponsible “journalism” - it may well be, at last, that a return to just-the-facts journalism is at hand.

One can hope. But the Get Trump obsession being what it is — don’t bet the ranch."

“It seems to me that what it said about America,” Maher said, “is that there is nothing as powerful as a victim, and that is a big problem in this country. He wanted to be a victim.”

Former DNC chair Donna Brazile noted it was about money and attention, saying, “I’m angry with him, I’m upset with him, and he owes not only the city of Chicago an apology––there are real-life victims out there today.”

“He played a terrible game,” she added.

Maher argued that the Smollett saga shows why “victims should be believed” is misguided:

“I feel like we’ve gone from this place where now I hear people say ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken serious. Victims should not always be believed. Take you seriously, that’s a big difference, but we seemed to have skipped that step.”

The goal is to be outrageous; a headline too close to reality can be humorous, sure, but could also swiftly morph into an actual circumstance.





Sharpe seems to be missing a core grasp on reality if he thought a Chicago police chief would outright admit to falsifying evidence. See, it's funny, because they do it, but they don't say it!

She’s making a name for herself in the fashion industry as well. Last year Williams launched her own clothing line and this year she’s continuing to make power moves in fashion. According to CNBC, Williams has been appointed to join Poshmark’s board of directors.

Poshmark is an online platform created for people across the country to sell their new and used clothing, the news outlet writes. It was founded by Manish Chandra, Tracy Sun, Gautam Golwala, and Chetan Pungaliya in 2011. The marketplace sellers collectively garnered $1 billion since the company was founded. The company is valued at nearly $600 million. Chandra—who serves as the company’s CEO—says that he believes Williams can take the brand to the next level.

“What triggered my initial interest [in Williams], is there are very few people who have that focus on excellence. What we are trying to build is a very diverse, independent board, people who can guide us to the next level of growth,” said Chandra in a statement. “Seeing she had the right experience, and the passion for fashion, that’s the way we looked at it.” He also added that the platform was developed by a team of strong women like Williams.

The tennis star is beyond excited to join the Poshmark team. She said she’s been shopping on the platform for years. “I’m really excited to join Poshmark because it really speaks to my core values,” said Williams in a statement, according to Ad Week. “They really believe in so many different aspects of my life that I am not only living but I’m also preaching.”

Williams is using Poshmark as an avenue for social good. She recently built her own closet on the platform and the proceeds from purchased items will go to the Yetunde Price Resource Center; an organization that she founded in memory of her sister who was fatally shot in Compton in 2003. The organization provides resources and programs for victims of direct or indirect senseless violence.

Kelly (all times local):

3 p.m.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it is “outrageous” that R. Kelly’s attorney asserts that the four accusers are lying about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.

Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, “We’re going to do everything in our power … to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.”

He was referring to Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.

Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly’s bond at $1 million that Kelly “is a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”

Referring to the #MeToo movement, Greenberg said, “Unfortunately, there’s this whole hashtag movement. Just because someone says something now … it doesn’t make them credible.”

2 p.m.

R. Kelly’s lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: “He is a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”

Greenberg made the comments Saturday after a judge set a $1 million bond for Kelly, who was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four females, including three who were underage at the time.

Greenberg says he’s happy with the bond amount, but Kelly doesn’t have much money because he says mismanagement by others put the singer in financial straits.

He says Kelly is trying to get the bond money together and hopes to get out of jail later Saturday.

The lawyer for R. Kelly says he thinks the four people the R&B singer is charged with sexually abusing are all lying.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. The 52-year-old Grammy winner’s lawyer said Friday that he’s confident Kelly will be vindicated.

A prosecutor told the judge at R. Kelly’s bond hearing in Chicago that the singer met one of the four people he’s charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial.

The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.

Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.

The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.

Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

R Kelly met one of the females he's accused of sexually assaulting during his 2008 child pornography trial, a court has heard.

The singer, real name Robert Kelly, appeared for a bail hearing in Chicago today and the judge was given an outline of the case against Kelly.

The court heard allegations that the musician was first acquainted with one of his accusers when she asked him for an autograph outside court.

He was being tried on child pornography charges in Chicago - of which he was acquitted - at the time.

The prosecutor told the judge that Kelly had invited the female, who was aged 16 at the time, to his house where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

Kelly appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star's bail at $1 million.

It was the same judge who oversaw Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week when the actor - accused of filing a false police report - was released on £76,693 bail.

He faced the court wearing a black hoodie and kept his hands behind his back throughout the hearing.

The singer is described as showing ""very little emotion"" and kept his eyes fixed on the floor for the majority of his time in court.

The judge described the allegations against Kelly as ""disturbing"" and ordered him not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.

Kelly's attorney reportedly argued that the star is currently broke due to a number of financial setbacks.

Attorney Steven Greenberg is said to have told the judge Kelly has a child support judgement against him that he's unable to pay and he's not making any money.

Greenberg claimed Kelly's earning very little from his music and is not touring.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

He has spent years fending off sex abuse allegations and has previously denied any wrongdoing.

American advocacy groups and police have a shared concern over the fallout from allegations that an openly gay black TV actor faked a hate-motivated assault: that future victims will face more skepticism even as hate crimes are on the rise.

Chicago police have accused Jussie Smollett of engineering an elaborate hoax to exploit Americans' anxieties over political and racial divisions in order to generate publicity and a bigger paycheck.

The 36-year-old star of the Fox drama ""Empire"" allegedly sent himself a threatening letter and then hired two acquaintances to stage a street attack in downtown Chicago, complete with homophobic and racial slurs, while invoking Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Smollett is charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was freed Thursday on $100,000 bond.

""If true, then this is a disgraceful exploitation of many past victims of real hate crimes, many of whom have endured heinous suffering,"" Kami Chavis, a former assistant US attorney in the George W Bush administration, told AFP.

The actor's lawyers, in a defiant statement, criticized law enforcement's actions as an organized ""spectacle"" and maintained Smollett's innocence.

But whatever the final result, the case has left gay rights and racial justice advocates, along with politicians and government officials, worried about future victims. Will they be believed?

- Worry over 'skepticism' -

""Bogus police reports cause real harm,"" an angry Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson told a news conference Thursday, after detailing what his detectives learned over a three-week investigation.

""My concern is that hate crimes will now publically be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen,"" Johnson said.

The initial news of the purported attack at the end of January generated an outpouring of support for Smollett, who in the past has lent his celebrity to gay rights, racial equality and other causes.

But as the case -- with disturbing details such as a rope allegedly put around Smollett's neck -- appeared to turn and the actor went from victim to suspect, many who had rushed to condemn the attack were left struggling to respond.

On Friday, the producers of ""Empire,"" after repeatedly standing by the actor before he was officially charged, said he would be removed from the final two episodes of the current season ""to avoid further disruption on set.""

Rights advocacy groups and activists fell mostly silent as details leaked out of the investigation. But they eventually focused on a common theme: hate crimes are happening with increasing frequency even if the Smollett case turns out not to be one.

- More hate crimes -

The FBI says that during the incendiary first year of President Donald Trump's term in 2017, the number of hate crimes rose 17 percent nationwide. Last year's figures are not yet available.

The Southern Poverty Law Center in 2018 counted an all-time high 1,020 hate groups in the United States.

The most recent report from the Anti-Defamation League found anti-Semitic incidents surged 60 percent in 2017.

In 2018, 26 transgender people were killed, most were black trans women, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

""As we learn more details about Jussie's arrest, we remain focused on the urgent fight against the very real issues of racism, homophobia, and hate violence,"" said a joint statement from Color of Change and GLAAD, which are focused on racial justice and gay rights issues, respectively.

Chavis, who is an expert on hate crimes laws and is director of the Criminal Justice Program at Wake Forest University's law school, says hate crimes victims have already faced big obstacles.

""There is a long history of these victims not being believed,"" Chavis said.

""Jussie Smollet's actions should not deter law enforcement officials, prosecutors and jurors in future cases.""

But could it deter public support?

- Media 'played for fools' -

Critics have pointed out that in the initial rush to support an apparent hate crime victim, many celebrities, commentators and politicians condemned the attack with little scrutiny of the underlying claims.

""The media should be the most outraged. He played all of them for fools,"" tweeted Nikki Haley, Trump's former UN ambassador.

Politicians have had to awkwardly back-pedal from their original comments, such as Senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate.

She had initially called the Smollett case one of ""attempted modern day lynching.""

But when asked by a reporter earlier this week on the campaign trail in New Hampshire about her thoughts on Smollett, Harris initially hesitated and appeared to grasp for a response.

On Thursday night, she posted on Facebook that she was ""sad, frustrated, and disappointed,"" while turning the attention back on victims.

""We must speak the truth: hate crimes are on the rise in America,"" Harris said.

""Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address."""

For days now, Harris has been keeping a low profile and avoiding questions over her calling the fake MAGA attack on Smollett an “attempted modern day lynching.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching.

Information Liberation reports: She and Cory Booker also exploited the allegedly staged attack to get a bill passed to expand federal hate crimes to include “lynching.”

Harris finally issued a statement on Thursday after Smollett was officially arrested saying we should not focus exclusively on Smollett’s staged attack because that “distracts” from the “truth” that “hate crimes are on the rise in America.”

Harris’s statement said:

Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I’m sad, frustrated, and disappointed. When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward. At the same time, we must speak the truth: hate crimes are on the rise in America. Just last year, the FBI released statistics that revealed a 17 percent increase in the number of hate crimes in America. Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from that truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address. We should not allow that. I will always condemn racism and homophobia. We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice. That is what I will keep fighting for.

Perhaps hate crimes are increasing because congress is passing laws (based off lies) to expand what constitutes a “hate crime”?

Could it be possible that the utter hysteria fake hate crimes like these have created are causing prosecutors to be more aggressive in charging people with hate crimes?

There’s many possible explanations beyond “white people bad.”

Incidentally, you’ll never guess who hate crimes are rising the fastest against!

Might it be that all the racial animus drummed up by the fake news media and politicians like Harris is having real world consequences?"

Despite Jussie Smollett’s arrest for allegedly staging his own attack, he still maintains his innocence. In fact, some of friends and close family member believes he is, and a close source has shared new details to possibly help prove that.

RELATED: Jussie Smollett Claims He Has An Untreated Drug Problem

According to TMZ, sources say the brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, made a deal with Jussie, not for the attack, but to train him for 5 weeks so he could get in shape for an upcoming music video. Jussie reportedly had said to Ola that he wanted abs like his. Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a 5-week nutrition plan.

The sources add that Jussie told the brothers he would pay them for their services, but no specific amount was discussed. It was also said that Ola and Abel even told the grand jury they were paid for the 5-week program and not for the “attack.” As we reported, Jussie wrote the brothers a check for $3,500. The memo line read, “5 weeks training nutrition plan,” but Chicago PD reportedly believes it was to help Jussie stage his attack.

The singer, real name Robert Kelly, appeared for a bail hearing in Chicago today and the judge was given an outline of the case against Kelly.

The court heard allegations that the musician was first acquainted with one of his accusers when she asked him for an autograph outside court.

He was being tried on child pornography charges in Chicago - of which he was acquitted - at the time.

The prosecutor told the judge that Kelly had invited the female, who was aged 16 at the time, to his house where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

Kelly appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star's bail at $1 million.

It was the same judge who oversaw Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week when the actor - accused of filing a false police report - was released on £76,693 bail.

He faced the court wearing a black hoodie and kept his hands behind his back throughout the hearing.

The singer is described as showing ""very little emotion"" and kept his eyes fixed on the floor for the majority of his time in court.

The judge described the allegations against Kelly as ""disturbing"" and ordered him not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.

Kelly's attorney reportedly argued that the star is currently broke due to a number of financial setbacks.

Attorney Steven Greenberg is said to have told the judge Kelly has a child support judgement against him that he's unable to pay and he's not making any money.

Greenberg claimed Kelly's earning very little from his music and is not touring.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

He has spent years fending off sex abuse allegations and has previously denied any wrongdoing.

R&B star R. Kelly was arrested on Friday evening after having been indicted on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in Cook County, Ill. On Saturday afternoon, a judge set bond at $ 1 million.

A police spokesman confirmed Friday night that Kelly was under arrest and in police custody; Kelly turned himself in at Chicago’s 1st District-Central police station.

Member station WBEZ reports that on Saturday afternoon, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. — the same judge who set Jussie Smollett‘s bond earlier this week — set Kelly’s bond at $1 million dollars: $250,00 per victim. However, Kelly is being allowed to go free as he awaits trial after posting $100,000, or 10 percent of the bond.

Kimberly Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney, announced the charges against Kelly during a brief press conference held in Chicago on Friday afternoon. She said that a grand jury indicted the singer, born Robert Kelly, on 10 counts involving four alleged victims, whom Foxx identified as “H.W.,” “R.L.,” “L.C.” and “J.P.”

Foxx said that three of the women — “H.W.,” “R.L.” and “J.P.” — were all under age 17 at the time of the alleged incidents, which reportedly took place over more than a decade, from 1998 to 2010. Kelly, now age 52, would have been in his 30s or 40s in that time frame.

At Saturday afternoon’s bond hearing, Kelly was also ordered to turn over his passport and told not to be in contact with any of the four alleged victims.

Foxx, who took no questions at Friday’s press conference, noted that each count is a Class 2 felony in Illinois and a probational offense that carries a potential sentence of three to seven years.

According to Illinois law, the statute of limitations has not run out on the alleged incidents.

Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, did not immediately return NPR’s request for comment. But he has maintained his client’s innocence regarding all allegations, as has Kelly himself.

Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Greenberg maintained his client’s innocence; the AP quotes Greenberg as saying that Kelly is “extraordinarily disappointed and depressed. He is shellshocked by this.”

Greenberg also claimed to the AP that he proposed meeting with prosecutors before the charges were filed but that his offer was refused.

The Cook County indictment comes amid revived controversy around the singer, which came to a boil last month when the Lifetime TV network aired a six-part docuseries called Surviving R. Kelly that features more than 50 interviewees and lays out 25 years of allegations against Kelly dating back to the early 1990s. The series includes on-camera interviews with several women who have come forward publicly with their accusations. More recent allegations against the singer emerged in a 2017 BuzzFeed investigation. The BuzzFeed piece reported accusations that Kelly runs a sex “cult” composed of women whom he regularly abuses — and it helped uncork a torrent of outrage, including the #MuteRKelly protest movement.

Yet for all the fresh anger that followed the publication of the BuzzFeed piece, allegations of sexual misconduct by R. Kelly are nothing new: Questions have swirled around his behavior with teenage girls since at least 1994, when R. Kelly — then 27 — briefly married his 15-year-old protégée, Aaliyah. The marriage was annulled within months.

Since then, Kelly has faced a series of lawsuits and allegations, none with graver legal consequences than the charge that he videotaped himself having sex with and performing lewd acts on an underage girl. The tape’s existence was revealed in 2002 by Chicago journalists — including Jim DeRogatis, who would write the BuzzFeed story a decade and a half later — and resulted in Kelly’s arrest just months later.

In 2002, Kelly was charged with more than a dozen counts related to child pornography. But due to a variety of delays, he did not go to trial until 2008, at which point he was acquitted on all counts. (Neither the young woman who reportedly appeared in the 2002 tape nor her parents testified in Kelly’s trial, though several other family members and friends did identify her during the court proceedings.)

Within days of Surviving R. Kelly having aired, public pressure against the singer mounted dramatically. Some of his previous collaborators — such as Lady Gaga — began to publicly distance themselves from him. And his label, RCA Records, owned by Sony Music Entertainment, bowed to the pressure and dropped the singer last month.

This month, CNN reported that its newsroom had seen a newly surfaced VHS tape that prominent lawyer Michael Avenatti says he has given to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

CNN described the tape as being over 45 minutes long and said it shows a man who appears to be Kelly and a teenage girl; both the man and the teenager repeatedly refer to her purported age, 14 years old. The video, CNN says, shows the man and the girl in a number of sexual acts as well as the man urinating on the teenager. Those acts are similar to the ones that Kelly was alleged to have committed on the 2002 tape.

After Cook County held its press conference, Avenatti held his own press event in Chicago on Friday afternoon. He stated that he is currently representing six individuals related to the Kelly allegations: two young women — “at least one” of whom, he said, was named as a victim in Friday’s indictment — as well as two parents of one of the women who is believed to be currently living with Kelly, and two people whom Avenatti referred to as “whistleblowers” who have been part of Kelly’s “inner circle” for more than 20 years.

During his press conference, Avenatti asserted many of the same details about the newly surfaced tape as CNN described them. He also alleged that there are two other videotapes — one already in his possession and one that he alleges he is “in the process of recovering” — that purport to show Kelly sexually abusing women. Avenatti said that he plans to turn those tapes over to Foxx’s office as well.

Avenatti also said that he has evidence that a number of “enablers” worked to “rig” the 2008 trial against Kelly, including by paying off witnesses.

On Thursday, lawyer Gloria Allred held a press conference with two more women, Rochelle Washington and Latresa Scaff, who allege that Kelly pursued them for sex when they were teenagers in an incident that they say happened more than 20 years ago."

Jordan is investing in the futures of young boys of color who want to pursue careers in the entertainment industry. According to the Huffington Post, Jordan is teaming up with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative and the Obama Foundation for the creation of a fellowship for aspiring actors.

Michael B. Jordan announced a new filmmaking fellowship program for young men of color. https://t.co/X8OXtrWhEl — HuffPost (@HuffPost) February 22, 2019

The fellowship will be created under his production company Outlier Society Productions, the news outlet writes. Jordan says he wants to use the program as an avenue to increase representation in the entertainment industry by opening career pathways.

“When you get in a position of power or you get a little bit of leverage to help create opportunities for other people. I think that’s really, really important. It’s something I always promised myself that once I got a production company, I would be able to do that,” said Jordan in a statement. “We’re starting an Outlier fellowship, an internship. Basically, we’re going to select certain young black men, people of color, people from underrepresented groups across the board, and place them in major companies throughout the entertainment industry.”

Fellowships like the one created by Jordan are needed. According to the 2019 Hollywood Diversity Report, although there has been some progress made regarding diversity in the entertainment industry, we still have a long way to go. People of color make up only 12.6 percent of writers and 7.8 percent of directors. “Over time, as it became clear that audiences were becoming more diverse and that they were demanding diverse content, diversity itself was seen as a business imperative,” Darnell Hunt, who co-authored the report and serves as a professor at UCLA, told NPR. “That’s a relatively new phenomenon that … most people would not have been talking about that, you know, five, 10 years ago. Today, everyone’s talking about it.”

""I think all the women are lying,"" Greenberg said outside Kelly's studio on Friday, according to CBS Chicago.

""There is nothing to be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses,"" Foxx said in a news conference on January 9. ""We cannot seek justice without you.""

Foxx made a public plea for any victims to come forward in January, following the airing of Lifetime's documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly."" The six-part series closely examined the allegations against Kelly and helped to spark a new round of interest in them.

The charges follow decades of sexual misconduct accusations, often involving minors, against the 52-year-old R&B singer. On Friday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced the charges at a news conference. Kelly turned himself in to Chicago police that evening.

The indictment filed Friday detail offenses committed against four individuals. The oldest allegations date to between May 1998 and May 1999, when Kelly was at least 31 and the alleged victim was under 17. The most recent allegations detailed in the indictment involve another minor and took place between May 2009 and January 2010, according to the charging documents.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who announced last week that he had given authorities a VHS tape that allegedly shows Kelly engaging in sexual activity with a minor, said in a news conference Friday evening that he represents two of Kelly's alleged victims, one of whom was included in the indictment.

Kelly was charged with child pornography in 2002 after a graphic videotape was sent to Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jim DeRogatis. Kelly was acquitted of those charges years later, in 2008. Kelly has also settled numerous lawsuits with women who have accused him of coercing them into sexual relationships while underage. In 1994, Kelly, 27, illegally married the singer Aaliyah, who was 15. To evade the fact that the underage performer would need parental permission to get married, Kelly's tour manager took her to get a fake ID.

Kelly's music career continued thriving even after the child pornography case. RCA Records, a subsidiary of Sony, kept him on their label until January. Major artists have collaborated with Kelly in recent years, including Chance the Rapper and Lady Gaga, who recorded duets with Kelly in 2015 and 2013, respectively. Both have since apologized for doing so.

The allegations against Kelly began receiving renewed scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

With Empire choosing to cut Jussie Smollett from the season’s final two episodes in the midst of the news that he likely staged his hate-crime attack last month in Chicago, the fate of his character, Jamal Lyon, is looking even more questionable. According to TV Line, producers on the Fox drama are reportedly weighing a bunch of options on how to proceed with Smollett’s character if Empire returns for season six, and one of the solutions currently in discussion is hiring a new actor to portray Jamal in a recast. Lee Daniels, the show’s co-creator, is apparently “a strong proponent of the recast option.”

On Friday, the creatives behind Empire confirmed Smollett will not be appearing in the rest of the season, in order to “avoid further disruption on set” after the “disturbing allegations” against him came to light. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” they said. “We are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.” Smollett was charged this week with making a false police report, which is a felony disorderly conduct charge that could bring jail time and/or monetary fines. Smollett was subsequently released on a $100,000 bond."

Rep. Nick Zerwas, R-Elk River, described the measure, expected later this session, as ""a reasonable step to help deter individuals from filing false police reports and to make sure that we devote law enforcement's limited resources to investigating and prosecuting legitimate bias-motivated crimes.""

Zerwas said he was motivated to bring the issue forward after recent reports that police believed ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett may have staged a January attack by two masked men shouting racial and anti-gay slurs. Smollett has denied that claim through his lawyers.

In recent days, Zerwas has written about the case in multiple posts on Twitter, describing it as part of a ""recent rise in fake victimization"" and a symptom of media bias.

""As news reports continue to emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that the highly publicized alleged hate crime in Chicago last month was a hoax,"" Zerwas said Wednesday. ""We need to send a message that similar hoaxes are not welcome in Minnesota as they only seek to divide us and distract from legitimate acts of bias-motivated violence.""

Minnesota's current law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly make a false report to law enforcement, and a gross misdemeanor to falsely report criminal police misconduct. Zerwas wants to make it a gross misdemeanor — punishable by up to a year in jail and/or a $3,000 fine — to falsely report a hate crime.

Zerwas' legislative push comes amid an ongoing rise in reported hate crimes in Minnesota, and the country, figures that are already widely viewed as failing to account for the actual rate of such crimes.

A spokeswoman for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which collects bias-crime data from Minnesota agencies to send to the FBI, said the BCA does not track how many reports are later determined to be false.

The FBI reported last year that hate crimes climbed more than 22 percent in Minnesota, up from 119 in 2016 to 146 in 2017, the most recent year for which data was available.

The bureau relies on voluntary reporting from law enforcement agencies. But Minnesota law enforcement approach classifying and reporting hate crimes differently — according to the FBI's latest report, more than 310 police agencies reported zero hate crimes in 2017. That included Bloomington, where members of an Illinois militia bombed the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center because, as one member later admitted, they wanted to intimidate Muslims.

R&B singer R Kelly has appeared in court in Chicago where a judge has set bail at one million dollars (£766,000).

The judge at Saturday's hearing, Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, is the same judge who presided over Empire actor Jussie Smollett's bail hearing earlier this week.

Kelly was charged on Friday with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time.

Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx says the alleged abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.

The 52-year-old Grammy winner's lawyer said Friday that he was confident Kelly would be vindicated.

Judge Fitzgerald Lyke Jr said during Saturday's hearing that the bail amount equalled 250,000 dollars for each of the four people he is charged with sexually abusing.

He called the allegations against Kelly ""disturbing"" during the hearing.

The singer stared at the floor while the judge was speaking and looked dejected.

Kelly had spent the night in jail before being taken to the court.

He stood with his hands behind his back and said to the judge: ""How are you?""

Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said his client was not a flight risk and told the judge: ""Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn't like to fly.""

The bail requires Kelly to post 100,000 dollars (£76,000) to be released.

A prosecutor told the judge that Kelly met one of the four accusers at his 2008 trial on child pornography charges.

The two met when he gave her an autograph, and the alleged abuse occurred between 2009 and 2010.

The accuser gave law enforcement a shirt that had Kelly's DNA on it, the prosecutor said.

Kelly has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

After the hearing, Greenberg told reporters that he thought all four of the accusers were lying.

""He did not force anyone to have sex. He's a rock star. He doesn't have to have non-consensual sex,"" Greenberg said."

Lying has had a banner week, all told. Given how far we’ve sunken into a truthless age ruled by man who lies as easily as he breathes, that’s saying a lot. But those falsehoods are ordinary in their cluelessness. In order for whoppers to really get our attention, they have to have an air of theatricality to them.

Advertisement:

This is why Jussie Smollett’s alleged filing of a false claim of a crime is transfixing as well as distressing. If he did fabricate an elaborate tale of a racially-motivated assault, going on a national news outlet to vehemently, tearfully make his case as part of the bargain, then this isn’t merely a matter of lying stupidly but also committing the sin of terrible stagecraft.

Pop’s new series “Flack” proves how crucial proper staging can be when the goal is to maintain an image and sell a lie. Anna Paquin’s publicity diva Robyn is the queen of bluffing and mistress of obfuscation in that regard, able to talk her clients into anything for the sake of protecting their almighty image, which is everything.

Robyn is one of the senior spin doctors at a crisis PR firm based in London and run by women, with Sophie Okonedo’s calculating, unforgiving Caroline running the place and Lydia Wilson’s soul-bereft Eve as Robyn’s best frenemy and effective partner in professional fabrication. Since “Flack” is technically a dramedy, the place also employs an innocent, Melody (Rebecca Benson), a fresh intern ready to be abused and battered into submission or, worse, into another PR agent.

Advertisement:

Together, the women weave a tapestry of falsehood into lucrative deals for their clients. Glimpses of Robyn’s home life with her boyfriend (Arinzé Kene) and her sister Ruth (Genevieve Angelson) are far different than her daytime adventures in babysitting cokeheads, indulging in the occasional bump along the way even though she’s trying, intermittently, to get sober.

“Flack” has a devilish crackle to it that makes it highly watchable, and it part it’s the brazen construction of falsehoods and id-driven immorality that makes each episode such a rush. Paquin is a devil in spiky heels here, quite different from Sookie Stackhouse or any of her past figures, and watching her pummel feckless overgrown children into submission with a barrage of dialogue informing them of the precision and means by which she intends to destroy them is a blissful experience. Naturally she goes too far at times, even talking people into ruining themselves to protect their spouses. What's a marriage in comparison to an endorsement deal?

Robyn is a creature of her choices as well. Allusions to a childhood surviving a mentally ill mother explain her expertise with hiding her emotions and her willingness to disregard the feelings of those around her that she perceives as incapable and weak. Since she is the heroine of this tale, she’s also trying to be better, although in her wordless asides it’s obvious she doesn’t quite buy that there’s any real benefit or purpose in being good in this world.

Advertisement:

Lies pay the bills after all, and “Flack” promotes that thesis with a touch of skepticism about the dark deals its protagonists make. Robyn is brilliant at building moats of deflection and filling them up with enough falsifications to drown all the saints, but she’s never entirely at ease with it, in part because she’s in a tug of war with her own humanity.

This is where “Flack” evolves into something more than a ribald, id-driven lark. Behind the outrageous interludes showcasing Robin using persuasive fibbing to guide her clients through every kind of extravagant embarrassment, she’s confronted with the pressures all women must face. For her, though, it’s not merely a choice between career and starting a family, but defining which life allows her to be more honest with herself. “Flack” turns over these questions through Robyn but also via her friends and loved ones; her sister Ruth, strapped down with kids and a doting husband hiding a few of his own secrets, is softly envious of Ruth but often chides her messiness. She encounters young parents all the time who seem tired and out of their depth, and can’t quite make up which version of fatigue is better, the kind born out of a night kept up by a squalling infant or one featuring too many rails of white powder and tequila shots.

Advertisement:

The lying is tiring too, but “Flack” doesn’t hide how much of a rush it gives Robyn and her cohort or its necessary role in maintaining the status quo. “The world keeps turning, Robyn,” Caroline purrs to her charge with a chill in her voice. “We just help push.” As long as they’re skilled at it, everyone plays along.

“Whiskey Cavalier,” previews Sunday after the Oscars; Wednesdays at 10 p.m., ABC

It’s always better when the lies are sexy and have a purpose, right? Honestly, any ruse constructed to serve the greater good, God and country, is worth the fallout. We make such deals with ourselves when we align our affections with heroes who also happen to be killers and spies.

Advertisement:

“Whiskey Cavalier” follows a crack team of characters led by FBI agent Will Chase (Scott Foley), for whom the series is named, and his CIA counterpart Frankie Trowbridge (Lauren Cohan), an efficient agent who has killed a lot of people with few regrets. This being an ABC spy series, the pair is drawn in the classic will-they-or-won’t-they pattern, with Foley cast as a hopeless softy who, when we first met him, is wallowing in despair after his girlfriend dumps him. To ease his pain he takes on a mission to retrieve an asset, unaware that Frankie is somewhat on the same mission.

Shenanigans ensue and a few yaddas later, they’re all working together on a unit that includes a tech wizard (Tyler James Williams), a psych (Ana Ortiz) and Vir Das as, um . . . another spy?

Point is, they’re all sexy people zipping around the world and stopping international criminals, often using bullets and explosives. Doing so requires them to assume false identities, double cross trusting rubes and win over the audience with witty banter. Frequently Will's colleagues have to warn him to keep his big sloppy heart in its case. ""Agent: DO . . . NOT . . . EMPATHIZE"" is an actual line of dialogue, and it sounds totally believable because look: the agent in question is played by the hottie from ""Scandal."" Not lying president hottie but, you know, the other one.

It’s your basic post-Shonda, post-“Castle” kind of ABC hour — full of snap and humor, easy on the grimness. Lots of people take bullets in the bobo, and many vehicles explode, but all that happens in some of the world’s prettiest capital cities at the hands of incredibly telegenic people.

That makes the violence plucky and entertaining, almost charming. Sexy, even. Under those circumstances, who cares if the nothing about this situation feels honest or believable? This is television, where anything false can be believed if the messenger is hot enough."

Kelly (all times local):

3 p.m.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it's ""outrageous"" that R. Kelly's attorney questions whether the singer's accusers are telling the truth about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.

Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, ""We're going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.""

He was referring to Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.

Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million that Kelly ""is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

R. Kelly's lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

Greenberg made the comments Saturday after a judge set a $1 million bond for Kelly, who was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four females, including three who were underage at the time.

Greenberg says he's happy with the bond amount, but Kelly doesn't have much money because he says mismanagement by others put the singer in financial straits.

He says Kelly is trying to get the bond money together and hopes to get out of jail later Saturday.

The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.

Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.

The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.

The charges follow decades of sexual misconduct accusations, often involving minors, against the 52-year-old R&B singer. On Friday, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced the charges at a news conference. Kelly turned himself in to Chicago police that evening.

The indictment filed Friday detail offenses committed against four individuals. The oldest allegations date to between May 1998 and May 1999, when Kelly was at least 31 and the alleged victim was under 17. The most recent allegations detailed in the indictment involve another minor and took place between May 2009 and January 2010, according to the charging documents.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who announced last week that he had given authorities a VHS tape that allegedly shows Kelly engaging in sexual activity with a minor, said in a news conference Friday evening that he represents two of Kelly's alleged victims, one of whom was included in the indictment.

Kelly was charged with child pornography in 2002 after a graphic videotape was sent to Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jim DeRogatis. Kelly was acquitted of those charges years later, in 2008. Kelly has also settled numerous lawsuits with women who have accused him of coercing them into sexual relationships while underage. In 1994, Kelly, 27, illegally married the singer Aaliyah, who was 15. To evade the fact that the underage performer would need parental permission to get married, Kelly's tour manager took her to get a fake ID.

Kelly's music career continued thriving even after the child pornography case. RCA Records, a subsidiary of Sony, kept him on their label until January. Major artists have collaborated with Kelly in recent years, including Chance the Rapper and Lady Gaga, who recorded duets with Kelly in 2015 and 2013, respectively. Both have since apologized for doing so.

The allegations against Kelly began receiving renewed scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement. BuzzFeed published a lengthy investigation by DeRogatis based on the experiences of four former members of Kelly's inner circle. The article accused Kelly of running an ""abusive cult."" In a May statement to The Post, Kelly's management said that the singer ""has close friendships with a number of women who are strong, independent, happy, well cared for and free to come and go as they please."""

Kelly was set at $1 million on Saturday during a bond hearing on charges of alleged aggravated criminal sexual abuse of four young women, three of whom were underage. He was also made to surrender his passport and told not to have contact with any of his victims or anyone under the age of 18.

During the packed hearing at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, Judge John Lyke Jr. set the bail amount, which allows Kelly to pay only $100,000 in order to be released from the Cook County Jail before his trial. The judge also set Feb. 25 as his next court date.

Before bail was set, R. Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, argued that the singer was having money problems because he had been recently dropped from his label and called the victims in the case “liars.”

New details were released by Prosecutor Kim Foxx regarding the nature of the offenses against the young women – three of whom R. Kelly sexually abused and ranged in age from 14 to 16. The fourth victim was 24 at the time of her alleged incident.

—R. Kelly must pay nearly $200K in back child support by March 6, or go to jail—

One of the girls is said to have met Kelly at a restaurant while celebrating her 16th birthday. One of the members of his entourage slipped her Kelly’s business card with his cell phone on it. Her mother intercepted and told Kelly’s manager that her daughter was just 16. The daughter reportedly later retrieved the card from her mother’s purse and called R. Kelly and he gave her the address to his studio and instructed her to take a cab there after her father dropped her off at school the next day. After their first alleged sexual encounter, the girl was given an envelope which contained a large sum of money. This began an alleged monthly arrangement where Kelly would engage in sexual activities with her from 1998 until 1999.

Another victim he allegedly had vaginal and oral sex with was a then 14-year-old girl, whom Kelly captured on video. In the video, the victim repeatedly makes references to the fact that she was 14 years old, according to Foxx, who is in possession of the video.

Another of the underage victim’s met Kelly at his 2008 trial. She at the time believed that he was innocent. He gave her his number and later had sex with her.

—Jussie Smollett may have conceived of an alleged hoax after the attack on Lee Daniels’ gay cousin—

The fourth victim was a then 24-year-old hairdresser that Kelly was supposed to have braid his hair. When Kelly entered the room he reportedly told her he didn’t want his hair braided but needed her to massage his head while taking off his pants and motioning to his penis. He allegedly tried to physically force her to perform oral sex on him and then he spit in her face when she resisted. Kelly allegedly masturbated and ejaculated onto the victim’s shirt and that shirt will be presented as evidence during the upcoming trial.

“The audacity. He thought he was untouchable,” commented attorney, Caroline Polisi, in a CNN interview in which she said she was “disgusted” to hear the details of each case. Polisi is representing George Papadopoulos in a DNC lawsuit.

Inside the packed courtroom were family members of the victims and people who came out in support of the singer. The judge warned everyone that if anyone yelled out anything, he or she would be remanded into custody themselves “because he could feel the emotion in that room,” CNN said."

Kelly’s bail has been set at $US1 million in his sexual abuse case.

He will need to pay $US100,000 to be released from jail ahead of trial.

Judge John Lyke Jr., who set bail in the case of ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett, said that if Kelly was freed he would need to surrender his passport.

Kelly is being jailed on 10 counts of sexual abuse against three minors and one adult.

Appearing in court on Saturday facing new sexual abuse charges for the first time, R. Kelly was told that his bail would be set at $US1 million. The decision means that Kelly will need to pay $US100,000 to be released from jail ahead of his trial, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Judge John Lyke Jr., who also set bail in the case of ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett, reportedly said that if Kelly produced the money, he would need to surrender his passport to prevent him from fleeing the country, and forbade him from communicating with minors. Kelly is accused of the sexual abuse of three individuals who were under the age of 17.

Kelly reportedly frowned at the judgment and was ordered to next appear in court on Monday. He’s been housed in the Cook County Jail since Friday night, where he surrendered himself for arrest following the announcement of the 10 charges against him.

Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against four individuals following the submission of new evidence to the Cook County attorney’s office. A video submitted to the county by Michael Avenatti and his client reportedly shows Kelly engaging in sex acts with a minor, who acknowledged her age on tape. Kelly reportedly acknowledged that she is a minor on film as well. Avenatti says that there are other incriminating tapes Kelly as well.

The new developments in Kelly’s case follow the release of the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which documents numerous allegations of sexual abuse against the artist.

Following the release of the documentary, the Cook County attorney Kim Foxx made an open call for new evidence against Kelly, who was previously exonerated of child pornography charges after another tape that appeared to show him engaged in sex acts with a minor went public.

Besides the charges he faced Saturday, Kelly is also reportedly under numerous federal investigations from the FBI, IRS, DHS, and ICE.

The next court date was scheduled for Monday.

Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, surrendered to police Friday and was jailed overnight before the bond hearing.

Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Gonzalez read off evidence against him in four separate cases between 1998 and 2010. The Chicago-born R&B superstar wore a black hoodie and jeans as he stared at the ground in the Leighton Criminal Court Building.

In the four separate cases, Kelly is charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. He is accused of using force or the threat of force.

In the same courtroom in 2008, he was was acquitted of child pornography charges. Kelly was arrested in a child pornography case in 2002 when he was 35.

In the current case, three children were older than 13 but younger than 17. There is no age range listed for one of the alleged victims.

Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, said the charges in one of the cases involve the same woman who was named as the victim in the 2002 child pornography indictment.

""I think all the women are lying,"" attorney Steve Greenberg said Friday. ""Mr. Kelly is strong, he's got a lot of support and he's going to be vindicated on all these charges -- one by one if it has to be.""

In January, a docuseries called Surviving R. Kelly on Lifetime television included women who said they were kept in abusive sexual relationships with the music artist.

""Everything in that documentary was a rehash of things they've known for years,"" Greenberg said. ""The police have investigated, the prosecutors investigated. The jury heard, and everybody rejected it."""

Queen Latifah is coming home to Newark and building $14M worth of new housing https://t.co/GhP6SbZqLf pic.twitter.com/OxI5mwPVBp — NJ.com (@njdotcom) February 21, 2019

The project—which is reportedly going to cost $14 million—will be a community of multi-family townhouses, the news outlet writes. The homes—which will be located on Springfield Ave. and South 17th Street—will include 20 three-family townhomes and an additional mix-use building that will have 16 units. The mix-use building will feature a fitness center and commercial space that will be used by nonprofit organizations. 60 of the units will be market rate starting with a price of $1,800 and 16 of the units will be affordable and based on an individual’s income.

The project is being led by BlueSugar Corporation—where Latifah serves as co-president—and GonSosa Development. BlueSugar Corporation has been on a mission to revitalize struggling neighborhoods across the country and GonSosa Development has reconstructed and developed over 1,000 units.

There is a need for affordable housing in Newark and those who are involved in the project are excited about making change. “They understand how difficult it is to make ends meet for many residents and want to be part of the solution. They remain dedicated to making life better in communities like Newark,” said Cristina Pinzon who serves as a spokeswoman for the developers. Like other cities across the country, Newark is experiencing an affordability crisis where many longtime residents are at risk of being displaced due to gentrification.

News about Queen Latifah’s plans comes nearly a month after NFL star Marshawn Lynch shared that he was going to purchase real estate in his hometown of Oakland so that people who have lived in the community for decades wouldn’t be pushed out.

The article accused Kelly of running an “abusive cult.” In a May statement to The Post, Kelly’s management said the singer “has close friendships with a number of women who are strong, independent, happy, well cared for and free to come and go as they please.""

Lyke, who presided over Kelly’s bond hearing, is the same judge who on Thursday set “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s bond at $100,000. Smollett is charged with felony disorderly conduct and accused of filing a false police report.

This was Kelly’s first court appearance since his arrest Friday. As of Friday, his arraignment is scheduled for March 8."

Cook County state’s attorney Kim Foxx says the alleged abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct.

The 52-year-old Grammy winner’s lawyer said Friday that he was confident Kelly would be vindicated.

Judge Fitzgerald Lyke Jr said during Saturday’s hearing that the bail amount equalled 250,000 dollars for each of the four people he is charged with sexually abusing.

He called the allegations against Kelly “disturbing” during the hearing.

Kelly had spent the night in jail before being taken to the court.

He stood with his hands behind his back and said to the judge: “How are you?”

Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said his client was not a flight risk and told the judge: “Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn’t like to fly.”

The bail requires Kelly to post 100,000 dollars (£76,000) to be released.

A prosecutor told the judge that Kelly met one of the four accusers at his 2008 trial on child pornography charges.

The two met when he gave her an autograph, and the alleged abuse occurred between 2009 and 2010.

The accuser gave law enforcement a shirt that had Kelly’s DNA on it, the prosecutor said.

Kelly has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

After the hearing, Greenberg told reporters that he thought all four of the accusers were lying.

“He did not force anyone to have sex. He’s a rock star. He doesn’t have to have non-consensual sex,” Greenberg said.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti said it was “outrageous” that R Kelly’s lawyer asserted that the four accusers were lying about being sexually abused by the singer.

Avenatti, who said he represents two alleged Kelly victims and said he gave gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said on Saturday that “We’re going to do everything in our power to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008”.

He was referring to Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial."

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse because—in fired FBI Director James Comey’s formulation—a “higher duty” than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Or—in fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s words—“the threat” was too great. Nevermind that the nature of “the threat” was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offenders—and OffensesThe extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureau’s ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as “an insurance policy” against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming president’s reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

The Canadian peer blamed the Justice Department and the FBI, then led by James Comey (pictured) of interfering in the election

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students’ treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public AttentionThe special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the “high crimes and misdemeanors” required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the president’s enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his “higher duty,” lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s (pictured) supporters, Black wrote

And now we have Andrew McCabe’s proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the PollsThis entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsel’s inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the election’s result.

Law enforcement sources who spoke to TMZ said that the matter of who sent the letter is still under investigation.

Authorities have searched the apartment of Abel and Ola Osundairo, Smollett's alleged accomplices in what police are claiming was a staged hate crime. The gossip website says that they seized magazines in the raid and are determining if the lettering in the threatening note came from the publications in their apartment. However, that connection hasn't been made just yet by investigators looking into Smollett's increasingly strange case. The claims of the anonymous officials speaking to TMZ run counter to the words of CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson. The top cop said that Smollett's connection to the letter was determined.

""I think he [Johnson] went too far. We're not there yet,"" the unnamed official said.

Beyond the letter statements, Johnson said that Smollett owes Chicago an apology for using it as the backdrop of his alleged hoax.

“I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it’s been for our city and our nation to come together. And I also know the disparities and I know the history,” Johnson said in a press conference earlier this week. “I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all.

At the hearing, a prosecutor told the judge that Kelly met one of the four victims during his 2008 trial for child pornography, which stemmed from a video that allegedly showed Kelly having sex with and urinating on an underage girl.

A judge in the US has set R Kelly's bail at $1m (£766,500) after the singer was charged with sexually abusing four females, including three minors.

The R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced decades of sexual abuse claims.

He has never been convicted and has previously denied other allegations.

He turned himself in on Friday after an arrest warrant was issued. Even though bail was set at $1m, he will have to post $100,000 to secure his release.

He has been ordered to surrender his passport and to have no contact with anyone under the age of 18.

The 52-year-old's court appearance comes just weeks after a documentary series called Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained decades of allegations of abuse against him from many women, including the singer's ex-wife.

The judge chairing Saturday's hearing was John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, who presided over last week's bail hearing for actor Jussie Smollett.

The actor is accused of staging a hoax hate crime against himself.

What are the allegations?

Image copyright EPA Image caption Chicago Police released an image of the singer after his arrest

Kelly appeared in court on Saturday afternoon and faces 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Prosecutors said that one of the cases relates to footage showing Kelly engaging in sex with a 14-year-old girl, according to the Associated Press. Kelly was previously acquitted over another video tape of a similar nature in 2008.

Kelly met another of the four girls, who was 16 at the time, when she asked for the singer's autograph during the same trial.

Another accuser met Kelly at a restaurant as she celebrated her 16th birthday.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx previously said the singer could face a maximum of seven years in prison for each count.

What is R Kelly's history?

Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about sexual and physical abuse for decades.

In 1994 it was reported he married 15-year-old singer and musical protégé Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago when he was 27. US media said she had lied about her age on the certificate, and the marriage was later annulled.

In 2002 the star was charged with child pornography in Chicago over footage that appeared to show him engaging in intercourse, oral sex, urination, and other sexual acts with a girl said to be 13 or 14.

The case took six years to go to trial. Both Kelly and the girl alleged to be in the video denied it was them. Eventually the jury acquitted Kelly of all 14 charges against him.

In 2017, Kelly was forced to deny allegations that he was holding a number of young women captive in a so-called ""abusive cult"" after a bombshell report from BuzzFeed News.

He has also been sued privately by a number of women, including some who allege underage sexual relationships and another who says he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease.

The singer has continued to make music throughout the allegations.

There have been calls to boycott Kelly's music - both recordings and performances - with people using the social media hashtag #MuteRKelly.

Enter Representative Maxine Waters.

Now before we get to the Marvelous Maxine, Red State writers have been all over this story from the beginning. Here are just some samples.

* Jussie Smollett Tells Cops He Has A Drug Problem.

* The Daily Show Savages Jussie Smollett (No, Really)

* VIDEO: Charles Barkley Can’t Stop Laughing At Jussie Smollett

As you can see this story has so many facets to it that it’s hard to keep up. Luckily though, the interweb is a magical place that stories are there waiting for you when you are ready to read them. That is why this lil nugget of a story about Maxine Waters is just about as fun to read based on her history of being wrong.

Seems that Maxine would be a tad bit disappointed if Jussie were lying. Get out the crying towel.

According to Variety …

Maxine Waters said she “would be disappointed” if it’s proven that her friend Jussie Smollett staged his own attack. Speaking with Variety‘s Marc Malkin on Thursday at Essence’s Black Women in Hollywood Awards, the U.S. representative from California said, “If in fact it’s a hoax, of course I would be disappointed.” Smollett faces one felony count of filing a false police report.

I know you can’t see me right now but my shocked face is in full force being a politician like Waters being disappointed in someone lying. That is only reserved for politicians lying to constituents. What is the world coming too?

This is, of course, a bit of a change from her previous stance when she already knew who was behind the alleged attack of Jussie before the charges last Thursday.

Donald Trump.

From Real Clear Politics …

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said President Trump is responsible for the attack on gay ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett in an interview with ‘The Grio.’ Waters said Trump’s “dog whistling” is “emboldening” people. “It’s coming from the president of the United States. He’s dog whistling every day. He’s separating and dividing, and he’s basically emboldening those folks who feel this way,” Waters said.

So the 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump, while trying to build a wall ALSO was behind two Nigerians hired and paid by check to attack poor Jussie? I can’t wait for the Oliver Stone conspiracy flick to break this all down for me.

However more rational minds might take issue with Maxine’s take here. While Jussie Smollett has the right of innocence until proven guilty, the case laid out by the Cook County prosecutor looks pretty solid. They did not leave a lot to the imagination and it does look bleak for Jussie.

What we are absolutely sure of is that Donald Trump had zero to do with emboldening anyone to commit this attack and he does not have a dog thus he does not have a dog whistle. Maxine is relying on tired talking points that she regurgitates as often as A.O.C. does tide pods. Neither is a really good look.

I hope whoever is in charge of Maxine this week and the months to follow will have her prepared to be disappointed in a way she has not been in while. She rushed to judgment, had her heart broke and now all that is left is coming up with another way to somehow blame Donald Trump.

We can’t wait.

Bill Maher thinks that might not be the worst thing.

Noting that Smollett “wanted to be a victim” but “didn’t want to go through all the steps of being one,” Maher told his panel, “I feel like we’ve gone from this place where now I hear people say, ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed.”

“You’re absolutely right,” Maher’s guest, former Sen. Claire McCaskill chimed in.

“Take you seriously . That’s a big difference, but we seem to have skipped that step because we always do,” he added.

Taking on another point of view, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said, “No one wants to be the victim of hate crimes. No one wants to be the victim of being attacked and brutalized because you’re gay or you’re black or you’re Jewish. That’s bullshit.”

“He wanted a pay raise and he wanted to bring attention to himself,” she continued. “I’m angry with him, I’m upset with him, and he owes not only the city of Chicago an apology—there are real-live victims out there today and I refuse to shut up because he played a terrible game and it’s painful.”

Earlier in the show, during his monologue, Maher predicted—accurately—that Fox News would “dine out” on this story. “Of course Fox News loves this story because it proves their stupid theory that racism is a hoax,” he said."

Kelly is being jailed on 10 counts of sexual abuse against three minors and one adult.

Appearing in court on Saturday facing new sexual abuse charges for the first time, R. Kelly was told that his bail would be set at $1 million. The decision means that Kelly will need to pay $100,000 to be released from jail ahead of his trial, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Judge John Lyke Jr., who also set bail in the case of 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett, reportedly said that if Kelly produced the money, he would need to surrender his passport to prevent him from fleeing the country, and forbade him from communicating with minors. Kelly is accused of the sexual abuse of three individuals who were under the age of 17.

Kelly reportedly frowned at the judgment and was ordered to next appear in court on Monday. He's been housed in the Cook County Jail since Friday night, where he surrendered himself for arrest following the announcement of the 10 charges against him.

Authorities alleged two Nigerian brothers helped Smollett carry out the hoax.

But on Saturday, a new theory surfaced alleging reality is not what law enforcement say it is.

What is the new theory?

Chicago Police said Thursday that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers — Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, and Abimbola Osundairo, 25 — $3,500 each for their help in carrying out the fake attack. Authorities said Smollett paid the brothers with checks.

But TMZ reported Saturday that ""sources connected to the case"" say the money Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers was not for the alleged fake attack. Instead, Smollett paid the brothers to help train him in the gym.

From TMZ:

Our sources say the brothers made a deal with Jussie to train him for 5 weeks so he could get in shape for an upcoming music video. Jussie had said to Ola that he wanted abs like his. Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a 5-week nutrition plan.



Our sources say Jussie told the brothers he would pay them for their services, but no specific amount was discussed.



According to TMZ, even the check's memo line read, ""5 weeks training nutrition plan.""

In fact, TMZ reported the Osundairo brothers told a grand jury Smollett's money was related to his training program, not a staged attack, although sources told TMZ the brothers thought Smollett's payment for the training was ""a little high.""



Additionally, TMZ claimed the Osundairo brothers told the grand jury they were not involved in the sending of a racist letter that Smollett received a week prior to the alleged attack.

A prosecutor told the judge at R. Kelly’s bond hearing in Chicago that the singer met one of the four people he’s charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial.

The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.

Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.

The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.

Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Prosecutors say that three accusers were under between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time of the offenses, and Kelly was more than five years older.

Kim Foxx, State’s Attorney for Cook Count, has said that Kelly is accused of incidents involving another accuser, identified as H.W., from May 26, 1998 to May 25, 1999. Those accusations resulted in an indictment on four counts.

According to Foxx, Kelly is accused of an incident with a second accuser, identified as R.L., between Sept. 26, 1998 and Sept. 25, 2001. Those accusations resulted in an indictment on two counts.

In the instance of a fourth accuser, identified by Foxx as L.C., an indictment on one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse was handed down based on transmission of semen on the body of the accuser for the purpose of sexual gratification. That incident, the prosecution said, occurred on Feb. 18, 2003.

The charge of aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony, Foxx said, carrying a sentencing range of three to seven years per count.

Kelly, 52, surrendered to police at 8:15 p.m. Friday night, hours after being charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Greenberg said earlier in the day that the singer had been ""shell-shocked"" by the charges. He told The Associated Press that his client is ""extraordinarily disappointed and depressed"" about the charges.

Avenatti held a press conference in Chicago Friday where he declared, ""This marks a watershed moment in the 25 years of abuse by this predator known as R. Kelly.""

Avenatti also said he has discovered another video and is in the process of recovering a third video and plans to turn them over to Foxx's office as well.

Attorney Gloria Allred, who says she represents multiple women who have accused Kelly of sexual misconduct, introduced two new accusers at a New York press conference Thursday. The women said they were teens when Kelly plied them with alcohol and marijuana during a mid-'90s Baltimore hotel room encounter that they say ended with the statutory rape of one of them.

""As I predicted yesterday, the wheels of justice are turning,"" Allred said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY on Friday. ""This may not be the only prosecution of Mr. Kelly, because we are aware of other open investigations in other jurisdictions, but I am very glad that he has been indicted in Cook County and that this day has finally come for Mr. Kelly.""

Kelly (all times local):

3 p.m.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it’s “outrageous” that R. Kelly’s attorney questions whether the singer’s accusers are telling the truth about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.

Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, “We’re going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.”

He was referring to Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.

Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly’s bond at $1 million that Kelly “is a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”

Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct, but he has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

R Kelly 's bail has been set at $1 million following his arrest on sex abuse charges.

The singer, 52, appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star's bail at $1 million.

It was the same judge who oversaw Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week when the actor - accused of filing a false police report - was released on £76,693 bail.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

Kelly's hearing came a day after he handed himself in to police to face 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

R Kelly handed himself in to the authorities after being charged with aggravated sexual abuse against four alleged victims.

The singer left his apartment surrounded by members of his entourage and flanked by security guards.

He was driven to the station in a dark-coloured van with heavily-tinted rear windows.

The vehicle pulled up outside the precinct about 8.15pm and a security detail for Kelly kept reporters and cameramen at arms' length as he exited the side door.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a short time later that R Kelly was under arrest.

R Kelly had previously said he was ""shell-shocked"" by the charges and was looking forward to clearing his name in court.

The 52-year-old star was charged in a 10-count Cook County Circuit Court indictment handed down two months after the debut of a six-hour documentary series on the Lifetime television network in which multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct and abuse.

The R&B superstar's attorney Steven Greenberg earlier in the evening tweeted that Kelly would be turning himself in to Chicago police before midnight.

Greenberg previously said the Lifetime series was a ""complete fabrication"" and that there was no evidence to support the allegations against his client.

At a news conference on Friday after the charges were detailed in a court filing, the Cook County state's attorney, Kimberly Foxx, said three of the four victims Kelly is accused of sexually abusing between 1998 and 2010 were under age 17 at the time of the assaults.

Later on Friday, attorney Michael Avenatti, who has represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a legal battle with President Donald Trump, told a separate news conference he has been retained by two people who he said were victims, as well as two parents and two ""whistleblowers"" from Kelly's inner circle.

Avenatti said his firm had uncovered a 40-minute videotape shot in the late 1990s allegedly showing Kelly performing sexual acts with a 14-year-old girl.

Avenatti said he had given the tape to prosecutors.

Chicago prosecutors have not said if that footage was part of their case against Kelly.

Kelly’s bail at $1 million as the singer faced a courtroom for the first time Saturday after he was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Judge John Lyke Jr., who oversaw the bail hearing for Empire actor Jussie Smollett earlier in the week, set the $1 million bail, or $250,000 for each of the four women involved in the charges against Kelly. The singer needs to put up $100,000 to bond out prior to his trial.

Kelly’s lawyer Steven Greenberg argued for a lower bail, stating that his client was having financial difficulties, CNN reported. Kelly was also ordered to give up his passport; “Contrary to the song, he doesn’t like to fly,” Greenberg said, making an “I Believe I Can Fly” joke. Kelly and his associates were also told to have no contact with the alleged victims, while Kelly must only have relations with women 18 years and older.

“He’s going to be vindicated on all of these charges,” Greenberg said. “One by one, if it has to be.”

In the indictment against Kelly obtained by Rolling Stone, the singer has been accused of “sexual penetration” of multiple women “at least 13 years of age but under 17 years of age.” The age of consent in Illinois is 17 years old.

At a press conference Friday, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx detailed the charges against Kelly: Four charges stem from Kelly’s alleged incidents with an underage girl initialed “H.W.” between May 1998 and May 1999. Two counts were drawn from “R.L.,” who, while underage, had sexual encounters with Kelly between September 1998 to September 2001. The most recent counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, from May 2009 to January 2010, are “J.P.,” who was also underage.

“L.C.” is the fourth victim and the one count of sexual abuse stems from a February 18th, 2003 incident, with Kelly accused of “transmission of semen on any part of the victim’s body for sexual gratification.”

Foxx further elaborated on the details of the case against Kelly in a press conference that followed the bail hearing Saturday.

Here are the factual allegations against #RKelly read in court: pic.twitter.com/6Wge8DjYhM — Jason Meisner (@jmetr22b) February 23, 2019

In the case of “L.C.,” “The victim was 24 years old and worked as a hairdresser for Robert Kelly,” Foxx said. “While the victim was waiting alone in a room waiting for Robert Kelly so she could braid his hair, Robert Kelly entered saying he didn’t want his hair braided that day. He wanted his head massaged. At the time he said this, he had his pants pulled down and he was pointing to his penis. Robert Kelly grabbed the victim by the head and tried to force her mouth onto his exposed penis, but the victim was able to resist. Robert Kelly then masturbated and ejaculated onto the victim and spit in her face several times. The shirt the victim was wearing was submitted to the Illinois state police for DNA testing, and the semen was identified on the shirt.”

Foxx also discussed the sex tape allegedly showing Kelly having a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl initialed “R.L.” “In the video, the victim repeatedly, repeatedly says she is 14 years old and Robert Kelly is seen penetrating the victim orally and vaginally,” Foxx said.

Another victim, “H.W.,” was celebrating her 16th birthday when she first encountered Kelly at restaurant; the two allegedly had a year-long sexual relationship from May 1998 to May 1999. Another 16-year-old victim, “J.P.,” provided authorities with a shirt that had semen on it, with the woman claiming it was Kelly’s. The victim also alleged that Kelly would often slap, choke and spit on her."

Kelly was arrested on charges of alleged sexual assault this week, but a Cook County judge found the R&B singer in contempt of court earlier this month for failing to pay back child support to his ex-wife and gave him a March 6 deadline to satisfy the debt.

According to TMZ, Kelly owes ex-wife, Drea Kelly, $194,045 in back child support, interest, education, and health care costs, which were broken down in court documents as $20,833 per month, as of January 2009. The singer has reportedly gotten off schedule in the past year.

The court set the March deadline for Kelly to rectify the matter or face getting locked up in County Jail.

Kelly has been estranged from his three kids – something that he blames on his ex-wife. TMZ sources tell the news outlet that Kelly loves and misses his kids, but has no relationship with them and hasn’t seen them in a while.

Still, sources close to R. Kelly tell TMZ that he is not upset with his daughter Joann Lee Kelly for breaking her silence and calling him a “monster,” in an interview following the release of the Surviving R. Kelly docuseries, because he thinks his daughter and other kids are being brainwashed by Drea to hate him.

Drea added to TMZ that she’s now open to Kelly reaching out to the kids because they’re all adults now and free to make their own choices."

The CNN host announced he would “link two of the hottest stories in the country, Robert Kraft and Jussie Smollett” in the Saturday broadcast of “Smerconish,” referring to the report of the billionaire businessman being charged in Florida in a human trafficking investigation.

Arguing in defense of Kraft, Smerconish called for prostitution to be legalized while he blasted the extent of Kraft’s arrest, calling it the “largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett,” referring to the “Empire” actor who led Chicago police on a hunt for weeks in an alleged hate-crime attack that he has now been charged with staging himself.

“News reports have all the elements, sex, money, stakeout, allegedly even videotape,” the CNN host said Saturday.

“My take, legalize it. In a world where men and women swipe right for companionship and send nude selfies before showing off the real thing, surely an exchange of money for sex between consenting adults is not an absurd suggestion,” he contended. “Like pot, prostitution should be legal, cleaned up, regulated. Healthy.”

“Let me be clear, of course, no woman should be forced into this line of work and anyone who would attempt to make them indentured servants should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he clarified. “But not a 77-year-old guy who lost his wife of 48 years back in 2011. As it is, I tweeted, it represents the largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett.”

In a tweet on Saturday morning, Smerconish asked “Does 77 year old Bob Kraft deserve this for misdemeanor arrest?” along with a photo of the Daily News cover declaring, “KRAFT AMERICAN SLEAZE.”

Does 77 year old Bob Kraft deserve this for misdemeanor arrest? I’ll argue “no” @cnn 9am pic.twitter.com/eHFCVNqLRl — Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) February 23, 2019

He responded later in the show to a tweet by someone saying, “I can’t believe @smerconish is defending Bob Kraft as an unwitting perp in a sex trafficking ring. Kraft chose those girls because he knows they’re voiceless and powerless.”

“How do you know they’re voiceless and powerless?” Smerconish fired back. “How do you know they don’t choose that life? Look, I said very clearly at the outset of the program that if this is a case of indentured servitude, then those who put those women in that path, their employers, need to be held accountable to the highest extent of the law.”

“Does he deserve this? Seriously, does he deserve this?” he asked, holding up the Daily News cover.

“Ban Bob? For a misdemeanor? 77-year-old guy who was looking for some short-term companionship?” he asked, citing a “BAN BOB” headline.

“We should ban him? That’s ridiculous,” he added. “And what a waste of law enforcement resources. No greater waste of law enforcement resources except Jussie Smollett’s hoax. Alleged hoax.”"

Actor Jussie Smollett reportedly told police officers that he has a drug problem after surrendering on Feb. 21 on the charge of filing a false police report.

According to the police, Smollett orchestrated a fake attack against him, hiring two Nigerian-American brothers to pretend to be white President Donald Trump-supporting racists, including having one yell “MAGA,” police said.

After his arrest, the 36-year-old “Empire” actor told police officers that he has a drug problem and that he’s never been treated for it, reported TMZ. However, in court documents, Smollett answered “no” when asked if he had alcohol or mental problems.

Abel and Ola Osundairo were identified as the brothers who Smollett allegedly hired, paying $3,500 to them for the fake attack.

In charging documents, prosecutors said that Smollett was close friends with Abel, 25, after meeting in the fall of 2017. During that time, they worked together on “Empire,” socialized outside of work, and worked out together. In one statement Smollett’s team issued, it said the actor hired Abel at one point as his personal trainer.

Text messages obtained by detectives showed that Abel “was a source of designer drugs” for Smollett, prosecutors said.

“Specifically, since the spring of 2018, on several occasions, Defendant Smollett requested Abel to provide him with ‘Molly,’ which is a street name for the narcotic Ecstasy,” they stated.

According to TMZ, Smollett’s alleged untreated drug problems could be a mitigating factor if he’s convicted.

Smollett’s Character Removed From ‘Empire’ Episodes

Smollett’s character will be removed from multiple episodes of “Empire,” executive producers said on Feb. 22.

Twentieth Century Fox Television said in a new statement.

Smollett plays the character of Jamal Lyons on the show.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” Lee Daniels and six other executive producers said in a joint statement released by Twentieth Century Fox Television.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” they added.

Twentieth Century Fox said in a previous statement after Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report on Feb. 21, that executives were “evaluating the situation and considering our options.”

“We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options,” the company added.

Smollett was released on bond later on Thursday and was slated to appear in court on March 14 to enter a plea.

In a press briefing, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that Smollett’s motivation was frustration with his pay.

“This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” he said. “Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Smollett has not spoken publicly since the brothers were interviewed by police but has maintained his innocence through his legal team."

“When you have two young men who are giving you a statement and you can go back and corroborate that statement with all that evidence you just mentioned, in addition to the documentary evidence and the electronic evidence, you’ve got video evidence. You can actually see them moving around, going to the places. That’s very, very powerful to a jury,” Davis said Friday on “America’s Newsroom.”

“And so what you find is that, in this system a defense attorney will attack the only people that they can attack, which is the accusers — the police. And that’s playing itself out. But we’re very used to that and there’s enough evidence here to move forward, without a doubt.”

Davis also said defense attorneys are inclined to attack the process when the facts are no longer on their side.

“When defense attorneys don’t have any facts, they go to process. And they’re trying to throw enough smoke up there to establish reasonable doubt in the minds of the perspective jurors. That’s what this is all about,” Davis said earlier in the interview.

Kelly, describing how he repeatedly sought out underage girls for sex, including one he encountered at her 16th birthday party and another who met the R&B star while he was on trial for child pornography.

The accounts emerged as Kelly made his first court appearance since being accused of sexually abusing four people in a case that could produce another #MeToo reckoning for a celebrity.

A judge gave Kelly a chance to go free while awaiting trial, setting bond at $1 million. That means the 52-year-old Grammy winner must post $100,000 to be released or remain behind bars until he is tried on the allegations that date back as far as 1998 and span more than a decade.

The prosecution released four documents — one for each accuser — outlining the basis for the charges.

A 16-year-old girl reported meeting Kelly in 1998 at a restaurant where she was having a birthday party. Kelly’s manager gave her the singer’s business card and suggested she call Kelly. The girl’s mother heard the exchange, took the card and told the manager her daughter was 16. But her daughter later retrieved the card from her purse. She contacted Kelly, who gave her instructions and money that she assumed was for the taxi fare to his studio, where they had sex periodically for a year, the documents said.

Another accuser, also 16, met Kelly at his 2008 trial, where he gave her an autograph. He later invited her to his home in the Chicago suburb of Olympia Fields, where they had sex multiple times, according to the documents, which said he also slapped, choked and spit on her.

In early 2003, a Chicago hairdresser told prosecutors that she thought she was going to braid Kelly’s hair, but he pulled down his pants and instead tried to force her to give him oral sex. The woman, who was 24, was able to pull away, but Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face, the documents said.

Prosecutors also described a witness who had access to videotapes showing Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. The witness turned the tape over to authorities and identified the girl, who repeatedly states her age on the footage, according to the documents.

Kelly’s DNA was found in semen on one of the accuser’s shirts, and semen found on a shirt worn by another was submitted for DNA testing, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. It was not clear when the accusers turned the shirts over to authorities, whether it was shortly after the abuse or more recently.

At the bond hearing, Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, said his client is not a flight risk. He told the judge, “Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn’t like to fly.” One of Kelly’s best-known hits is “I Believe I Can Fly.”

Greenberg said Kelly “really doesn’t have any more money,” suggesting that others had mismanaged his wealth. Still, he said he expected that Kelly would be able to come up with enough money for bail.

The judge called the allegations “disturbing.” The singer-songwriter looked down at the floor as the judge spoke.

After the hearing, Greenberg told reporters that Kelly did not force anyone to have sex.

“He’s a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex,” Greenberg said.

The judge ordered Kelly to surrender his passport, ending his hopes of doing a tour of Europe in April. Kelly defiantly scheduled concerts in Germany and the Netherlands despite the cloud of legal issues looming over him. Greenberg denied that any tour was planned.

The recording artist, whose legal name is Robert Kelly, has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. He was charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse.

Kelly, who was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008, has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. He broke into the R&B scene in 1993 with his first solo album, “12 Play,” which produced such popular sex-themed songs as “Bump N’ Grind” and “Your Body’s Callin’.”

He rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side and has retained a sizable following. Kelly has written numerous hits for himself and other artists, including Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. His collaborators have included Jay-Z and Usher.

The jury in 2008 acquitted Kelly of child pornography charges that centered on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13. He and the young woman allegedly seen with him denied they were in the 27-minute video, even though the picture quality was good and witnesses testified it was them, and she did not take the stand. Kelly could have gotten 15 years in prison.

Charging Kelly now for actions that occurred in the same time frame as the allegations from the 2008 trial suggests the accusers are cooperating this time and willing to testify.

Because the alleged victim 10 years ago denied that she was on the video and did not testify, the state’s attorney’s office had little recourse except to charge the lesser offense under Illinois law, child pornography, which required a lower standard of evidence.

Each count of the new charges carries up to seven years in prison, and the sentences could be served consecutively, making it possible for him to receive up to 70 years. Probation is also an option.

The walls began closing in on Kelly after the release of a BBC documentary about him last year and the multipart Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired last month. Together they detailed allegations he was holding women against their will and running a “sex cult.”

#MeToo activists and a social media movement using the hashtag #MuteRKellycalled on streaming services to drop Kelly’s music and promoters not to book any more concerts. Protesters demonstrated outside Kelly’s Chicago studio.

The prosecution said in the indictment that abuse that happened more than two decades ago still falls within the charging window allowed under Illinois law. Victims typically have 20 years to report abuse, beginning when they turn 18.

The singer, real name Robert Kelly, 52, appeared in court in Chicago today after being held by police overnight.

During the brief hearing, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. set the Ignition star's bail at $1 million.

It was the same judge who oversaw Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week when the actor - accused of filing a false police report - was released on £76,693 bail.

He faced the court wearing a black hoodie and kept his hands behind his back throughout the hearing.

The singer is described as showing ""very little emotion"" and kept his eyes fixed on the floor for the majority of his time in court.

The judge described the allegations against Kelly as ""disturbing"" and ordered him not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.

Kelly's attorney reportedly argued that the star is currently broke due to a number of financial setbacks.

Attorney Steven Greenberg is said to have told the judge Kelly has a child support judgement against him that he's unable to pay and he's not making any money.

Greenberg claimed Kelly's earning very little from his music and is not touring.

He also said his client was not a flight risk, telling the judge: ""Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn't like to fly.""

He was referring to Kelly's huge hit single I Believe I Can Fly.

The entertainer faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison if convicted.

Kelly's hearing came a day after he handed himself in to police to face 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The Grammy-winning R&B star, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls for decades.

He has denied any wrongdoing.

R Kelly handed himself in to the authorities after being charged with aggravated sexual abuse against four alleged victims.

The singer left his apartment surrounded by members of his entourage and flanked by security guards.

He was driven to the station in a dark-coloured van with heavily-tinted rear windows.

The vehicle pulled up outside the precinct about 8.15pm and a security detail for Kelly kept reporters and cameramen at arms' length as he exited the side door.

Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a short time later that R Kelly was under arrest.

R Kelly had previously said he was ""shell-shocked"" by the charges and was looking forward to clearing his name in court.

The 52-year-old star was charged in a 10-count Cook County Circuit Court indictment handed down two months after the debut of a six-hour documentary series on the Lifetime television network in which multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct and abuse.

The R&B superstar's attorney Steven Greenberg earlier in the evening tweeted that Kelly would be turning himself in to Chicago police before midnight.

Greenberg previously said the Lifetime series was a ""complete fabrication"" and that there was no evidence to support the allegations against his client.

At a news conference on Friday after the charges were detailed in a court filing, the Cook County state's attorney, Kimberly Foxx, said three of the four victims Kelly is accused of sexually abusing between 1998 and 2010 were under age 17 at the time of the assaults.

Later on Friday, attorney Michael Avenatti, who has represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a legal battle with President Donald Trump, told a separate news conference he has been retained by two people who he said were victims, as well as two parents and two ""whistleblowers"" from Kelly's inner circle.

CHICAGO - The Latest on the sexual abuse case against R&B singer R. Kelly (all times local):

3 p.m.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it's ""outrageous"" that R. Kelly's attorney questions whether the singer's accusers are telling the truth about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.

Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, ""We're going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.""

He was referring to Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.

Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million that Kelly ""is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

Referring to the #MeToo movement, Greenberg said, ""Unfortunately, there's this whole hashtag movement. Just because someone says something now ... it doesn't make them credible.""

2 p.m.

R. Kelly's lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

Greenberg made the comments Saturday after a judge set a $1 million bond for Kelly, who was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four females, including three who were underage at the time.

Greenberg says he's happy with the bond amount, but Kelly doesn't have much money because he says mismanagement by others put the singer in financial straits.

He says Kelly is trying to get the bond money together and hopes to get out of jail later Saturday.

1:40 p.m.

The lawyer for R. Kelly says any sexual contact between the R&B singer and the four people he's charged with sexually abusing might have been consensual..

Steve Greenberg made the comment to reporters Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million. But he says he hasn't seen any evidence yet.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. The 52-year-old Grammy winner's lawyer said Friday that he's confident Kelly will be vindicated.

1:20 p.m.

A prosecutor told the judge at R. Kelly's bond hearing in Chicago that the singer met one of the four people he's charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial.

The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.

Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.

The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.

Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

1:10 p.m.

A judge has set R&B singer R. Kelly's bond at $1 million.

Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. said during Saturday's hearing in Chicago that the amount equals $250,000 for each of the four people he's charged with sexually abusing.

Lyke called the allegations against Kelly ""disturbing"" during the hearing. The singer stared at the floor while the judge was speaking and looked dejected.

R. Kelly's lawyer has asked a judge to release the R&B singer on bond.

Attorney Steve Greenberg told Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. during Saturday's bonding hearing that, ""Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn't like to fly,"" in reference to the Grammy-award winner's hit ""I believe I can fly.""

12:50 p.m.

R. Kelly has arrived at a Chicago court hearing where a judge will decide bond in the sexual abuse case against the R&B singer.

The judge at Saturday's hearing, Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., is the same judge who presided over ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's bond hearing earlier this week.

Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

12:05 a.m.

R&B singer R. Kelly is expected to appear in a Chicago court one day after being arrested and charged with aggravated sexual abuse.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced 10 counts Friday against the Grammy winner. She said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade. The charges involved four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17.

Chicago police say Kelly was taken into custody after the 52-year-old singer surrendered Friday night. He was scheduled to be arraigned Saturday.

Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct, but he has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

The 'Empire' actor - who faces felony charges of filing a false police report and disorderly conduct - turned himself into police, according to authorities

24 February 2019

As reported by Fox News, Chicago police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi confirmed is under arrest after the charges were approved against him on Wednesday (20.02.19).



He has been accused of filing a false report regarding his claims of being the victim of an assault on January 29.



The Cook County State's Attorney's Office approved the charges against him, and he is set to appear in court later on Thursday (21.02.19).



Smollett's attorneys - Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson - told Fox: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.



""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.""



Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox Television - which produces the 'Empire' TV show - and Fox Entertainment have said they have ""no comment at this time"" about Jussie.



Sources told Variety that show chiefs are currently deciding whether to suspend him from the programme but there are currently no plans to change the show's shooting schedule.



Even if the actor does get suspended, sources told the website he is still expected to finish work on the series.



20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment previously denied the star will be written out of his role as Jamal Lyon entirely.



They said in a statement before he was charged: ""Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.""

Why?

Why could be the reason for a famous actor on a network TV show, someone with money, success and fame, pay people to assault him and risk going to jail in the process?

Well, at a press conference in Chicago today, the Police Superintendent was baffled about the whole thing too.

His words, “I’m left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?

An American conservative political commentator, Tucker Carlson, who has being host of political talk show, Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News has had his say as well.

His words, “Well, the short answer appears to be he wanted a raise at work and he thought this would get him that.

The broader answer, the one that we should all think about and meditate on is that Smollett was simply responding to the incentives that American society has created for him.

Smollett pretended to be a victim because we reward victims. We’ve decided that it’s more heroic to suffer than it is to achieve. That’s the message of our culture, our politics, and our workplaces.”

Jussie Smollett was doing his best to get ahead according to the rules that others made. And in fact, had his hoax succeeded, there is no doubt Smollett would have been richly rewarded for it. He would probably get a significant bump in pay and an extended segment on “Colbert.” He would have been a hero.

So Jussie Smollett was not crazy. He knew exactly what he was doing. Faking a hate crime was an entrepreneurial move.

In modern America, victimhood is power that’s why so many powerful people claim it.

That’s why Elizabeth Warren pretended to be an American Indian. It’s why, at every low point during the entire span of his political career, Barack Obama invoked bias. That’s why so many politicians do the same today. “I have suffered, you cannot criticize me.”

The academic left has constructed an entire theology around the holiness of victimhood, it’s called “intersectionality.” It comes with an elaborate ratings system in which every group in America is assessed according to how much it has suffered.

The more your group says it has been discriminated against, the more moral authority you receive. It’s a pretty good deal for a lot of people and they have no interest in changing it, and that explains why so many on the left initially jumped to Jussie Smollett’s defense. They weren’t simply defending him. They were defending identity politics.”"

He recently came out to say Jussie’s side of the story did not make any sense, but after Chicago police dished out a firm condemnation of the actor ad singer as they explained why they believe Smollett staged his own attack, Trevo is even more perplexed.

His words, “Are you kidding me?”

“This dude may have faked a hate crime just to get a raise? I don’t understand—like what’s the logic there? You get your ass beat, and then you go to your boss and be like, ‘Hey, can I get another million dollars? I need to buy some Band-Aids”?

More details by Chicago police and the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office only brought up more confusion like how can anyone acting out a hate crime feel it’s a briliant idea to pay two fake assailants by check?

Furthermore, authorities revealed they used ride-hailing and cell-phone records to put one and two together on what allegedly took place on the night of the incident.

The real news was police’s statement that Jussie hoped his attack would be seen on surveillance photos —but it didn’t happen just because the camera he’d been depending on was facing the wrong direction.

Permit me to Lol here.

Trevor continued, “You’ve got to be shitting me,”

“He wanted to be caught, but he didn’t get caught on-camera because he didn’t know which way the camera was pointing? You’re an actor; that’s your only job!”

As Noah spoke on the case on a radio station, he asserted that the actor “has screwed over everyone.”

“Think about it,”

“Members of the gay community are emotionally terrorized over something that turned out to be a hoax; Trump supporters are upset about being falsely accused; and Democratic candidates are tying themselves into knots, trying to walk back their initial statements calling this a ‘modern-day lynching.’”

“When this started out, it was a story about people who hated Jussie Smollett because he was black and gay. But now people hate him because he’s an asshole. In other words, they’re judging him on the content of his character and not the color of his skin. And that, my friends, is progress.”"

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett’s absurd hate crime claims, few in the “professional” journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone’s a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone’s making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I’m especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC’s “Good Morning America” willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I’ve chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

—Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC’s “Good Morning America,” claiming she found a “degrading” noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried “systematic racism,” and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn’t add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism — until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted “conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner.” Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

—University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a “racist display” of three “noose-like objects” hanging from trees. The UD president called it “deplorable;” protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the “nooses” were metal “remnants of paper lanterns” hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

—Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school’s library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

—Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the “noose” was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who “may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots.”

—Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. “A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America,” the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the “noose” was a “packaged leather shoelace” that someone had dropped accidentally.

—Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of “nooses” lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the “latest in a string of hate incidents” after Trump’s election. The African-American museum director called them a “reminder of America’s dark history.” But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

—Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and “hate signs” found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett’s folly, media sensationalists bluster that there’s no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn’t take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

A statement jointly released Friday by the executive producers of the show, Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Gazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer confirmed the decision to remove the role.

The executive producers of the show said the decision was to prevent further disruption on set.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we’re placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” a part of the statement read.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of “Jamal” from the final two episodes of the season.”

The Empire show is presently in its fifth season.

Jussie Smollett turned himself over to the police after allegedly lying that he was attacked by two persons hurling homophobic and racial slurs.

Kaley Cuoco is gearing up for the last few episodes of The Big Bang Theory, which is coming to the end at the end of the 12th season.

And the 33-year-old – who plays Penny in the series – gave fans a glimpse into the painful way she’s attempting to ‘relax’ before her final scenes, with cupping therapy.

We think we’ll sit this one out…

Taking to her Instagram story, she shared a snap of her back, covered in countless dark circle-shaped bruises.

Alongside the upload, she joked her dog was surprised by the marks.

‘When even your pup is shocked at the amount of cupping you had today,’ she captioned the shot.

The dog isn’t the only one, hun…

Kaley’s photo comes after she revealed she was actually a ‘terrible influence’ on her co-stars backstage, during Big Bang Theory filming.

And we’re not actually that surprised.

She shared a photo of herself, Melissa Rauch (Bernadette) and Mayim Bialik (Amy) on set, looking intently at the camera instead of a show writer.

‘Slowly but surely being a terrible influence on my co stars by teaching them to find the lens instead of listening to our writer who’s trying to give us notes on this scene,’ she joked to her 4.9million followers.

Of course…

However, Kaley’s Instagram recently came under fire after she appeared to delete her supportive message to Empire actor Jussie Smollett.

She previously posted a photo of herself and the cast and crew of the comedy lending their support to the 36-year-old, after he was attacked last month.

But, after he was arrested and accused of orchestrating the attack himself – something he has denied – the picture was removed from Kaley’s social media profile.

And fans rushed to speculate over why it had been taken down so quickly.

‘Are you still standing with Jussie???? You guys where so quick to show support for him (sic),’ one commented beneath a recent post.

‘I guess you guys aren’t “standing” Jussie anymore,’ a follower wrote.

While an Instagram user added: ‘Good to see you guys took down that ridiculous “We stand with #jussiesmollett” post. Now I can get back on the Big Bang bandwagon.’

“Fox News will dine out on this,” Maher noted during his discussion with panellists Donna Brazile, Rick Wilson and Claire McCaskill. “Of course Fox News loves this story because it proves their stupid theory that racism is a hoax.”

Smollett, Maher added, “wanted to be a victim without going through all the steps…”

Brazile, in particular, blasted Smollett. The former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and co-author of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics set forth her theory about Smollett’s alleged hoax.

“He wanted a raise, he wanted a raise, he wanted a raise,” said the clearly angry Brazile.

“No one wants to be a victim of hate crimes, no one wants to be victim of being attacked and brutalized because you’re gay or black or Jewish. That’s bullsh*t,” she added. “He wanted a pay raise and he wanted to bring attention to himself. I’m angry with him. I’m upset with him. He owes not only the city of Chicago an apology, but there are real, live victims out there today, and I refuse to shut up because he played a terrible game, and it’s painful.”

As is usually the case, Maher landed the final word. “I saw Jussie’s interview with Robin Roberts,” the host said of the actor’s “Good Morning America” appearance, “and he’s not a good actor.”

Maher also took a shot at Smollett during his opening monologue. “But you know, Jussie he wanted to raise his profile so he allegedly paid two men $3,500 to assault him for being gay and black — something he could have gotten for free in Texas,” he quipped.

CHICAGO -- The Latest on the sexual abuse case against R&B singer R. Kelly (all times local):

3 p.m.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it's ""outrageous"" that R. Kelly's attorney questions whether the singer's accusers are telling the truth about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.

Avenatti, who says he represents two Kelly victims and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, ""We're going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.""

He was referring to Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.

Kelly's lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly's bond at $1 million that Kelly ""is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

Referring to the #MeToo movement, Greenberg said, ""Unfortunately, there's this whole hashtag movement. Just because someone says something now ... it doesn't make them credible.""

R. Kelly's lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: ""He is a rock star. He doesn't have to have nonconsensual sex.""

BILL MAHER ON JUSSIE SMOLLETT: VICTIMS SHOULDN'T ALWAYS BE BELIEVED, THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

Chicago police charged Smollett Thursday with filing a false report for allegedly staging a Jan. 29 attack on himself and making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him last month. He said they threw bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and said it was ""MAGA"" country, referring to President Trump's supporters, during the assault.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the tv star calling the Smollett saga ""simply shameful.""

Smollett has denied making up the attack.

The aldermen said the Smollett case should ""serve as an example of how rushing to judgment without proper facts and investigation can hurt all of us.""

""If our city is to heal, we need to not be so quick to rush to judgment, let the police do their jobs and begin treating each other with respect and dignity,"" they said. ""Are you listening, Mr. Smollett?""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., were some of the high-profile politicians who spoke out on behalf of Smollett after the attack was first made public.

Among celebrities who spoke out, director Rob Reiner initially tweeted: ""The horrific attack on Jussie Smollett has no place in a decent human loving society. Homophobia existed before Trump, but there is no question that since he has injected his hatred into the American bloodstream, we are less decent, less human, & less loving. No intolerance! No DT!”

Reiner has deleted his tweet.

On Jan. 29, actor Billy Eichner tweeted that Trump and ""all MAGA lunatics"" should ""burn in hell."" He, too, has deleted the tweet.

Singer Katy Perry tweeted on Jan. 29: ""Standing with and sending love to @JussieSmollett today… this is a racist hate crime and is disgusting and shameful to our country.”

Actress Olivia Munn also weighed in, tweeting, “Jussie Smollett was violently attacked by two white men who poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck. He was targeted for being black and for being gay. THIS is why we have to have zero tolerance against homophobia and racism. Jussie’s life matters.”"

The judge at Saturday’s hearing, Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., is the same judge who presided over “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s bond hearing earlier this week.

Kelly was booked Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four female victims, including three who were between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. The 52-year-old Grammy winner’s lawyer said Friday that he’s confident Kelly will be vindicated.

R&B singer R. Kelly is expected to appear in a Chicago court one day after being arrested and charged with aggravated sexual abuse.

Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced 10 counts Friday against the Grammy winner. She said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade. The charges involved four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17.

Chicago police say Kelly was taken into custody after the 52-year-old singer surrendered Friday night. He was scheduled to be arraigned Saturday.

Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct, but he has been dogged for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves.

Either way, they are being called out by none other than first son Donald Trump, Jr.

Whether you are a Donald Two fan or not, the man has a point. In a commentary on RealClearPolitics.com, the president’s son submits his case that the lefty censors are getting mighty heavy-handed. One thing the son may have learned from his father is not to permit himself to be pushed around:

“Anti-conservative censorship online has gone from bad to worse. As major social media platforms start to target me for censorship, I shudder to think what that means for millions of other Americans, especially as we approach the 2020 presidential campaign.”

This time it was Instagram that drew the penalty flag. Apparently, Don Jr. took to the photographic social media site to comment on the disintegrating Jussie Smollett story, when he received a “post deleted” notice. In a classic Trumpian push back, Don Jr. complained that the move was “blatant censorship.” He then opined, “Conservatives soon let me know by direct message that Instagram was preventing them from following my account, or even sharing or liking any of my posts.”

Yet Another “Error”

Instagram then did what has become all too common – they claimed the deleted post was a “mistake.” This familiar refrain is becoming a tired and overused mantra that is less believable by the day, and Instagram is hardly an isolated perpetrator. But of course, Facebook owns Instagram, so it’s six of one, half a dozen of another. Everyone knows the sagas of Alex Jones and journalist Laura Loomer, not to mention when Twitter was caught in flagrante trying to censor Candace Owens.

The best thing one can say about all this digital book burning is that at least conservatives are willing to speak up and hit back. Even when the AI anti-conservative settings are in the stratosphere there is often very little one can do about it. Sure, Owens, Trump, Jr., and Jones have big names to fall back on – but what about Joe Six Pack who is inexplicably shut down? Do you think the Big Boys in Menlo Park would be as likely to issue a “heartfelt” apology to the average citizen like the one that was granted to Donald, Jr.?

Ah, that’s probably a gray area, as in very gray.

Take for instance Liberty Nation’s Political Correspondent Graham Noble. He’s been banned from Twitter for “hate speech” for several months now. “I have little doubt that the ban was more generally aimed at my political opinions than a single tweet,” says Noble. Thus far, no apology appears to be forthcoming.

Time to Grow Up

Could it be that this is a simple case of the fish rotting from the head down? After all, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a very long “history of apologizing for the company’s mistakes and promising to do better.” And that’s a quote from The New York Times. Zuckerberg has an extensive history of what appear to be hollow apologies. “So we have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,” he told Congress. “I think it’s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we’re at now without making some mistakes.”

Perhaps it’s time to give Zuckerberg and friends a lesson in adulthood. Growing up includes taking responsibility for one’s actions. Donald Trump, Jr. is right to call out Instagram, and those who run social media’s virtual monopolies would be wise to tamp down their protests of ignorance and loosen up their electronic censorship of conservatives. Should they be able to hold two thoughts in their heads at the same time, another lesson of maturity is knowing that when you take a cheap shot, you are bound to get a broadside hit on the next play."

The Osundairo brothers also told the grand jury this week that they had nothing to do with the threatening letter that was sent to Smollett eight days before the “attack.”

The Chicago Police claim that the $3500 Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers was to fake an attack on him. Smollett is being charged with federal disorderly conduct for filing a false report, a class four felony.

The cast of Empire thinks Smollett got the idea to fake an attack on him after hearing Empire creator Lee Daniels talk about how his cousin was attacked for being gay in a January 10th Instagram post, according to TMZ. Daniels also shared more details on the story on the set of the show.

According to TMZ, sources close to the Empire production said cast members think Jussie began concocting his plan days after Lee posted a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia. In that IG post, Lee, who created the hit drama, Empire, wrote that “this past week my cousin was beaten up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories.”

—Bennett College granted temporary accreditation while legal challenge persists—

TMZ sources say Lee then showed up to the set and shared more about his cousin’s attack, which was met with cast members becoming visibly upset that Lee’s family had been victimized in such a brutal incident. Sources tell TMZ that this might have been the catalyst that gave Smollett the idea to begin plotting to take matters into his own hands.

According to the Chicago Police Department Superintendent, Jussie’s motive was money. He allegedly felt he was underpaid based on the salaries of his other cast mates on the show.

But things started to fall apart when two Nigerian brothers told police that Smollett hired them to beat him, douse him with bleach, yell racist and homophobic slurs and to put a noose around his neck. This week, Jussie was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report and faces up to three years in jail.

Last week, sources told Deadline that Smollett has been canceled from future episodes of Empire. The show returns on March 13 for the remainder of its fifth season."

Kelly as a predator who for more than two decades used his fame to prey on young women and girls — including one girl the singer allegedly met during his 2008 child pornography trial.

Kelly appeared at the Leighton Criminal Court Building — the same courthouse in which he was acquitted of the child pornography charges — wearing a black hoodie and jeans, and a frown that creased his face.

Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. called the charges presented by prosecutors “disturbing” as he set Kelly’s bail at $1 million during the artist’s first court appearance since turning himself in to Chicago police late Friday.

Kelly failed to pay the $100,000 needed for his release ahead of trial on Saturday night, but could post bond Sunday after spending a second night in custody.

Kelly’s defense attorney, Steven Greenberg, said the singer’s finances were “a mess” and his income strangled after his record label dropped him. Greenberg said he expected Kelly to have the cash to bond out of jail before his next court appearance on Monday.

“He’s trying to get it together,” Greenberg told reporters after the hearing.

Kelly owes upward of $160,000 in back child support and was about to be evicted from his Near West Side studio after failing to pay $167,000 in rent, Greenberg said.

If Kelly posts the money, Lyke ordered the 52-year-old singer to surrender his passport and any weapons, and to have no contact with anyone under 18 or the alleged victims or witnesses in the case.

Greenberg told Lyke he already secured Kelly’s passport, which the singer has not used since it was issued in 2017.

“In fact, Mr. Kelly doesn’t like — contrary to the song — he doesn’t like to fly,” Greenberg quipped in court, referring to the singer’s hit song “I Believe I Can Fly.”

Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, stared at the ground as Assistant State’s Attorney Jennifer Gonzalez read off a proffer of the evidence against him in four separate cases — each involving a different victim — consisting of 10 counts of alleged sexual abuse that took place between 1998 and 2010.

The first case Gonzalez outlined took place in 2003, with the victim identified as a 24-year-old hairdresser who went to Kelly’s Near North Side studio to braid his hair. When she arrived, Kelly walked in with his pants down and said he didn’t want his hair braided, but his “head massaged,” and pointed to his penis, Gonzalez said.

Kelly then tried to force the hair dresser, identified in court records by the initials L.C., to give him oral sex. Kelly masturbated and ejaculated on the victim, and spit on her, Gonzalez said. Her shirt was taken for DNA analysis and was a match for Kelly.

The second case, comprising four counts of sexual abuse, involved a girl who said she met Kelly at her 16th birthday party. An associate of the singer allegedly passed the girl a card with Kelly’s personal number on it and asked her to call Kelly.

The girl’s mother told Kelly’s associate that the girl was only 16, and took the card. The girl later found the card in her mother’s purse, called Kelly and took a cab to his studio, where the two had sex, Gonzalez said. Afterward, Kelly allegedly told her to get an envelope of cash from a receptionist, money the girl assumed was for her cab fare.

“The envelope contained a large sum of money, more than was needed to pay for two cab rides,” Gonzalez said.

The third victim, “J.P.”, met Kelly when she got his autograph as the singer headed into court during his 2008 trial. She was invited to the singer’s Olympia Fields mansion, beginning a sexual relationship that spanned from May 2009 through January 2010, according to Gonzalez, who said the victim provided a shirt with semen on it that a preliminary test matched to Kelly’s DNA.

That story was identical to the account of a relationship Jerhonda Pace gave in the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary. Pace, who said in the documentary she was 16 the first time she had sex with Kelly, was in the courtroom gallery Saturday.

The fourth victim, whom Kelly’s lawyer surmised was the same victim in Kelly’s 2008 trial, was allegedly filmed having sex with Kelly on a videotape obtained by a “witness” who was asked in 2001 by Kelly and his associates to locate sex tapes of the singer. The victim, “R.L.”, was identified on the tape by her aunt, Gonzalez said, which showed the pair having sex and the victim repeatedly saying she is 14 years old.

Notably, prosecutors said the videotape referenced in the current charges was not the same one presented as evidence in Kelly’s 2008 trial.

Former Cook County prosecutor James McKay said the state’s proffer would appear to offer up a strong case against Kelly, perhaps stronger than the case for which Kelly was acquitted in 2008.

“If that’s Kelly’s DNA on any of those crimes, that’s as good as gold, especially if you’ve got victims who will cooperate with the prosecution,” McKay said, noting that neither the victim, nor her parents, cooperated with prosecutors in Kelly’s child pornography case.

“The statute of limitations for these kinds of crimes was extended precisely because a child sex victim may not come forward in a timely manner,” McKay said.

Read the full bond proffer presented by Cook County prosecutors against R. Kelly:

Among Kelly’s supporters seated in the court gallery were Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage — the two women living with the singer whose parents have claimed are being held against their will. Clary’s parents have said they have had little to no contact with their daughter in the past three years.

Both women were initially seated one row in front of Clary’s father, but later moved up a row and ignored his attempt to speak with his daughter.

Speaking to the media after the hearing, high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti, who sat during the hearing with Clary’s family, claimed Clary was “shielded” from Angelo and Alice Clary by Kelly’s associates.

“Their daughter has been brainwashed by Mr. Kelly and his handlers,” Avenatti said. “I think it’s disgraceful that Mr. Kelly came here today — had his enablers and his handlers come here today — with an eye towards keeping their daughter from them.

“They brought them here in an effort to send a message that all is well with Robert Kelly and there is nothing untoward about his conduct,” added Avenatti, who has said he located and handed to prosecutors the VHS tape that provided evidence in one of the four cases.

Savage and Azriel Clary walked out of the courthouse after the hearing and did not answer reporters’ questions.

Avenatti also rejected a claim by Greenberg that some of the new charges constitute double jeopardy of the earlier child pornography charges.

“The tape at issue does not involve the same acts at issue in the 2008 trial,” Avenatti said. “The basic law of double jeopardy does not prevent Mr. Kelly from being charged for other acts separate and apart from those with which he was charged with in 2008.”

Greenberg, appearing in front of cameras moments after Avenatti, reiterated comments he made Friday night when he claimed all of Kelly’s alleged victims are liars.

“He did not force anyone to have sex,” Greenberg said. “He’s a rock star. He doesn’t have to have non-consensual sex.”

In February, he was arrested in custody and with a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. A day later, Smollett was dropped the producers of Empire for the rest of the show’s fifth season.

Jussie Smollett News

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer in a statement this morning in reference to the supposed assault of January 29 and the events that unfolded after.

“Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the producers added. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The move may at first seem to be a big one but with only a pair of episodes left to be completed, the producers can easily cut and work around Smollett’s scenes. On Thursday after Smollett turned himself in, 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment said they were “evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”

The move can also be interpreted as a stand. Just days ago, the companies described the actor as continuing “to be a consummate professional” and also “core” to the show. Now, they’re distancing themselves.

Like all the original cast, Smollett signed on for seven seasons on the show back in 2014. The original actors pull in around $100,000 per episode. The 36-year-old actor was expected to return for the sixth season however odds of that occurring are shrinking fast."

Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed.” For what it’s worth, Maher didn’t believe Smollett’s story after watching his first on-air interview: “I saw Jussie’s interview with Robin Roberts, and he’s not a good actor.”

Earlier this week, Smollett was charged with making a false police report, which is a felony disorderly conduct charge that could bring jail time and/or monetary fines. He has maintained his innocence, despite prosecutors laying out, in detail, how Smollett staged the attack with the help of two friends. Empire has since cut Smollett from the final two episodes of the season."

But the brothers claim the cash was for them to train him for five weeks after Smollett ""wanted abs like his"", reported TMZ.

Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a five-week nutrition plan, they reportedly say.

A few days before the alleged ""attack"", Smollett paid the two men with the cheque's memo reading ""5 weeks training nutrition plan"".

Earlier this week, Smollett told officers he has a drug problem as they arrested him for allegedly staging the attack to boost his career, according to US reports.

Cops later said the Empire star had bought ecstasy from one of the brothers said to have helped him in the elaborate hoax.

Police charged Smollett on Wednesday with staging the violent attack in Chicago and he handed himself in the next morning.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drug use and had never been treated, TMZ reports.

And police papers say text messages appear to show Smollett asking pal and Empire extra Abel Osundairo for ""Molly"" - a street name for ecstasy.

If he is convicted, a drug problem could be used as a mitigating factor and get his sentence reduced, US reports say.

Police said the actor messaged Abel days before saying: ""Might need your help on the low.""

'DESPICABLE' HOAX

Smollett reportedly headed straight to the Empire TV set from court to plead with cast members after being released on £76,000 bail on Thursday.

Sources told TMZ that Jussie arrived late on the TV series set and then begged his cast mates to believe he did not orchestrate the hoax.

Earlier on Thursday, the actor was told to surrender his passport when he appeared in front of State of Illinois Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr.

The judge called the hate-crime hoax allegations against the star “utterly outrageous,” reports the New York Post.

“The most violent, despicable part of it, if true, is the noose,” he said. “That symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.”

13 Smollett said he received a threatening hate letter warning 'you will die black fag' but cops say he sent it himself

Earlier this week, Smollett was slammed by Chicago's black police chief for ""taking advantage of the pain and anger of racism"" to boost his career and earnings.

The Empire actor could face three years in jail after he was sensationally charged with staging an elaborate street assault so he could play victim.

He has also been accused of sending himself a note containing a cartoon figure strung up by a noose and cut-out letters spelling: ""You will die, black f*g"".

Smollett claimed the note was a threat before two Trump fans in MAGA hats shouted racist and homophobic abuse, beat him up and left him with a rope round his neck.

CCTV BOMBSHELL

President Trump tweeted in response: ""@jussiesmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA""

Cops grew suspicious as holes began to appear in the actor's story following the alleged attack in Chicago last month and a tearful TV interview as he told of his ordeal.

CCTV footage emerged showing two brothers with links to Smollett buying ski masks, bandanas and red hats just a day before the ""attack"".

Smollett was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Empire extras Ola Osundairo, 27, and brother Abel, 25, were allegedly paid more than £3,000 by the actor to attack him.

On Wednesday they appeared before a Grand Jury - which decides whether to bring charges in big cases - for two and a half hours to testify against Smollett.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt later told reporters they laid out how Smollett ""put them up to the fake assault"", TMZ reported.

The shocking twist in the case came just days after A-list celebs flooded social media with their support for the 36-year-old.

Ola — who had worked as an extra on Empire — and Abel were released when officers revealed new evidence had come to light and they were “eager to speak to” Smollett.

The Police has said that the duo of Ola and Abel were paid by the now embattled actor to fake the attack but celebrity site, TMZ, reports that they were paid for a different thing entirely.

The report says the brothers made a deal with Jussie to train him for five weeks so he could get in shape for an upcoming music video. Both Abel and Ola agreed to train Jussie, and also give him a 5-week nutrition plan – but no specific amount was discussed as payment.

The report adds that a few days before the widely reported planned attack, Jussie wrote the brothers a check for $3,500. The memo line read, “5 weeks training nutrition plan.” And so, Ola and Abel were paid for the 5-week program and not for the attack.

Also, the brothers felt the amount was “a little high” but no one ever specifically said anything about any of the money being part of a scheme."

Jussie Smollett told cops he has an untreated drug problem — raising questions about whether he might try to use the claim to at least get any potential prison sentence reduced, according to a report Friday. The “Empire” star divulged his alleged drug problem after turning himself in Thursday morning on charges he filed a false police report involving a hate crime, TMZ reported.

Prosecutors said Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, one of the brothers who helped Smollett allegedly stage the Jan. 29 hate attack, served as Smollett’s drug dealer, selling him Molly several times since the spring of 2018.

The 36-year-old actor, in claiming to have a drug problem, could be paving the way to use it as a “mitigating factor” when it comes to sentencing, the site said. In court documents, Smollett answered “no” to whether he had any mental or alcohol problems."

Conservative news outlets are now routinely publishing pieces that list chronologies of “hate hoaxes.” Websites, bearing names like “fakehatecrimes.org,” are categorizing every perceived incident. A Republican lawmaker in Minnesota said this week he planned to introduce legislation to crack down on false reports of hate crimes, lamenting on Twitter “the recent rise in fake victimization.” And a conservative publishing house will publish a book next week based on the notion that “we’re not experiencing an epidemic of hate crimes … but we might be experiencing an unprecedented epidemic of hate crime hoaxes.”

The nascent culture war over hate crime obfuscates what researchers call the empirical truth of hate crimes: They are rising in America. And exceptionally few are hoaxes.

“What’s been disturbing in the sciences is that we’ve gone from fair-minded professional critiques to downright conspiracy theories,” said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino. “The American public has a right to know [hate crime facts] but there is an orchestrated campaign by political pundits not to only point out limitations in the data — which is appropriate — but to obscure the real information that is out there.”

The number of hate-crime incidents rose 17 percent in 2017, according to the FBI, which doesn’t track the rate of false allegations. Hate crimes have grown in major American cities in each of the last five years, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. The trend has been particularly pronounced in places like Washington, D.C., where the number of hate crimes has nearly doubled since 2016. Since then, according to the center’s preliminary figures, there have been fewer than 50 false reports of a hate crime across America, out of an estimated 21,000 reported hate crimes over that time period — a rate of 0.3 percent.

The FBI categorizes hate crimes as being “motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”

“I’ve been doing this since the 1980s, and we don’t have any indication where lying about this is a widespread phenomenon,” said Jack McDevitt, director of the Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University in Boston.

The tendency to dispute claims of hate crimes — that victims are making it up for attention — has historical roots. There were allegations during the mid-1990s that some burnings of black churches — carried out by young white male racists — were made up, said James Nolan, a hate crime expert with West Virginia University. White supremacist groups have for years called hate crimes faked or described whites as their true victims. But such allegations have accelerated in a media environment where news stations and websites have clear political leanings, social media amplifies every political difference, and accusations of “fake news” and “media hoaxes” are regular and pervasive.

That perception has deepened when high-profile liberals and Democrats have seized on allegations of hate crimes — sometimes to show solidarity with minority communities — which turned out to be untrue or more complicated than originally presented. Before Jussie Smollett, there was a Long Island woman who recanted claims she made to police that teens yelled “Trump 2016,″ told her she “didn’t belong here,” then slashed her tires. And before her, there was an 18-year-old Muslim woman who was charged with filing a false report after she claimed three men attacked her, tried to pull off her hijab and yelled “Donald Trump!”

AD

Those incidents — and the way they reinforce a conservative media narrative of fake hate crimes — could lead large swaths of Americans to doubt hate crime research, experts worry. Such denial is “morphing and becoming more mainstream,” said Peter Simi, a professor at Chapman University who has extensively studied hate in America.

Rising hate crime in the country has, to a certain degree, become a referendum on President Trump, whose election coincided with a spike in hate crimes, research shows. “It is another element in a very profound and pervasive culture war,” said Jack Levin, co-director of Northeastern University’s Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. “Those who voice their concerns about the growing number of hate crimes against a variety of vulnerable groups are seen as anti-Trump. … And some of the pro-Trump detest the idea of hate crimes and refuse to acknowledge the idea that there are certain victimized groups in America who deserve our attention.”

Wilfred Reilly, an associate professor at Kentucky State University and author of a book that will be released next week, “Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is Selling a Fake Race War,” said the left was just as guilty for the polarized debate. “It’s politicization to say there’s a massive surge of hate under our president.” He said liberals often characterize all hate crimes as “attacks on innocent people of color,” when “you don’t know what happened.”

AD

The divisiveness has made political targets out of some researchers charting the rise of hate crime in the country. Brian Levin says he has been accused of being funded by George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, or Nicolás Maduro, the embattled socialist Venezuelan president. He said he often gets phone calls from people angry about what his work has shown — the product, he said, of an “orchestrated attack against truth.” He played one of them for a Washington Post reporter."

Earlier this week, Smollett told officers he has a drug problem as they arrested him for allegedly staging the attack to boost his career, according to US reports.

Cops later said the Empire star had bought ecstasy from one of the brothers said to have helped him in the elaborate hoax.

Police charged Smollett on Wednesday with staging the violent attack in Chicago and he handed himself in the next morning.

During his arrest he reportedly told officers he struggled with drug use and had never been treated, TMZ reports.

And police papers say text messages appear to show Smollett asking pal and Empire extra Abel Osundairo for ""Molly"" - a street name for ecstasy.

If he is convicted, a drug problem could be used as a mitigating factor and get his sentence reduced, US reports say.

Police said the actor messaged Abel days before saying: ""Might need your help on the low.""

'DESPICABLE' HOAX

Smollett reportedly headed straight to the Empire TV set from court to plead with cast members after being released on £76,000 bail on Thursday.

Sources told TMZ that Jussie arrived late on the TV series set and then begged his cast mates to believe he did not orchestrate the hoax.

Earlier on Thursday, the actor was told to surrender his passport when he appeared in front of State of Illinois Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr.

The judge called the hate-crime hoax allegations against the star “utterly outrageous,” reports the New York Post.

“The most violent, despicable part of it, if true, is the noose,” he said. “That symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.”

13 Smollett said he received a threatening hate letter warning 'you will die black fag' but cops say he sent it himself

Earlier this week, Smollett was slammed by Chicago's black police chief for ""taking advantage of the pain and anger of racism"" to boost his career and earnings.

The Empire actor could face three years in jail after he was sensationally charged with staging an elaborate street assault so he could play victim.

He has also been accused of sending himself a note containing a cartoon figure strung up by a noose and cut-out letters spelling: ""You will die, black f*g"".

Smollett claimed the note was a threat before two Trump fans in MAGA hats shouted racist and homophobic abuse, beat him up and left him with a rope round his neck.

President Trump tweeted in response: ""@jussiesmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA""

Cops grew suspicious as holes began to appear in the actor's story following the alleged attack in Chicago last month and a tearful TV interview as he told of his ordeal.

CCTV footage emerged showing two brothers with links to Smollett buying ski masks, bandanas and red hats just a day before the ""attack"".

Smollett was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

Empire extras Ola Osundairo, 27, and brother Abel, 25, were allegedly paid more than £3,000 by the actor to attack him.

On Wednesday they appeared before a Grand Jury - which decides whether to bring charges in big cases - for two and a half hours to testify against Smollett.

The brothers' lawyer Gloria Schmidt later told reporters they laid out how Smollett ""put them up to the fake assault"", TMZ reported.

The shocking twist in the case came just days after A-list celebs flooded social media with their support for the 36-year-old.

Jussie Smollett was arrested amid claims he staged the homophobic and racist attack he said he was a ‘victim’ of, last month.

The Chicago Police Department alleged the Empire actor paid brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo $3,500 (£2,681) to beat him up in Chicago, before putting a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him.

However, an insider has claimed the 36-year-old actually gave the pair money to train him up and get him in shape for an upcoming music video.

Sources reportedly claimed both Ola and Abel told the grand jury they were paid for the programme in question, and not for the ‘attack’ – and also vowed they had nothing to do with a threatening letter that was sent to the Empire set, which included racist and homophobic language.

They told the publication that ‘no one ever specifically said anything about any of the money being part of a scheme’.

Smollett was recently released after posting $100,000 (£77k) bail earlier this week.

He was charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct, after claiming two men attacked him in January, after he landed in Chicago.

Officials have now claimed he staged the whole thing, hiring the Osundairo brothers to carry out the ‘attack’.

Text messages shown in court, allegedly sent between Smollett and the two men, detailed how the actor reportedly gave them $100 (£76) to buy supplies.

Prosecutors claimed Smollett scheduled the attack for 10pm instead of 2am but his flight into O’hare Airport was delayed by four hours.

The state say they corroborated this with a call placed at 12:49am between Smollett and the two men, with the ‘staged’ attack reportedly lasting around 45 seconds.

He has denied all allegations against him.

Following the accusations, Smollett has now been removed from the final episodes of Empire, where he plays Jamal Lyon alongside co-stars Taraji P Henson and Terrence Howard.

Fox confirmed the news in a statement, addressing the ’emotional’ recent events.

‘The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,’ it began.

‘Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

‘While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

‘We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season.’

When reports of the initial attack came out back in January, where Smollett alleged two men yelled racist and homophobic slurs, tied a rope around his neck and poured something on him, rappers like 50 Cent and T.I. immediately came to the defense of Smollett and sent their well-wishes. Now, many are speaking out against him in light of the new details.

50 Cent and Snoop Dogg have both joked about the turn of events via Instagram. Others took a deeper approach.

Following his arrest on Thursday, the judge granted a $100,000 bail. Smollett bonded out for $10,000, and is due back in court on March 14. The actor could be facing one to three years in prison if found guilty of the felony charge of disorderly conduct.

“Jussie Smollett‘s potentially permanent Empire ouster may not mark the end of the road for his character, Jamal Lyon. TVLine has learned that among the options producers are considering is bringing in a new actor to take over the role in Season 6.”

Switching out actors in a specific role is not unheard of in television. Most famously, there was Elizabeth Montgomery’s husband in the sitcom Bewitched; a smooth transition from Dick York in season five to Dick Sargent in season six. More recently, there have been actor switcheroos on Game of Thrones, Roseanne, Arrested Development, and Last Man Standing, among others.

Sometimes the actor gets tired of the role.

Sometimes the actor is not quite right for the role.

Sometimes the actor is hard to get along with.

Sometimes the actor writes a check to two black guys to beat him up so he can blame it on white Trump supporters knowing the national media will not ask any questions and run wild with it.

It seems to me, Fox could easily replace Smollett and should. It would be awkward to write the character out, especially if the studio decides there is no way to bring Jussie Smollett back in any capacity, even to wrap up his character’s story — have him die in a car accident or move to China, or something. On the other hand, the character of Jamal Lyon is central to the series and his abrupt departure could damage the series, so…

Better to find someone else to step into the role, another talented young man, but one who, you know, is not a lying, hate-crime hoaxer willing to start riots if it means a little attention.

Regardless of what happens to the character of Jamal Lyon, Jussie Smollett’s career is almost certainly over. He has already been cut out of the final two episodes of Empire and as the show enters its hiatus, Smollett is facing all kinds of legal jeopardy, including prison time for filing a false police report.

And let’s not forget the possibility of federal mail fraud charges over a piece of hate mail police say Smollett mailed to himself.

At this point, no one can see a way out for Smollett. Public relations experts, people who deal with the worst scandals imaginable, see no daylight.

“I’ve worked on really high-profile crisis issues. I don’t think anybody’s had to work on something like this,” PR expert Ronn Torossian told ABC News. “I think his career as we know it is over… This isn’t just a hoax. This is about a hoax that touches upon race, sex, and politics.”

“I would say that the moral crime committed there and the ramifications it might have on multiple communities is far greater than the potential legal ramifications that he might face,” PR crisis specialist Vlad Drazdovich said, adding, “the damage of unraveling the collective trust of people, millions of people … it might linger for years to come and it may continue longer than the one to three year sentence that he may have to serve.”

“[W]e always encourage our clients to tell the truth because nothing disinfects like sunlight. [Smollett] has had several opportunities to sort of come clean and retract his statements and admit that he lied –- if he in fact lied –- but instead he decided to double down,” he added.

Well, at this point, Smollett has no choice but to continue to claim he’s innocent. The kind of heartfelt confession that might salvage his career could also put him in a jail cell.

Fox has already confirmed that Smollett’s character, Jamal, will be written out of the season’s final two episodes—and new reports suggest that creator __Lee Daniels__may be pursuing a radical option for next season.

TVLine claims that Daniels has become “a strong proponent” for recasting the role of Jamal Lyon, bringing in a new actor to replace Smollett rather than writing Jamal off the show altogether. Empire has not formally been renewed for a sixth season—though Fox is expected to confirm an order before long—and recasting would take place in advance of Season 6 production.

When Smollett’s Empire suspension was announced, executive producers Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer released a statement: “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,” they said. According to TMZ, unnamed members of the Empire cast are “f--king furious” with their co-star’s alleged deception, and Smollett has even reportedly changed phone numbers to curb an influx of messages from some of his colleagues.

Smollett was formally arrested Thursday, and is facing charges of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He has been released from custody after posting a $10,000 bond, and has been ordered to have no contact with either Abimbola “Abel” or Olabinjo “Ola” Osundairo, the brothers Smollett allegedly contracted by personal check to fake the attack. Chicago P.D. Superintendent Eddie Johnson claimed in a press conference that Smollett orchestrated the incident because he was dissatisfied with his Empire salary. Other unnamed sources from the set of Empire speculated to TMZ that Smollett was inspired to act after learning that Lee Daniels’s cousin, who also identifies as gay, was assaulted in January.

Neither Fox nor Empire representatives have commented on the potential plan to find a replacement for Smollett. If they do decide to recast the role, though, they should consider comedian and Daily Show contributor Jaboukie Young-White—who also identifies as gay, and has already jokingly volunteered to portray Smollett in a movie dramatizing Smollett’s ordeal."

In the wake of Jussie Smollett’s arrest for falsifying a police report, the Empire team are considering still keeping his character Jamal in the show, it has been reported.

Jussie, who has been accused of faking a hate crime against himself in order to increase his wage on the show, has had his character’s involvement in the final two episodes removed in the wake of the arrest.

Jamal Lyon is one of the leading family members of the said Empire, and as a result, TVLine is stating that insiders are looking at all their options – including potentially bringing in a new actor.

The character is based in part on the show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, who co-signed the announcement of Jussie’s removal from the upcoming final episodes of season five on Friday.

Metro.co.uk has contacted Fox for comment.

If this happens, then we could see Jamal live on another day on the show – and it must be noted that while the star has been removed from the series, he has not officially been fired from the show as of yet.

Jussie’s claims that he was attacked in Chicago at the beginning of the month has been met with a series of counterclaims from the city’s police department, who state their investigation revealed he paid the two men in question to attack him.

The incident originally appeared to be both homophobic and racist in nature, with the gay actor being ‘covered in bleach’ and ‘dragged across the floor with a noose around his neck’.

However, the men were later released without charge upon new evidence being received.

Jussie has continued to maintain his innocence in the matter, asserting that the attack was real and that he had no involvement in the situation himself.

Members of Hollywood who spoke out in support of him have since recanted their statements, and Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show has even mocked the story in a film parody trailer of the alleged plan.

The move came a day after the 36-year-old was charged with lying to Chicago police about the allegedly staged incident, in which he said two masked men beat him and slung a noose around his neck while yelling racist and homophobic abuse.

Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, will be removed from the final two episodes of the current season of Empire, according to 20th Century Fox Television, which said it wanted to avoid “further disruption” on the set of the show.

Smollett faces up to three years in prison if convicted in the case, which has become fodder for the culture wars that have roiled the United States since Donald Trump’s 2016 election.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” Empire’s co-creators and producers said in a statement. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

Lawyers for Smollett did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. On Wednesday, they said they were conducting a thorough investigation to form an aggressive defense.

According to court documents, the black and openly gay actor wrote a personal check for $3,500 to two brother and gave them $100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps that were used in the supposed attack on Jan. 29.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Detectives interviewed more than 100 people, reviewed footage from more than 55 surveillance cameras, and executed more than 50 search warrants during the investigation. Officials did not spell out how Smollett had hoped to boost his salary by staging such a hoax.

Empire co-star Jussie Smollett lied about getting attacked by two Trump supporters on a sub-zero Chicago street.

Smollett says two men attacked him, doused him with bleach, threw a noose-like rope around his neck and yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him. Oh, and one cried something about being in “MAGA country,” meaning President Donald Trump’s supporters were to blame.

Smollett’s story had gaping holes in it from Day One.

Why couldn’t the cops recover any video footage of the attack despite a plethora of cameras working around the scene of the “crime?” Who plans to mug someone in sub-sub zero temperature at 2 a.m.? Why did Smollett ask the police to turn off their body cameras during the initial interrogation? Just how many loud and proud MAGA-wearing souls live in hard-left Chicago? Bleach freezes around 19 degrees Fahrenheit. How could it be liquid during the attack?

That’s just a partial list.

Still, most media outlets focused on the alleged attack over those critical questions. The narrative proved irresistible for our biased press. A gay black man assaulted by Trump supporters?

Stop the cyber presses!

Kyle Smith serves up a strong recap of their malfeasance at the New York Post.

The story seemed scientifically engineered for The Resistance TM. And, sadly, today’s reporters too often belong to that group.

Smollett insisted this weekend he didn’t stage the attack in question, even while lawyering up. It’s a perfect time to look back and see what we’ve learned from this news cycle.

The short version? It isn’t pretty. The longer one? It’s a seven-step process.

ONE: The Media Will Never, Ever Learn

The Smollett “attack” story came directly on the heels of the Covington kids news cycle. That’s where virtually every media outlet pounced on a selectively edited video rather than root out the truth. The mea culpas came slowly but surely in that case, but the damage was done. Reporters didn’t do their due diligence.

Again.

If said reporters couldn’t approach Smollett’s claims with the skepticism they deserved, it meant they hadn’t learned a thing from the Covington debacle.

TWO: Celebrities Won’t Apologize (And Here’s Why)

A gaggle of stars rushed to attack both President Donald Trump and his supporters following the alleged attack. Ellen Page lead the way, savaging the Trump administration for directly leading to the attack.

They were wrong. Will they apologize? Why on earth would they? No reporter will ask them to clarify their initial remarks. Their industry peers won’t expect an apology of any sort. There’s no incentive for them to say they’re sorry … so they won’t.

Ava DuVernay, a big league director, isn’t ready to apologize, apparently.

THREE: The Roseanne Standard Won’t Apply

Roseanne Barr’s signature show came back last year, wowing fans and bringing in huge ratings in the process. That’s all the more impressive since situation comedies are not exactly huge these days. She fired off one awful, racially-charged tweet at a former Obama official and ABC fired her, quickly and without giving her a full chance to explain herself.

What Smollett did is far worse. He made the Chicago Police Department, which on a perfect day has its hands full, waste countless hours – and resources – chasing a lie. So why hasn’t Fox fired Smollett yet? Is the company waiting for more information? That’s technically wise, but why wasn’t Barr given similar treatment?

For now, the show’s executive producer is standing firmly by Smollett as his story crumbles to Thanos-like dust. [Editors note: The producers of Empire have since dropped Smollett from the remainder of the season.]

FOUR: Trump Derangement Syndrome Is Very Real

Smollett, like many of his Hollywood peers, loathes President Trump. That’s fine. He’s Tweeted about his feelings, too. Again. No problem. Now, think about how much you must hate someone, anyone, to implicate the person’s followers via a manufactured attack. That’s an entirely different level of rage, and it’s rooted in an insane philosophy.

Trump Derangement Syndrome, or TDS, to be precise.

Yet we’ve seen variations of TDS playing out in La La Land. Why would a respected director like Judd Apatow claim Trump will bring back the worst of Nazi Germany? Or how could professional film critics cheer a movie (Fahrenheit 11/9) that posits the same argument, but in technicolor?

TDS explains a great deal, including how several notable stars appear psychologically broken following Trump’s shocking 2016 electoral win.

FIVE: Local Media Often Trumps National Outlets

This reporter had never heard of Rafer Weigel and Rob Elgas before the Smollett debacle. Now, they deserve to have a larger, more robust following. These Chicago-based reporters covered the nuances of this story without veering into opinion or bias. They updated their audiences on social media, sharing hard news over conjecture. Can mainstream media reporters say the same?

SIX: There’s a Reason the Chicago Police Moved So Cautiously

It’s been fascinating to watch the Chicago Police in action during this news cycle. Their public information officer (PIO) spoke with caution and consideration with every new revelation. Why? The presumption would be the department is racist and wouldn’t be willing to collar Smollett’s attackers with the vigor afforded a white victim.

Also noteworthy: A blistering 2016 report from Democratic Mayor Rahm Emmanuel citing systemic racism within said department.

All eyes were on Chicago. It appears, for now, the department did its job thoroughly under extreme conditions. One caveat … the department had more than a few leaks, apparently, and that reminds us of how the government works of late. Not good.

SEVEN: Here Comes the Spin

In a sane world, reporters would dig deeper into this fracas. Will Smollett be charged for his actions? When will Fox, which broadcasts Empire, fire him? Why did so many people rush to judge this case?

The biggest question? Why are similar hoaxes so prevalent in the Age of Trump?

Instead, here’s what we’re likely to see. “Smollett’s story is real, even if his specific case isn’t.” Or similarly themed tales pointing to other hate crimes or simply the fact they do, on occasion, happen.

Naturally, the least trustworthy name in news, CNN’s Brian Stelter, led the way.

This is important to note, because even though I am convinced the Earth is a sphere, I also believe that dissenting views on science, astronomy, medicine, history, psychology, religion and everything else deserve a platform for speech. In other words, I agree with the free speech rights of those with whom I disagree… with certain narrow limits described below.

Brighteon.com is not a platform for Satanism, for example. Since Satanism videos are welcomed on YouTube and all the left-wing tech giants which are actually run by Satanists, there is no organized censorship of Satanism videos. Satanists don’t need an independent platform for free speech, since they already run Hollywood, public schools, the tech giants and much of the left-wing media. In contrast, Brighteon is a platform for those whose views are systematically censored… including those who discuss minority views on science, medicine, history, consciousness, religion or practically any other topic.

With YouTube now censoring videos about the Flat Earth theory, Brighteon.com become the obvious platform to host those videos without interference; with no down-ranking, no search suppression and no shadowbanning.

You won’t find the truth about 9/11 on controlled “establishment” platforms

Similarly, Brighteon is a platform that welcomes 9/11 analysis videos (from Architects and Engineers, for starters) and videos that question the official narrative on almost anything. If there’s anything we’ve all learned in the past two years, it’s that the official narrative on any given subject is almost always horsesh#t. This is even being admitted now by former mainstream media journalists like Lara Logan.

The “mainstream” media lies to you about everything, including hate crime hoaxes, the Russia collusion conspiracy theory hoax, the “safety” of vaccines, food science, medical science, psychiatric drugs and everything else under the sun. Remember, it’s the corporate media that told us the Covington Catholic school children were mean bullies, but Jussie Smollett was somehow a victim of a hate crime from racist MAGA-hat wearing white supremacists.

If any institution has been thoroughly discredited in modern society, it’s the mainstream media (and the tech giants that censor the truth to promote the media’s lies). That’s why we must keep questioning reality in every way possible. That includes allowing Flat Earth theorists to espouse their own views on public platforms like Brighteon… without the artificial shadowbanning that YouTube, Google, Facebook and Twitter put into play.

Just because the media lies about everything doesn’t mean the Earth is flat, of course. Not every alternative theory is correct. But every conscious being should have the right to argue every alternative theory they wish to explore. The thought police of the tech giants don’t even want people to consider ideas that don’t conform to the establishment narrative. And that’s a very dangerous precedent for a so-called “free society.”

If We the People cannot engage in unpopular speech — or argue minority views on any topic — then we don’t really have the freedom to think, do we?

Rest assured, as much as I disagree with the Flat Earth theory, Flat Earth videos on Brighteon.com will not be downranked in any way. They are ranked exactly the same as any other video, largely based on their title and keyword tags. We don’t track users or profile user behavior, either, so an individual’s viewing habits are not factored into any “recommended videos” algorithms.

There’s one general scientific principle on which I agree with those who espouse bizarre theories about the Earth

Although I don’t believe the Earth is flat, I do believe our entire universe is a kind of “simulation” created by an intelligent designer. I believe we are all living in a testing ground of sorts… a cosmic virtual reality simulator that was created for an intelligent purpose. Within that simulation, the Creator also created the laws of physics, the Big Bang and everything that naturally followed. From my point of view, that includes spherical planets, stars, heavenly bodies and so on.

In that sense, I agree in theory with the big idea that everything we are seeing, experiencing and moving through in our cosmos is a kind of illusion, a “Matrix” of reality that was engineered for a specific purpose. However, I do not believe the Earth is flat, since the laws of physics and gravity in a 3D space would naturally favor spherical bodies, not flat discs. Nevertheless, I agree with the principle of asking really big questions and questioning reality as a whole. Thus, the process of questioning everything is a valuable process, and those who engage in this process should in no way be artificially censored or silenced just because the establishment doesn’t like their conclusions.

Another important point in all this is why the establishment is so concerned about the Flat Earth theory in the first place. If it’s complete nonsense that no one would believe, then why is the scientific establishment so threatened by it that they’ve had to pressure the world’s largest video platform (YouTube) to overtly censor the videos? Seriously, if Flat Earth theory is so childish and stupid, then why would the science establishment feel threatened by it?

Personally, I find Flat Earth theory to be full of many obvious contradictions. For example, I find the explanation of the sun and moon being flat discs very close to Earth to be at odds with directly observable evidence. Just to be sure, I have measured the size of the sun and moon using an angular measurement device (a precision riflescope with a “mils” reticle, indicating milliradians, or units of angle in the metric system). As it turns out, the angular size of the moon does not change in the moon’s high position vs. its position near the horizon, a fact that is consistent with a spherical Earth and a spherical moon, but entirely contradicts the Flat Earth explanation for the movement of the moon.

Thus, I have the curiosity to check things out for myself and use scientific instruments to verify reality. One thing that the Flat Earth theorists have correct is the fact that most people just believe whatever they’re told, without verifying anything themselves. The average person who believes the Earth is a sphere, for example, is wholly unable to explain what evidence they have personally confirmed which would support the idea. Thus, their beliefs are founded in a herd mentality, not evidence or rational thinking.

Notably, I didn’t just trust the “official” view on the Earth and the moon; I verified the size of the moon myself. This is important since the moon’s apparent size is a rather convincing optical illusion when it is near the horizon (where it looks really large). There’s even a saying in Taiwan: “The moon in America is larger.” That’s because America has more wide open spaces where people have the opportunity to see the moon near the equator, where it appears to be unusually large. Yet according to Flat Earth theory, the moon should appear the largest when it is directly overhead, while diminishing in relative (angular) size as it approaches the horizon. If you measure the diameter of the moon using a milliradians reticle, you will find that the diameter of the moon does not change at all, no matter where it appears in the sky.

You can use Brighteon.com to present your own theories, and they’re (almost) all welcomed

The beauty in all this is that, should you disagree with my moon measurement assessment, you are free to use Brighteon.com to present your own arguments and evidence. In fact, we welcome your use of Brighteon for that purpose.

Sign up today (it’s free) and enjoy Brighteon as a platform for free speech. We are currently in the process of a huge R&D overhaul, and when Brighteon 2.0 is rolled out this April, it will be even better. We do not allow videos espousing Satanism or demonic content.

Currently, we have a ban on video game videos (i.e. video footage of people playing video games) due to the immense storage costs associated with those videos, but that ban will be lifted in April when we roll out Brighteon 2.0, because our new infrastructure dramatically lowers our storage costs and enables us to ease restrictions that have been in place so far."

The police superintendent of Chicago, not exactly a man given to impassioned speeches, lambasted the “Empire” actor and the media coverage of his apparently faked attack during a Thursday news conference. Smollett has been written off of the last two episodes of this season of “Empire,” according to TMZ, and some of the cast members are reportedly demanding that he shouldn’t return and ought to be written out immediately.

However, the most creative punishment may have come from former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who suggested during an appearance on Fox News that perhaps the most fitting punishment for Smollett might come from the Old Testament.

In a Thursday appearance on Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News, Dershowitz agreed that Smollett likely wasn’t looking at serious jail time.

While ABC News noted that the charges Smollett faces could end up with a three-year sentence behind bars, Dershowitz argued that the actor would likely plea down and face community service.

However, when Ingraham said the punishment ought to be more strict, Dershowitz concurred.

“I agree with you, I think people who make false reports ought to go jail,” Dershowitz said.

“You know in the Bible, if you falsely accuse somebody you get the penalty that the person would have gotten had the accusation been true, so if in fact these people had attacked him in this racist way and put a noose around his neck, they would have gotten some years in jail,” he said.

“If you’re going to follow the Bible, this guy ought to get the same penalty that he falsely accused people of getting.”

Dershowitz was likely referring to Deuteronomy 19:18-19: “The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely, then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.”

The law professor noted that we ought to treat Smollett the same way we ought to treat anyone charged with a crime in this country: as innocent until proven guilty. However, he also noted this would have been a very grave offense had it actually occurred.

“Look, we have to presume everybody innocent,” he said. “If the facts are as the police say they are, if actually payments were made, and a plan was hatched to put a rope around the neck, and a police report was filed, then we have a potential for a serious crime.”

Let’s pretend that the attack was, in fact, real. This isn’t just simple assault and battery. The use of racial and homophobic slurs would have prompted hate crime charges, as would the noose. Then there was the use of bleach. There’s no plea bargain in the world that would have limited that to community service.

Smollett, of course, won’t be subjected to the Old Testament standard found in Deuteronomy (which isn’t to say that there isn’t a stroke of brilliance behind it). However, allegedly orchestrating an attack on yourself by paying two of your associates $3,500 and then blaming the attack on Trump supporters who yelled “This is MAGA country” isn’t something that should be pled down so easily — especially as police say the motive was because Smollett was upset with his salary.

This was a case that divided America, that made scapegoats of Trump supporters and conservatives. This diverted the resources of the Chicago Police and the FBI. His punishment maybe shouldn’t be strictly out of the Old Testament, but it shouldn’t be a slap on the wrist, either. Given what he’s apparently subjected our polity to, it’s not unreasonable to suggest he himself be subjected to some of what his “assailants” would have faced.

Did you hear that, Saturday Night Live? It is now safe to satirize Jussie Smollett.

After weeks of fearing to tread into this area of comedy due to not wanting to challenge the official line that Jussie Smollett was the victim of a hate crime perpetrated by MAGA hat types, despite a lot of evidence that this was actually a hoax, the comedy floodgates seemed to have finally opened this week. On Friday night the Daily Show presented an hilarious skit brutally mocking Smollett in the form of a Lifetime movie parody.

This new attitude towards Smollett is in stark contrast to a few days ago when the Daily Show host, Trevor Noah, discussed the Smollet situation in a mostly serious manner although a bit of humor did creep through.

So what was responsible for the change in comedy attitude? Perhaps it was because Jussie Smollett lost his victimhood status because of the searing report delivered this week by the Chicago police chief. Or it might have been due to Charles Barkley throwing comedy shade upon Smollett on Thursday's Inside the NBA which made it okay for celebrity comedians to follow suit.

“America, let me just tell you something, do not commit crimes with checks. If you’re gonna break the law, do not write a check. Get cash, man.”

And now that it is ""safe"" to satirize Jussie Smollett, we can expect to see a lot of comedy mocking him in the days and weeks to come. There is already a Star Trek review of this hate crime hoax.

Is it safe? Yes, SNL, you no longer have to worry about carefully following the NBC PC norms. It is now safe for comedy to satirize the guy who wanted victimhood sympathy but ended up living in the nightmare of his own making by being laughed at now and forever...unto the end of time."

Weinstein, who has been accused of abusing women, projected his view of them on the screen.

""There are problems of diversity and sexual harassment across industries, not just Hollywood,"" said Kathleen Tarr, lecturer and specialist in sexual harassment and discrimination at Stanford University's Public Policy Program. ""But it is Hollywood that has the opportunity to show a different type of world that can help us envision what we can do in our real life. It has the opportunity to reach people and say, ‘This is not how it has to look.'""

So, how has Hollywood been faring with the issue of male and female representations since #MeToo started? NBC spoke with three women researcher-activists who follow closely what goes on in Hollywood.

Things Are Happening

""In the list of top 100 films of 2018, there is not a single ‘bro’ film,"" said Caroline Heldman, associate professor of politics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who sees progress. ""The discussions of toxic masculinity are all over Hollywood right now. I don't have numbers yet, but there is no doubt that it has shaped the way men look at their characters too.""

Heldman provided various examples. In ""Jane the Virgin,” Justin Baldoni could have portrayed a Don Juan character who was into abusing women, but instead, his character was framed another way. He started the television series as a macho womanizer, but soon turned into a loving father, a compassionate and respectful person, supportive of women and committed to his family.

Jonah Hill, meanwhile, apologized for films he did with Seth Rogen that celebrated toxic masculinity. Making a film like their ""Superbad"" today, where you are being asked to laugh at degrading women and sexually harassing women, just wouldn't be possible, Heldman said.

The Road Ahead Is Still Long

Still, the number of women directors fell in 2018, and no woman was named for the Academy Awards this year.

directing the industry's top 250 films went down from 11 percent to 8 percent between 2017 and 2018, while the number of producers went up from 25 to 26 percent.

, according to University of San Diego's Celluloid Ceiling report (1).

The proportion of women directing the industry's top 250 films went down from 11 percent to 8 percent between 2017 and 2018 according to the San Diego State University's Celluloid Ceiling report released in January, while progress in the proportion of producers increased slightly from 25 percent to 26 percent.

The UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report 2019, released on Thursday, shows that the proportion of women directors in 2011 was 4.1 percent, pointing out progress, but warning of continuing under-representation ""on every front"" for women. In one example, the proportion of women film writers has decreased over time, from 14.1 percent in 2011, to 13.8 percent in 2016, to 12.6 percent in 2017.

""From studio board rooms and executive suites to the talent agencies that act as gatekeepers, the fundamental relations of production that center White males in Hollywood moviemaking remain largely intact,"" the report notes.

One bright note that could point to a way for a new beginning is television, which the report notes now provides almost unlimited content across a wide array of viewing choices.

Tarr said that the fact that many projects presented by female directors don't get green-lighted is important because it affects the way content is created. For example, in ""Wonder Woman"" in 2017, directed by Patty Jenkins, the superhero has a very different costume than the traditional male-designed hyper-sexualized version of the character.

""Increased awareness does not imply new policies and practices,"" Heldman said.

The kind of systemic change, that makes people accountable for sexist, racist and homophobic content is not yet in place, Heldman said.

Heldman is the creator of Grademymovie.com, where consumers can see how films fared on race and gender diversity across six top cast and crew positions.

Despite women making up more than half of the population in the U.S., they comprise only 17 percent of the top roles on film crews, the site notes.

For Nicole Haggard, activist and professor of Film Media and Social Justice at Mount Saint Mary's University in Los Angeles, the problem is that ""older white men are still making the decisions."" There is less toxic masculinity, but ""the message to women is still that we are only as valuable as how much a man desires us,"" Haggard said.

In ""Hidden Figures,"" where an amazing woman solves the world's most difficult math problem, when she is supposed to go celebrate with her family, she walks in the door and her boyfriend is proposing to her. ""So I'm sobbing, not because this woman solved the biggest problem, but because she's getting engaged,"" Haggard said.

The Future of #MeToo and Hollywood

For Tarr, it is too early to know whether or not #MeToo will continue to gain momentum and affect the industry more deeply. ""If we look back at the civil rights movements that have been successful in this country, this has required a lot of collaboration between consumers, the people who are directly affected, people engaging in litigation. So, those successes have required those communities to come together,"" Tarr said.

The future of #MeToo's capacity to change the system will depend on that, and also on ""whether people who are able to access power within the industry are interested in advancing only their careers, or trying to bring their people with them,” she said."

Upset with a patron at Casa Vallarta on Cape Cod for wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat, a 41-year-old immigrant allegedly yelled at the man and knocked the cap off his head, Boston 25 reported.

The man, who was later identified as 23-year-old Bryton Turner of Mashpee, told police he was minding his own business when Rosaine Santos began to yell at him for wearing the hat. Turner began to record what transpired on his phone.

“That’s the problem – the problem with American these days, people are just ignorant,” Turner said in the video after Santos was seen walking behind him and knocking the hat off.

Bartender Geo Macarao was asked by the station if the man did anything to provoke Santos, but he replied, “No, no he just walked in and ordered his food.”

The woman, who reportedly lives in Falmouth, told police when they arrived that Turner should not be allowed to dine at the Mexican eatery and noted President Trump’s promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. She even allegedly took another shot at Turner as the police escorted her out of the restaurant.

“I couldn’t imagine somebody just coming up and hitting them when there’s cops right here,” Macarao told Boston 25.

“She just tried to grab my hat in front of four officers, not smart,” Turner said.

The Brazilian immigrant offered a sort-of apology but claims that she is the victim in the incident as her behavior was provoked.

“I had a little bit to drink maybe that’s the reason that I couldn’t walk away but being discriminated for so many times in my life, I just had to stand up for myself,” she told Boston 25.

“He’s not a victim. I am the victim. I have been bullied, OK?” she argued.

Santos pleaded not guilty to charges of disorderly conduct and assault and battery, Cape Cod Times reported. She was released on her own recognizance and is set to return to court on March 20 for a pretrial hearing.

The incident is another in a string of recent reports largely ignored by the mainstream media, especially in the wake of the press frenzy over the hoax hate crime staged by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, which was inflamed by the media as it was initially believed the attackers wore MAGA hats.

A report out of Kansas days ago revealed that a Van’s store employee was fired after telling a 14-year-old customer “f*ck you” for wearing a MAGA hat. A 7-year-old boy in Texas was smeared online and verbally attacked in person, even being called “little Hitler” for running a hot chocolate stand aimed at raising money for the border wall. A couple wearing MAGA hats while shopping at Sam’s Club in Kentucky apparently triggered a man who pulled a gun on them.

And on the UC Berkeley campus, a violent leftist thug assaulted a recruiter for Turning Point USA.

Social media reaction to the Cape Cod restaurant assault seemed to be supportive of Turner and many called for President Trump’s supporters to stand up against the bullying.

After being released on $100,000 bail and having returned to the set of Empire, Smollett continued to insist that he’s innocent. What’s more, he is now claiming he’s the victim of a racist, homophobic, police-connected plot against him — video evidence and confessions of co-conspirators be damned.

“Mr. Smollet is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” said a statement released on his behalf Thursday, according to entertainment website Deadline.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the hyperbole-laced statement continued.

The statement is so laced with falsehoods, irresponsible innuendo, and baseless claims it’s hard to take it seriously. But unfortunately, far too many Americans will, which makes debunking it essential.

First and foremost, just how “impeccable” is Smollett’s character? He’s been charged with mailing a false “threat letter” to himself and faking a hate crime. Granted, he’s not been convicted yet, but do people with “impeccable” character do such things?

How, exactly, has “the system” betrayed Smollett? In a country where the rule of law is whatever the current power structure says it is, he very well could have been scooped up off the street, thrown into a police van, and never heard from again. But he wasn’t. Police, working off of evidence and clues, did an investigation first to come to their conclusions that he allegedly faked this hate crime. That’s “the system” working; not liking the results of the system (a finding of probable cause to arrest) is no reason to proclaim it dysfunctional. (Related: ‘Mainstream’ media’s perpetuation of hate hoaxers like Jussie Smollett will lead to violence, war.)

Proper legal processes ARE being followed — what’s the problem?

What’s also clearly evident is that police followed “due process” and are continuing to follow it. Chicago PD didn’t go to Smollett and ask him to report a hate crime; Smollett came to police and reported an alleged hate crime. Due process is police investigating those allegations and coming to conclusions based on the evidence. And the evidence in this case, thus far, indicates that Smollett staged his attack.

As for sentencing, Smollett is not in jail, he’s out on $100,000 bond — which, by the way, is part of the same “system” he claims isn’t working. There’s been no trial yet. There’s been no verdict. There’s been no sentencing. Making this claim is just nonsensical.

The principle of “presumption of innocence” doesn’t mean police should look the other way when they’ve discovered evidence of a potential crime. Again, there’s been no trial and no conviction; for now, consider Smollett’s innocence is presumed.

Justice also isn’t having the police look the other way in the face of a potential crime. Justice is police following all available clues and leads until they are convinced of one of two things: A crime was committed or it wasn’t. Justice is ensuring the guilty are punished and the innocent set free, but at this point, the still-functioning “system” requires a speedy trial of his peers (Sixth Amendment), which he’ll get unless he pleads out his felony charges.

By all accounts, proper legal processes are being followed. Yet if Smollett is eventually convicted of filing a false hate crime report, far too many people will never accept that he did anything wrong. Instead, they’ll believe that it’s just another case where a black man was ‘victimized’ by an ‘unjust, racist’ system.

According to anonymous Empire sources who spoke to TMZ, Smollett may have thought to stage his attack after director and Empire executive producer Lee Daniels' cousin was assaulted in January.

Daniels posted a recounting of his cousin's attack to Instagram on Jan. 10, urging the world to put these sort of incidents in the past.

""This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories,"" he wrote in the caption. ""It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better.""

Smollett turned himself in to Chicago police on the charge of falsifying a police report on Feb. 21. CPD believe that Smollett paid two men to help him stage the attack.

""This publicity stunt was a scar Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve,"" CPD superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters.

Due to the ongoing legal drama, the Empire team made the decision to remove Smollett from the final episodes of the fifth season. The show released a statement about their decision to write Smollett out while making it clear that they support the actor.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,"" the statement said. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season."""

WATCH:



Smerconish began by stating his intention to “link two stories in this country, Robert Kraft and Jussie Smollett.” The CNN host reported that Kraft, who was “charged with misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution” may reportedly not be the “most well known person entangled.” He then called for the legalization of prostitution, comparing it to marijuana as he defended Kraft.

News reports have all the elements, sex, money, stakeout, allegedly even videotape. My take, legalize it. In a world where men and women swipe right for companionship and send nude selfies before showing off the real thing, surely an exchange of money for sex between consenting adults is not an absurd suggestion. Like pot, prostitution should be legal, cleaned up, regulated. Healthy. Let me be clear, of course, no woman should be forced into this line of work and anyone who would attempt to make them indentured servants should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But not a 77-year-old guy who lost his wife of 48 years back in 2011. As it is, I tweeted, it represents the largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett.

Does 77 year old Bob Kraft deserve this for misdemeanor arrest? I’ll argue “no” @cnn 9am pic.twitter.com/eHFCVNqLRl — Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) February 23, 2019

Smerconish then contended that “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate crime hoax, which has dominated the news of late, has taken national attention away from more important issues, such as a recent USA Today “lengthy investigative piece about an examination of 900 yearbooks across the country” which “collected more than 200 examples of offensive or racist material from public universities in the south, Ivy League schools in the northeast, liberal arts boutiques and Division I powerhouses …” (RELATED: Here’s A Round-Up Of Jussie Smollett’s Worst Tweets About President Trump And His Supporters)

The report, Smerconish said, shows “there is nothing unique about Virginia when it comes to blackface.”

The USA Today investigative work should have dominated the conversation on Thursday. You’d think the documentation of widespread racist images would be a time for national dialogue. But it wasn’t. Because all of the oxygen was taken out of the room by Jussie Smollett’s alleged hoax. That’s the damage he inflicted.

They attended the “Global Citizen Mandela 100” concert from December 1-3 to celebrate the centenary birth of the late Nelson Mandela and raise awareness of global poverty.

The trip was paid for by Global Citizen, a nonprofit that lobbies for anti-poverty programs around the world, the Washington Examiner reported.

The group said the presence of members of Congress at the concert would “showcase America’s ongoing commitment [to] health equality and global human rights.”

Other celebrities at the event included Oprah Winfrey and “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah.

“In the spirit of Nelson Mandela, we pledge to keep working with our colleagues in Congress, across the country and across the aisle, to make sure that every child in Africa and at home has the opportunity to thrive and grow in a safe and prosperous world,” Meeks said, according to the Examiner.

“As a Sr. member of the Foreign Affairs Comm[ittee] who understands the importance of both multilateral & bilateral relations on trade & foreign policy, developing that relationship is crucial,” Meeks said when asked how the trip was related to his congressional duties.

The National Legal and Policy Center, a watchdog group, called the trip a “mockery.”

“These members of Congress that were given an all-expense paid vacation to party with Oprah, Jay Z, and Beyoncé in South Africa are claiming with a straight face this was needed to help poor children around the world live better lives,” Tom Anderson, president of the NLPC’s Government Integrity Project, told Examiner.

“This was in fact, a mockery of House ethics rules on gifts and travel, the truly poor, and all Americans that expect members of Congress to live not only by the letter of the law but by the spirit and intentions of the rules of the House of Representatives.”

The congressional members were in South Africa for one full day and used two partial days for travel.

A representative for Sewell said her travel “was pre-approved by the House Ethics Committee and was not paid for at taxpayer expense” and that “Rep. Sewell and several other members attended the Global Citizen Mandela 100 Festival, a platform for world leaders to speak out against racial injustice and inequity, and voice their support for international assistance for underprivileged populations.”

OPINION: My family and I cast off this week for Puerto Rico. A long-planned trip to seek refuge from February's frigidity, we returned to an area of San Juan we know well.

We wanted to spend our tourist dollars in an area hurt badly by Hurricanes Maria and Irma just 17 months earlier. We were curious to see how the recovery was going. We wanted to escape not only the cold, but the onslaught of political and societal tumult we experience daily.

It almost worked.

Like everyone else this week, we learned of the apparent hate crime hoax by Empire actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett alleged that he had received racist, homophobic hate mail, and had weeks later been attacked in Chicago by two men who shouted slurs at him, assaulted him, told him he was in ""MAGA Country"", and poured bleach over him.

He conducted a veritable media tour, terrible and sympathetic as his story appeared to many. It was a high-profile story that seemed to personify ugly facts about America today: 2018 saw a record number of crimes by white supremacists and a record number of hate groups in existence.

It was all, apparently, a lie. According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett sent the letters to himself and paid two brothers $3500 to stage the attack. The actor's alleged motive to construct his victim-hood was money. He was dissatisfied with his $65,000-per-episode salary. Yes, you read that right.

The details of the Smollett story are perhaps less important than its symbolism. Americans' views are, of course, shaped by their experiences. But they are also formed – and reinforced – by wildly divergent media outlets. Americans are drawn into a constant parade of narratives (both true and false) that they either accept or reject, in part because of their implicit biases.

Those who have visibility on rising hate crimes and who believe that the MAGA movement is exclusionary and bigoted, believed Smollett because they saw the incident as reflecting a new and awful reality. Cynics felt in their bones that Smollett's story was fake because they do not see discrimination in the President's vow to ""Make America Great Again"".

We've been here before. And recently. The MAGA Hat-wearing Catholic school student Nick Sandmann and Native American elder Nathan Phillips. Depending on your view, either the teen smirked, condescending and arrogant, as Phillips tried to defuse a confrontation. Or, the teen was simply smiling, listening to Phillips' music and standing his ground as Phillips pushed his way into the group of boys.

And it's not just Americans. Supporters of Brexit characterise Europe and European immigrants in a vastly different way to supporters of the ""stay"" movement. The gilets jaunes rioters in France consider President Emmanuel Macron's fuel tax increase as the arrogant maneuvering of an elite completely out of touch with the struggles of the working class. Others see it as a necessary step to protect the environment and thwart fossil fuel reliance.

MARIO TAMA / GETTY IMAGES After the devastation of Puerto Rico's two Hurricanes in 2017, it's comforting to believe the rebuild has coincided with a new crop of ""hurricane babies"".

Which brings me back to Puerto Rico. When we asked about Maria, we often heard about six-hour waits at petrol stations to purchase fuel to run home generators. Maria quickly took out Puerto Rico's dilapidated electricity grid. It took almost a year for power to be fully restored to the island. We also heard a more unusual story. On our last day, we met Enrique, a waiter, who asked the age of our three-month-old daughter, telling us he had a four-month-old girl named Adriana at home. With bright eyes, he told us that Adriana was a ""hurricane baby"".

He explained that Maria's terror and carnage led many Puerto Ricans to figure out what was really important to them. He said that his then-girlfriend Zailene came looking for him after the storm had passed. ""I knew"", he said, after years of dating and some equivocation, that she was the one.

As Enrique told it, Adriana was born in an unusually busy maternity ward a year after Maria's devastation. Looking to substantiate his story with data of other hurricane babies, and cognisant of the fact that Adriana was conceived a few months after Maria, I uncovered no research on Maria specifically, and conflicting research on the phenomenon of so-called ""disaster babies"".

Still. It was a beautiful story. The silver lining in Maria's devastation was a raft of new beginnings. It was a narrative I wanted to believe in.

And so, I do.

And I get it because my pants are invariably walked through in the cuffs or have a flowering hole in the knee or some pattern of bleach stains.

It’s definitely a class marker though. The wealthy newcomers in town all have tailored jeans; they fit perfectly. There was a store on the street where you could buy a close approximation, but they started out at over a hundred dollars, and none of us could spend that much for a pair of jeans; it’s obscene really. So, if the options are to look like a slovenly hobo in thrift store pants, who doesn’t really fit into the world somehow OR to look like a dummy who spends too much on clothes, might as well be a girl really, well it’s better not to maintain the pretense of fitting in anywhere.

And trust me, this does matter now because every man you see on the street these days is a little past middle-aged and appropriately overweight and they’re all standing around smoking or shuffling through their lottery tickets, and every one of them is in ill-fitting pants. Not one of these men is wearing a cloth mask over their mouth and nose. This time last year these men would have been here, invisibly, but they would have been outnumbered by bespoke young men in bespoke jeans and young women who will walk you off the sidewalk three abreast. All of those weekly-haircut, tailored jeans people are gone now, of course. And the expensive jeans place is gone too. So are two other clothing stores and three restaurants recently closed. And who really cares?

It was in January we started hearing about people dying in China and elsewhere with something that was probably just like the flu really. And, in February, we heard about people in Europe and even the states with it, but the survival rate was tremendous. By March, it was here in Canada too and people were starting to stay home. By April, everyone was staying home, except for the few thousand homeless people who drift like ghosts throughout our city. In May, those men seem to have been raptured and replaced by the middle-aged men whose pants don’t fit- nor their lives. The wealthy newcomers have begun to visit a little, in their cars, for a few hours a day, like an evening tide of money, or colonial administrators in a third world village. The louche older men in the doorways of newly-shuttered clothing stores and restaurants watch them come and go, smoke, shuffle their lottery tickets like talismans.

And those older men are the ones most likely to die, should they get this foul disease that seemed to terrify everyone else who was less likely to die. At least, they’re more likely to die than to win the lottery. Yet they take no precautions and pay it no mind. They intrude on your space in stores or on the sidewalk; a dynamic plenty of women have noted in the past. They’re not exactly living free of all fear I don’t think. It’s more like they accept it as inevitable. I’ve heard a few of them say something like this: “if you’re going to get it, you’re going to get it, there’s nothing you can do,” as if they were talking about fate or predestination or the furies.

As if it was a matter of accepting one’s lot in life. There are people who do this, you know: they shoulder the burden, whatever it is. They expect the worst, and they’re seldom disappointed. Disappointment is a privilege, you know. All of these older men seem to know the facts of the matter; I don’t get the feeling they’re misinformed, uninformed, conspiratorial, or oblivious. I don’t think it’s “toxic masculinity” either. I think it’s fatalism. If death comes for them, well, so be it.

And here’s the thing to remember: to some extent, we all live in obligation to one another. But, after a certain age, living is a responsibility that no one places upon us. We retire from jobs; marriages come to an end; our kids move away and barely see us; we keep going in the absence of any expectation. So, it’s a hard thing not to become a little indifferent to one’s ongoing survival. Who for? You can’t see the ocean in the darkness, but you can hear it lapping at the shores, and in the middle of the night it sounds a little like it might be calling for you. So, why not walk towards it?

Of course, this short circuits one of the cherished tenets of Enlightenment societies: that people will act rationally in their own self-interest, if they can only be given accurate information. There are plenty of times we don’t, in ways big and small. We stay in bad relationships for too long, do things that aren’t healthy or wise. We ignore safety regulations at work. We drive like maniacs. We’ve all gulped down micro-doses of death to see how close we could come to the edge of something that was deafening and annihilating.

And, in terms of the old men in poorly-fitting pants, what’s been the most disheartening about all of this is that, without exactly saying the words aloud, the rest of us seem to have collectively decided that, if the elders and the “immunocompromised” are the ones most likely to die of this virus, it should be up to them to fend for themselves- for the good of the community. They have a responsibility not to interfere greatly with the functioning of our economy (which we’ve misidentified as a society). So, we’ve politely withdrawn their social obligation to survive.

Of course, it’s too horrible to say any of this so baldly, so we find nice ways to phrase it. But I think that does us no good, recoiling into a cozy bed of euphemisms. Instead, we should learn from the horror. We know the reality in our guts, which is that this in not how healthy cultures survive. Sericide, or geronticide, exists more in myth than in any historical reality. The Japanese practice of ubasute -- leaving elders to die atop mountains -- was a folk legend that most likely never happened, a cautionary tale. Inuit leaving the elders on ice floes likely only happened during times of extreme famine. The Nordic Ättestupa cliff jumps have no basis in historical fact. We’re not in a pre-civilized time and modern post-industrial societies are not facing starvation or mass suicides if the service economy remains closed longer than we’d like. These are folk tales.

Believe it when I say that talking in platitudes about letting the elders self-isolate and fend for themselves is something really pretty novel in the modern world. There have been cultures that did this; none of them lasted more than a few decades. At the very least, if you don’t value your old men and women in poorly-fitting pants, you should hope your own children aren’t taking notes for when you get old and the waves are lapping at the shore in the darkness. Clutch your talismans tightly regardless.

Smollett, a gay, black actor who appears on Fox’s “Empire,” claimed he was attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he walked on the street near his apartment building in Chicago. Smollett said two white men shouted racial and homophobic slurs as they struck him and wrapped a rope around his neck, yelling, “This is MAGA country!”

Since then, Chicago police say their investigation found that the attack, which was condemned by politicians and activists as an indication of the violence plaguing America under Trump’s leadership, was faked. The initial attack prompted calls for anti-hate crime legislation from many Democratic presidential candidates. As noted by The Washington Post, most have pulled back on their support for Smollett.

Smollett was charged Wednesday with filing a false police report, which is a felony, and he was arrested Thursday.

Trump on Friday tweeted his reaction to the actor having trashed the image of Trump’s supporters.

“JussieSmollett – what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?” the president tweeted.

During her Friday interview, Sanders explained that Trump was responding to the attacks from the left that linked Trump, his policies and his supporters to what police say was a fake attack.

“There were so many people, including a lot of leadership from the Democrat Party — everybody from Nancy Pelosi, Cory Booker and a number of others, mostly those that are running for president — that quickly came out and attacked the president, blamed the president,” Sanders said.

Sanders said the incident was much like the social media indictment of teenagers from a Kentucky school who were falsely accused of baiting a Native American man and deluged with attacks even after the truth came out that they had not instigated any confrontation.

“In fact, as we learn more it certainly seems like the only person to blame in this case is Smollett, and it’s another sad example of people so quick to want to attack and come after this president, much like you saw with the Covington kids and certainly with this case as well, and the president is pushing back,” she said.

Smollett was cut out of the last two episodes of “Empire” this season after he was criminally charged, and he faces the possibility of one to three years in prison if convicted, according to CNN.

“We live in a country where you are presumed innocent,” Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. said Thursday during Smollett’s court proceeding. “However, if these allegations are true, I find them utterly outrageous. Especially the violent, despicable use of a noose, which conjures such evil in our country.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson slammed the actor as well as the news media that gave his case so much attention.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series, on a midseason break, returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged.

“Empire” has nine episodes left to air in its fifth season; the last two episodes are still being worked on. The show returns from its winter break on March.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

ADVERTISEMENT

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars."

The Democrat-Reporter of Linden, Alabama, announced Friday that Elecia R. Dexter will take over as publisher and editor from Goodloe Sutton, who has run the 140-year-old paper since the 1960s.

Although Sutton will continue owning the weekly, which has a circulation of about 3,000 people, Dexter, 46, told The Associated Press that she “will handle everything else.”

Since he ran the paper, Sutton developed a history of publishing racially and ethnically insensitive editorials, according to NBC News.

—Bennett College granted temporary accreditation while legal challenge persists—

Dexter said she hoped her appointment would signify to the community that “this is everybody’s paper.”

“I think it can be helpful,” she said.

The change happened a week after Sutton wrote and published an editorial that began: “Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again.”

The editorial blamed Democrats and “Democrats in the Republican Party” for plotting to raise taxes, so Sutton argued the Klan should raid their communities.

In an interview with the Montgomery Advertiser, Sutton suggested that lynchings would help clean up Washington. Sutton also questioned whether the KKK was violent, claiming America’s most feared white supremacist terrorist organization “didn’t kill but a few people.”

Dexter, whose family is from rural Marengo County, near the Mississippi line – which is where the newspaper is located – said she started working at The Democrat-Reporter recently and has a good working relationship with Goodloe. She told NBC News: “I told him there were some different ways you could have made your point.”

—Jussie Smollett allegedly told police he’s battling an untreated drug addiction—

Some in the community have written the paper supporting Sutton’s views and others wrote emails saying they were “disgusted” by his bigotry.

Sutton’s comments prompted Auburn University and the University of Southern Mississippi to rescind previous honors for him. Two decades ago, Sutton was heralded for running stories that exposed police corruption in the sheriff’s office. Because of his recent comments and newspaper articles, the Alabama Press Association censured Sutton and suspended the Democrat-Reporter’s membership.

The paper was founded in 1879, and its editorials tend to be right-leaning and often critical of Democrats. The irony in the name is that when the paper was created, white conservatives in the South were referred to as “Democrats.”"

It was just a few weeks ago when news first surfaced that Jussie Smollett said he was attacked as racist and homophobic slurs were hurled at him. Each day since then has been eventful, to say the least: Like the best roller coasters, the investigation of his claims has had so many highs and lows, speculative twists, and unconfirmed turns that it was hard for many to believe the Empire actor was indeed a victim. I was not one of them. I chose, and choose, to come from a place of believing people who say they’ve been victimized. And for this, in spite of the charges against him and in the words of Queen Bey, “I ain’t sorry!”

I have to admit that, when word about the alleged attack started spreading on social media, I was emotional. I immediately flashed back to my own run-in with a man who wanted to hurt me because of how I show up in the world. My eyes watered as I was again confronted with the notion that visibility alone doesn’t protect Black LGBTQ+ people, that no matter how out and proud we are, such self-assuredness can also be a target. The 49 people killed and 53 others wounded in the Pulse nightclub mass shooting also came to mind — how these queer, mostly Latinx people and their friends were gunned down in what was supposed to be their sanctuary. What Smollett said happened to him was something all too familiar.

Two days ago, the Chicago Police Department charged Smollett with a Class 4 felony for falsifying a police report. Prosecutor Risa Lanier offered a detailed account of the investigation which, she says, proves the actor staged the incident and paid his assailants. She cites a heap of interviews, phone records, and surveillance footage as evidence. After Smollett turned himself in and posted bail, it was announced that his character was written out of the final two episodes of Empire, which is currently filming its fifth season.

Smollett has not yet released a statement, but his lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson told Deadline on Thursday: “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

For the better part of a week now, my own social media has been a shitshow. As more and more leaks from CPD occured, leading up to eventual charges, self-identified conservatives, bots, and other detractors flooded my mentions and DMs.

“Should we still believe Jussie lol,” someone wrote on Twitter.

“Crickets on Smollet from the great value version of Shaun King, @TrevellAnderson. Shocker,” said another. (I confess, this one gave me a much-needed cackle.)

I’m struck by people’s elation that Smollett possibly lied about his attack. It’s as if they feel vindicated that the evidence might justify the anti-Black and anti-queer intentions in which some of their skepticism was rooted. But what the response confirms for me is that, as a society, we aren’t as progressive and forward-thinking as we’d like to believe.

For the sake of clarity, if Jussie Smollett lied, he should be held accountable. I’m unsure if that should be done in a court of law, public opinion, or otherwise, but he will have to atone. But asking those of us who supported Smollett to apologize or change course? Don’t expect it — not from me, at least.

When it comes down to people coming forward and saying they have been violated — physically, emotionally, sexually, etc. — I will always initially verbalize a belief in their claims. Doing so helps to shift the culture, ever so slightly, in a direction of empathy and meaningful aid for those who need it most.

As Tarana Burke, founder of the Me Too Movement said on Twitter, “We say ‘believe survivors’ because it is the first step toward transformation and because it requires empathy but it also, often, expands our understanding of what bodily autonomy looks like.”

“By saying *believe* survivors, be clear that it means START with the premise that folks aren’t lying and then handle the disclosure with the seriousness and gravity it deserves until a satisfactory solution is reached,” she continued.

There are many reasons victims don’t publicly disclose incidents they experience — fear of and mistrust in the police are chief among them. But let us all remember that only between 2% and 8% of hate crime reports are hoaxes, “a tiny number,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, when compared to the many instances even the federal government contends go unreported. And our culture has only just begun to reckon with what happens when victims are loudly, proudly heard, thanks in no small part to the #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and #TimesUp movements.

Some have said that Smollett, what with a story they believe was absurd and stranger than fiction from the beginning, didn’t deserve this benefit of the doubt. They say those of us who believed him — and not unconfirmed leaks from a CPD that has rightfully earned everyone’s skepticism — were blinded by identity politics and a hatred for Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters. But we do ourselves a disservice by picking and choosing who we believe, and I don’t need an attack on a Black gay man by Trump supporters to know that his administration doesn’t truly care about Black, queer, or Black queer people.

Surely, there are a number of takeaways that this circus and alleged stunt teaches us. Most of all though, is the realization that far too many people still don’t believe victims, and perhaps after this, they never will. But it’s not Smollett’s fault. Y’all weren’t believing them before him anyway.

Kraft was one of many people busted in what police said was part of a large investigation into sex trafficking.

Smerconish argued today that prostitution should be legalized, adding, “No woman should be forced into this line of work, and anyone who would attempt to make them indentured servants should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”

“But not a 77-year-old guy who lost his wife of 48 years back in 2011,” he continued. “As it is, and as I tweeted, it represents the largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett.”

In addition to tweeting the above, Smerconish also posted a photo of the Daily News KRAFT AMERICAN SLEAZE cover and said he doesn’t really deserve this:

Does 77 year old Bob Kraft deserve this for misdemeanor arrest? I’ll argue “no” @cnn 9am pic.twitter.com/eHFCVNqLRl — Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) February 23, 2019

He brought that point up later in the show, in response to a tweet from someone saying, “I can’t believe @smerconish is defending Bob Kraft as an unwitting perp in a sex trafficking ring. Kraft chose those girls because he knows they’re voiceless and powerless.”

“How do you know they’re voiceless and powerless?” Smerconish asked. “How do you know they don’t choose that life? Look, I said very clearly at the outset of the program that if this is a case of indentured servitude, then those who put those women in that path, their employers, need to be held accountable to the highest extent of the law.”

But, holding up the Daily News cover, he asked, “Does he deserve this? Seriously, does he deserve this?”

In response to a BAN BOB headline, Smerconish asked, “Ban Bob? For a misdemeanor? 77-year-old guy who was looking for some short-term companionship? We should ban him? That’s ridiculous. And what a waste of law enforcement resources. No greater waste of law enforcement resources except Jussie Smollett’s hoax. Alleged hoax.”

But prosecutors say it really happened. They allege “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett hired two men to orchestrate what appeared to be a racist, homophobic attack on himself in Chicago on January 29.

Smollett hired brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, and paid them $3,500 to stage an attack, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said Thursday.

Smollett reported the attack to police who investigated it as a possible hate crime. But as the story unfolded over the weeks, its numerous twists and turns culminated with Smollett’s arrest Thursday on suspicion of filing a false police report.

On Friday, the executive producers of “Empire” said that while they were waiting for the legal process to play out, they would remove Smollett’s character, Jamal, from the season’s final two episodes.

The investigation: Text messages and secret meetings

The alleged plot’s electronic trail dates to January 25 when Smollett texted Abimbola Osundairo and said, “Might need your help on the low. You around to talk face to face?” prosecutors alleged.

He gave the brothers directions on the staged attack and told them to put a noose around his neck and shout “‘Empire’ fa***t” and “‘Empire’ n***er,” as well as to make a reference to “Make America Great Again,” prosecutors allege.

Smollett took the brothers to near the site of the purported attack, which had a surveillance camera on the corner, prosecutors said. The actor told detectives two men attacked him near the lower entrance of a Loews hotel in Chicago

After laying out the plan and rehearsing it, prosecutors said, Smollett gave the brothers a $100 bill to buy clothing and rope for a noose.

The staged attack went ahead as planned, with the brothers mildly punching Smollett with gloved hands, according to Johnson, the police superintendent.

“As far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on his face were most likely self-inflicted,” Johnson said.

Phone records indicate Smollett talked to the brothers about an hour before the alleged attack, an hour afterward, and after they left the country for Nigeria, authorities said.

Police initially treated the matter as a hate crime, but they could not find video of the incident from surveillance cameras in the area.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” Johnson said. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

The arrest: Rideshare and last-minute confessions

Even without footage of the incident itself, police found video of two people in the area, and their proximity to the incident led investigators to focus on them as “persons of interest,” police Commander Edward Wodnicki said.

From there, police used hours of video footage — from about 35 police pod surveillance cameras in the city, and more than 20 private sector surveillance cameras — to piece together their movements, he said.

It was the footage documenting the men’s arrival to the scene that produced a breakthrough.

Tracing their steps in reverse, investigators saw them getting out of a taxi about three blocks from where the alleged attack would take place, about a half-hour before the altercation would happen, authorities said.

Investigators tracked that cab ride backwards and learned the men had flagged the cab down after exiting a rideshare car.

The rideshare, an Uber, meant someone ordered it with a phone app. Further investigation led police to discover that one of the Osundairo brothers had ordered the Uber from his apartment, authorities said.

That helped investigators determine that the Osundairo brothers were the people they were looking for. They had taken the Uber from their apartment to where they picked up a cab, and the cab dropped them off close to the eventual attack site, authorities said.

“That (rideshare) was the lead that we needed in order to identify the two persons of interest,” Wodnicki said.

With the rideshare information in hand, investigators then found evidence connecting the brothers to Smollett.

The brothers flew to Nigeria on the evening on January 29, many hours after the attack. They flew back to Chicago on February 13, and investigators met them at customs when they returned, authorities said.

Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo asked for an attorney once in custody, Johnson said.

The men told officers that Smollett, who is black and gay, first “attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language. When that didn’t work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack,” the police superintendent said.

The revelations necessary to charge Smollett came during the 47th hour of a 48-hour holding period for the two men, who eventually confessed to the alleged plot, Johnson said.

After cooperating with police, the two were released without being charged last week and went before a grand jury Tuesday, Johnson said.

Alleged motive: Money and publicity

Investigators believe Smollett staged the attack “because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” Johnson said, citing information that the Osundairos gave to police.

The actor took “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson said.

Smollett has maintained that he did not make the story up. A source told CNN that as recently as Thursday, he reiterated to the “Empire” cast and crew he was innocent of the charge against him.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,” his attorneys said in a statement.

“Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

In a statement released Thursday night on behalf of the actor, his attorneys described the bail hearing as an “organized law enforcement spectacle.” The judge granted a $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond. He was ordered to give up his passport and will remain under supervision until his case is adjudicated.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” the statement said.

Police reaction: Anger and criticism

During Thursday’s news conference, Johnson repeatedly chastised the media for devoting more attention to the Smollett case than to other victims of violence in the city.

“I am offended by what’s happened and I’m also angry,” Johnson said. “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim.”

The superintendent said, however, that Smollett was given no more attention than any other alleged crime victim, but he lamented that resources devoted to this investigation could have been deployed elsewhere.

The aftermath: Supporters express disappointment

Some on social media expressed anger at Smollett for potentially tarnishing the public’s trust in victims moving forward.

Sen. Kamala Harris, who last month described Smollett’s attack claim as an “attempted modern day lynching,” said she’s frustrated and disappointed by the turn of events.

“When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward,” Harris wrote on Twitter.

20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment initially stood behind the actor and his role on “Empire.” But on Friday, the show’s executive producers said they were removing Smollett’s character, Jamal, from the final two episodes of this season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the statement reads. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The filming of the season’s finale episode is in progress this week and next week.

Smollett faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct over falsely claiming he was attacked, police say.

Under Illinois law, filing a false police report is disorderly conduct and punishable by one to three years in prison. Smollett is due back in court March 14."

In the grand scheme of things, a charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report is no more mysterious or upsetting than any other comparable charge. However, the idea of concocting a hoax hate crime in order to advance one’s career prospects seems not only unfathomable but incredibly reckless.

If police in Chicago are correct, that’s exactly what actor Jussie Smollett did. The investigation into what was originally alleged to have been a disturbing hate-motivated attack on the actor has turned into an investigation that has resulted in Smollett himself being arrested and charged.

As Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson put it during his press conference Thursday, “I’m left hanging my head and asking why — why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make a false accusation?”

It was originally alleged by Smollett that in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, he was attacked by two masked men who then poured some kind of chemical on him and placed a noose around his neck — all while shouting racist and homophobic slurs, even stating at one point that “this is MAGA country.”

As dreadful as that all sounded, it was a little over the top. The idea of violent and racist Trump acolytes roaming around the streets of Chicago at 2 a.m. in the midst of a polar vortex seemed to stretch credulity.

As it turns out, police say, this was all orchestrated by Smollett himself. It’s alleged that Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 — paid by cheque, strangely enough — to stage the attack and that Smollett’s wounds were self-inflicted scratches. They even say he sent himself fake hate mail prior to the fake attack.

All of this was done to try to advance his career, police say. As it stands now, it’s hard to see how his career can recover.

Not only did this exploit a lot of goodwill from people who heard the story and were genuinely concerned for his well-being, but this exploited and stoked a lot of political divisions and tension in America. It’s bad enough to make up a lie for selfish reasons, but it’s so much worse when that lie has broader consequences for society (to say nothing of wasted police resources in a troubled city that can ill afford such a thing).

A plausible case can be mounted that President Donald Trump himself is the source of a lot of division in the United States. However, this attack created a false narrative that many were too quick to believe: that not only had a hate crime taken place but that the perpetrators were aligned in some way with Trump.

Granted, a hoax is designed to fool people and so it would be unfair to blame everyone who was taken in by it. At the same time, though, we all need to be aware of our own confirmation bias. When we want something to be true in order to confirm our pre-existing beliefs, we lose the patience to wait for the evidence to come in and the critical thinking skills needed to evaluate it when it does.

So while the pendulum may now swing toward more skepticism, there’s a real danger that it will swing too far. A hoax like this only makes it more likely that victims of actual hate crimes will not be believed and thus may not even come forward in the first place.

Such hoaxes are relatively rare, but having one with a high profile such as this one is bound to give people a warped perspective of the matter.

For his part, Smollett denies all of this and continues to maintain his innocence. And it’s true, these allegations have not been proven in court. If and when they are, it will be a further indictment of Smollett that he refused to own up to his actions and refused to acknowledge the harm that his actions caused.

All of which speaks to the need for a stiff penalty if indeed he is found guilty of this. It’s not just about his own alleged misdeeds, but about also making sure actual victims are protected.

Some crimes call out for a strong deterrent and a loud societal condemnation. Hate crime hoaxes stand as an obvious example of that.

According to police and court records, Mr. Smollett staged the attack as if he were a director putting on his first play. He paid two brothers who had worked on “Empire” $3,500, asked them to buy ski masks and a noose to use as props and told them which epithets to hurl when they attacked him. The police say Mr. Smollett even scoped out neighborhood security cameras to ensure the assault would be recorded.

Mr. Smollett’s lawyers say he is innocent, but his career now hangs in doubt after “Empire” executive producers wrote him off the season’s final two episodes, and his tale of hatred and racism has instead become a cultural brawl over deception and “fake news.”

The Hollywood friends who rallied behind Mr. Smollett the loudest are now struggling with where to place their allegiance — with their outspoken friend Jussie, or with the Chicago Police Department, an agency long criticized for its treatment of black people. In this case, though, the police laid out an unusually expansive and detailed timeline that appears to undermine Mr. Smollett’s claims."

Some simply think there’s more to the story while other believe he may have some sort of mental illness. But, according to a conversation Smollett had with cops, drugs may have played a big part in his actions.

Page Six reports, that the actor actually told cops he has an untreated drug problem. TMZ even noted that the “Empire” star has purchased drugs from one of the men involved in the case and it’s possibly a move that may help him get less prison time if he is convicted.

As of right now, Smollett has been released from police custody. He has maintained his innocence and will learn his fate very soon.

“The problem is there aren't that many hate crimes occurring in the country,” the pundit said Friday on Tucker Carlson Tonight. “So, instead, reporters take their numbers wholesale from partisan activists who pose as researchers, or from wholly fraudulent organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups use moral panics to gin up fund-raising, they get rich doing it, so, of course, they continue.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center, to be clear, monitors hate groups throughout the U.S. and reports those activities to the media and law enforcement. The SPLC released a report last week showing that the number of active hate groups in the U.S. have surged to 1,020, a 20-year high, and that extremists today—including black nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-confederate—prefer “polo shirts and khakis to Klan robes.”

The latest FBI statistics from 2017 show that 2,040 law enforcement agencies all over the country that year reported 7,175 hate crime incidents involving 8,437 offenses.

Those numbers didn't appear to figure into Carlson's world view.

“It's just not a very hateful place, so they have to make them up,” Carlson said. “How do they do that? They do it, and this is key, by counting accusations as crimes. An accusation is not the same thing as a crime, it's not even close.”

Carlson claimed that the message—from The New York Times and others—surrounding Smollett’s allegations of a hate-crime was “shut up and believe it, or else you’re a bad person, if not clinically insane.”

Smollett made international headlines last week when he claimed he was injured in a homophobic and racist attack. After a passionate week of punditry and fighter-pointing, Smollett was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of filing a false police report. Chicago police claim the alleged attack against him was, in reality, a “publicity stunt” devised over a desire for a better salary.

Police have alleged that Smollett planned to take “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

In the end, Carlson said, “the few people who are willing to think for themselves turned out to be absolutely right, and the press is scrambling to explain how exactly did that happen. How could reporters who are literally paid to be skeptical have fallen for such an obvious lie?”

He added, “This is the new official story, the one you are going to be hearing for a long time, the one your kids will be learning about in school, and it's this: a specific hate crime may not have happened in this case, but hate crimes overall are incredibly common, and the incidence of them is rising.”

“The problem with what you just heard is it's a crock, it's totally false,” Carlson continued. “In fact, it's provably untrue. Anyone who says otherwise, like the people you just heard, is either intentionally misleading you, or doesn't understand the numbers—and that would include most journalists. Type in the phrase ‘hate crimes’ into Google and you will see story after story claiming that thousands of these atrocities take place every year in our country and the incidence of them is rising.

“In real life, hate crimes are rare,” he concluded."

According to the Dallas News, Babbs “could put justice at risk, because she has now tainted her testimony in search of a payout.” The outlet also said, “Unfortunately, Babbs has seen fit to turn her witness into an opportunity for victimization, self-aggrandizement and enrichment. She took to gofundme.com to raise money for herself after she says she was fired for being a witness in the case.”

In addition, according to KRLD radio, Guyger’s lawyer are “now questioning whether Babbs is a credible witness because she was using the shooting to solicit donations.”

It sounds like that powers that be are trying to do everything they can to discredit the one person who could put Guyger is the jail cell she deserves.

Babbs’ GoFundMe page, which raised $30,000, read, ““I… [have] received countless harassment… I was working for a pharmaceutical company, a loyal employee for 3 years working my way up in the company.

They also blacklisted me.”

Guyger claimed that following a long day on the job as a Dallas police officer, she implausibly mistook his apartment for her own and, after ordering Jean not to move, shot him twice before realizing the error of her ways. Her story was met with doubt because of a number of factors, especially her assertion that Jean’s door was ajar. Videos posted on social media by neighbors appeared to show that apartment doors in the building shut automatically, which seemed to indicate that Guyger was lying.

In addition to the inconsistencies in her alibis, which have changed several times, Dallas police, of which Guyger was a member for five years before being fired, appeared to be helping to cover up the shooting for their colleague. The department was accused of allowing Guyger enough time to scrub her social media accounts and get her story straight before turning herself in three days after killing Jean. It also gave Guyger enough time to move out of her apartment, which was never searched by police despite five warrants allowing them to do so.

Murder charges against a police officer are notoriously hard to prosecute. There are roughly 1,000 police shootings every year in the United States, but officers seldom face justice. According to CNN, only 80 cops were arrested on murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings between 2005 and April 2017. However, only 35 percent of those arrests led to convictions in that 12-year period.

Let’s hope Botham Jean gets justice.

The actor, who plays the openly gay character of Jamal Lyon on Empire, has received a lot of backlash to say the least. If the crime was faked, then people can’t help but wonder why. If it wasn’t, the crime was horrifying.

It was in the early hours of January 29, 2019, that Jussie Smollett claims to have been the victim of a heinous crime the publicly initially labeled both racist and homophobic. The actor was said to have been left beaten, drenched in bleach, and with a rope tied about his neck.

Jussie Smollett’s legal troubles start after new evidence

However, new evidence came to light which suggests Jussie Smollett paid two men to assault him. The two men were brothers originally from Nigeria, and during their police interview they stated they were paid $3,500 to do the attack – supposedly, it was even rehearsed.

The evidence in question was so convincing the brothers were released and the main focus of the investigation turned towards Smollett. He is now under investigation for filing a false police report.

It’s clear this possible publicity stunt might have put the Empire actor out of work, for good. Is Jussie Smollett done working in Hollywood after the attack scandal? Here’s what we know.

Jussie Smollett will be written off ‘Empire’ this season

An article by Deadline reported that many of Jussie Smollett’s scenes in Empire were cut after news broke he may have planned the attack. It also states some of the scenes were cut due to scheduling conflicts with his police interviews. The report states that, although Fox had not responded to comment requests, that five of Smollett’s scenes and his big musical number were cut from Empire.

Once police charged Smollett with a felony for allegedly filing a false police report, Empire executives confirmed Smollett would indeed be written off Empire entirely by the end of the current season.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” co-creators Lee Daniels and Brett Mahoney and executive producers Danny Strong, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer told Fox News.

Trevor Noah defends Smollett – kind of

The African-born comedian and host of The Daily Show has tackled this strange, twisting story as part of his nightly discussion. Trevor Noah defends Smollett … kind of. Even fans can’t quite grasp whether Noah’s entire defense was sarcastic, or whether it was (in part, at least) genuine. Either way, he had quite a few choice words to say.

When Noah watched Smollett’s Good Morning America interview, he felt compelled to respond to the possibility of Jussie Smollett losing his role in Empire. “Either this guy’s telling the truth, or he deserves an Emmy for that interview, because if all of that is just a performance, I don’t care what he’s lying about, you can’t cancel him. He’s just too good to not be on TV.”

Trevor Noah also went on to point out a few things he thought were “fishy” from the very beginning. “Who are the MAGA supporters who hate gay people, who hate black people, but also happen to watch Empire? I’ve heard of hate-watching but that shit would be next-level. That’s like a member of the Klan buying tickets to ‘Fiddler on the Roof.'”

Is Jussie Smollett done in Hollywood for good?

With the case still under investigation, a lot of things are still up in the air – including whether he will continue to have a career in Hollywood post-scandal. If it turns out that Smollett is proven to have staged the event, it is very possible he will (at the very least) not be cast in anything for a while and could even spend time in prison. If it can be proven that he’s telling the truth, however, we could still save his career. Only time will truly tell."

The 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault.

Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, who is also black, said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose.

Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"".

The star's lawyers issued a strongly-worded statement after the hearing, calling it an ""organised law enforcement spectacle"" and describing Mr Smollett as ""a young man of impeccable character"".

Jussie Smollett emerged from the Cook County Court complex after posting 10% of a $100,000 bond in Chicago What happened in court?

""That symbol conjures up such evil in this country's history,"" Judge Lyke said of a rope that Mr Smollett claimed the attackers had hung round his neck, according to the Chicago Tribune .

The judge's comments at Thursday's court appearance alluded to the racist lynchings of thousands of black Americans in the post-American Civil War era.

Mr Smollett, who stars on the TV series Empire, is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack on himself.

The siblings are co-operating with the investigation, police say.

Chicago officials say Mr Smollett also sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio before staging the attack.

Judge Lyke set Mr Smollett's bail at $100,000 (£76,000), which requires him to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport.

Mr Smollett denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct. His lawyers said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"".

Jack Prior, one of the actor's attorneys, told the court the accusations were ""inconsistent with Mr Smollett's character"" and that the actor ""wants nothing more than to clear his name"".

If convicted, he could be sentenced to three years in prison and made to pay for the cost of the police investigation. What did police say?

In a news conference earlier on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the ""shameful"" scheme.

""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"" he said.

""How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?""

Supt Johnson accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".

CCTV image released earlier by Chicago police

He said Mr Smollett had betrayed the city of Chicago, and said ""this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve"".

The ""hoax"", he said, ""received national attention for weeks"", and may deter future hate crime victims from coming forward for fear that their allegations may be met with scepticism.

He called upon the actor ""to apologise to this city that he smeared"".

""Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,"" said Supt Johnson, with palpable anger.

""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" he added, describing Mr Smollett's actions as a ""slap in the face"" to Chicagoans. What did Smollett's lawyers say?

They dismissed Thursday's proceedings as ""an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system"".

A statement from the actor's legal team added: ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

""Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Celebrity websites TMZ and Page Six said the actor was back on the set of Empire after the bail hearing.

Rallies were held after Mr Smollett first announced the alleged ""attack"" How did the case unfold?

The gay actor said he had gone out to buy food late at night on 29 January from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago city centre when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him.

He said they also punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck.

Mr Smollett also claimed the men had told him ""this is Maga country"", referring to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

An outpouring of support followed , including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell.

In an interview last week with ABC's morning TV show, Mr Smollett tearfully said he had been ""forever changed"" by the alleged incident.

Mr Smollett has been a vocal social activist for years

But suspicions mounted as police were unable to find any video footage of the incident from over 50 surveillance cameras they reviewed. There were also no witnesses.

Investigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app.

The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US for Nigeria following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week.

They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said.

One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago.

Police say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 for the brothers' participation.

Supt Johnson said that Mr Smollett had told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary from Fox.

According to the Huffington Post , Mr Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role in Empire, which has about 18 episodes per season.

Investigators said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on Mr Smollett's face were probably self-inflicted.

Supt Johnson said Mr Smollett first ""attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself at Fox studios.

Police had confirmed in early February that white powder - later identified as aspirin - was in the letter.

During another news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up.

He told police that incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say Mr Smollett would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack.

On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including balaclavas, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.

Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday.

Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which make Empire, issued a statement on Thursday saying they were ""evaluating the situation"" and ""considering our options.""

In the aftermath of the attack, Democratic White House hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both called the incident a ""modern-day lynching"".

Ms Harris, a California senator, on Thursday said she was ""sad, frustrated, and disappointed"".

President Trump tweeted his condemnation after the police news conference of Mr Smollett's ""racist and dangerous comments"".

Smollett, of course, is the black and gay actor who claimed he was the victim of a “lynching” carried out by Trump supporters in Chicago. After investigators dug into the story, however, they determined it didn’t happen how he said.

Instead, Smollett himself was arrested on a felony charge after police said he paid two Nigerian-American bodybuilders to fake the assault, which he then falsely pinned on Trump supporters.

Anger toward Smollett has flowed from both sides of the political aisle, especially after many liberals found themselves embarrassed for believing the hoax. Even the Chicago police chief, himself an African-American, expressed outrage that the actor had wasted resources in a city full of real crimes.

But instead of being righteously fed up with the hoax, one leftist commentator decided to unleash a conspiracy theory against cops.

During an appearance on MSNBC, Zach Stafford — the editor-in-chief of LGBTQ magazine “The Advocate” — ranted against Chicago police and suggested that they had framed Smollett while covering up a crime.

“The police were openly confirming and not confirming certain reports and not doing it to other parts of the story, due to the vocal nature in this case, it was really peculiar,” Stafford said, as if he were the authority on which details the Chicago Police Department was permitted to comment on.

He then suggested on national television that police officers in Chicago were all conspiring against Smollett because of — you guessed it — Donald Trump.

“People have a lot of reason to not trust them (Chicago police officers)… a deep history of openly lying to citizens,” he alleged. “This police department did, in 2016, openly, through their union support Donald Trump.”

He was apparently referring to the Fraternal Order of Police, which agreed with Trump on the need for strict anti-crime measures in a city with the ninth highest homicide rate in America.

If there was any doubt that Stafford was pushing a conspiracy theory about bias within the Chicago PD, his next statement cleared it up.

“To have a police department that hasn’t been as cooperative as they have been this round, do not openly give information, do openly lie and mishold (sic) information in cases and then to know that they have openly supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, a lot of activists on the ground are saying, ‘Wait, what’s going on here?” he said.

“Who do we believe out of these two suspect people?” he finished, suggesting that he doesn’t think the police are telling the truth.

Yes, he just called the Chicago police force liars and suspects because he doesn’t like admitting that a gay black man might have committed a crime.

The implication was clear: It couldn’t possibly be that a spoiled, rich actor faked a crime for attention. No … even though dozens of detectives found that Smollett lied and even his alleged accomplices have admitted the hoax, in Stafford’s mind the “real” sham is being perpetrated by the entire Chicago police department to protect Trump.

And remember, Chicago is one of the most liberal, Democratic cities in the country. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson is himself a black man who presumably despises hate crimes as much as anyone. But none of that matters. It must be a Trump plot, facts be damned.

At the same time, MSNBC’s refusal to shut down his anti-cop rant or push back against it with basic facts confirms why so many Americans are fed up with the establishment media. They essentially just gave a platform for someone to spread his personal conspiracy theory on national television and didn’t even have the spine to call him out.

This is Trump Derangement Syndrome taken to a whole new level. Blowhards like Stafford become part of the problem when they refuse to accept evidence and would rather push an unfounded, anti-police conspiracy. To them, the narrative is more important than anything — even reality.

And like Comey, he’s getting hours and hours of airtime to sell laughable notions, like the idea that the FBI has been utterly nonpartisan.

This man will say anything. Truth means nothing. He’s worse than Comey. It barely matters to his interviewers that he was fired from the top of the FBI for … allegedly lying his face off to the FBI. The Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz — appointed by former President Barack Obama, not President Trump — charged McCabe with lying three times under oath about having leaked to the newspapers, and not for a national security reason, just to make himself look good. While the media relish the idea of jail time for Trump aides caught lying to investigators, this man gets a red carpet and a pat on the back.

McCabe’s book tour has created headlines like this, from a CNN interview: “McCabe: It’s Possible Trump Is a Russian Asset.” Let’s be blunt. This is as credible as birtherism. It’s exactly as responsible and reliable as broadcasting a headline that says, “Trump: It’s Possible Obama Was Born in Kenya.” McCabe is the Jussie Smollett of the Justice Department.

McCabe’s publisher, St. Martin’s Press, is reaping a bonanza of book advertising. Thirty minutes on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” 15 minutes on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” 24 minutes on ABC’s “The View,” an hour on NPR’s “Fresh Air,” 30 minutes on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” 40 minutes on MSNBC’s “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” 20 minutes on CBS’ “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Then more MSNBC: On Feb. 20 alone, he had 40 minutes on “Morning Joe,” another 40 minutes on “Deadline: White House” and then 20 minutes on “All In with Chris Hayes.” Then came the “PBS NewsHour.”

There’s an obvious term for a media that offers a shameless partisan liar this much free advertising/mudslinging. It’s the “Opposition Party.”

McCabe despises Trump. The press (and Hollywood) despises Trump. The media love McCabe. Most of these journalists have presented McCabe as nonpartisan and skipped asking (or even reporting) about how his wife, Jill McCabe, ran for the Virginia state Senate as a Democrat in 2015, and how Clinton crony Terry McAuliffe directed almost $500,000 in PAC money to her campaign. This created an obvious conflict of interest if McCabe was later working on the Hillary Clinton email probe. The media forced then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia probe, but McCabe never recused. It was never an issue.

The toughest pushback on McCabe’s lying came from … Meghan McCain on “The View.” She said to his face: “I don’t believe you’re a reliable narrator. And I’m not convinced this not just some kind of PR campaign to stop yourself from getting indicted. You were fired at the recommendation of the FBI.” Republican members of Congress like Rep. Jim Jordan have sounded this same alarm — including new charges of lying — but their objections aren’t included in the gushy interviews.

McCabe’s lying under oath also drew several minutes on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” and even then, NPR cut the interview into two segments and eagerly promoted the other half — the Trump-and-Russia half.

Most interviewers flunked. “60 Minutes” and “Morning Joe” strenuously made excuses for lying under oath. Anderson Cooper arrived on the subject only as the interview wrapped up. NPR “Fresh Air” host Terry Gross tossed one perfunctory question. MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell and Nicolle Wallace didn’t ask a single question about it over their 40-minute interviews.

Unsurprisingly, comedian Stephen Colbert did worse than avoid the question. As he asked McCabe to grade the press on their Trump-scandal coverage, he joked with McCabe that he was “under oath right now.” Those words mean nothing to McCabe. That’s why he smirked.

According to the police, Smollett orchestrated a fake attack against him, hiring two Nigerian-American brothers to pretend to be white President Donald Trump-supporting racists, including having one yell “MAGA,” police said.

After his arrest, the 36-year-old “Empire” actor told police officers that he has a drug problem and that he’s never been treated for it, reported TMZ. However, in court documents, Smollett answered “no” when asked if he had alcohol or mental problems.

Abel and Ola Osundairo were identified as the brothers who Smollett allegedly hired, paying $3,500 to them for the fake attack.

In charging documents, prosecutors said that Smollett was close friends with Abel, 25, after meeting in the fall of 2017. During that time, they worked together on “Empire,” socialized outside of work, and worked out together. In one statement Smollett’s team issued, it said the actor hired Abel at one point as his personal trainer.

Text messages obtained by detectives showed that Abel “was a source of designer drugs” for Smollett, prosecutors said.

“Specifically, since the spring of 2018, on several occasions, Defendant Smollett requested Abel to provide him with ‘Molly,’ which is a street name for the narcotic Ecstasy,” they stated.

According to TMZ, Smollett’s alleged untreated drug problems could be a mitigating factor if he’s convicted.

Smollett’s Character Removed From ‘Empire’ Episodes

Smollett’s character will be removed from multiple episodes of “Empire,” executive producers said on Feb. 22.

Twentieth Century Fox Television said in a new statement.

Smollett plays the character of Jamal Lyons on the show.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” Lee Daniels and six other executive producers said in a joint statement released by Twentieth Century Fox Television.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” they added.

Twentieth Century Fox said in a previous statement after Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report on Feb. 21, that executives were “evaluating the situation and considering our options.”

“We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process. We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options,” the company added.

Smollett was released on bond later on Thursday and was slated to appear in court on March 14 to enter a plea.

In a press briefing, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that Smollett’s motivation was frustration with his pay.

“This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” he said. “Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

Smollett has not spoken publicly since the brothers were interviewed by police but has maintained his innocence through his legal team."

The Senate is set to vote Monday on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE). As the title implies, the legislation provides legal protection to babies who survive attempted abortions and mandates that they receive immediate medical care. Forty-nine senators — all Republicans — have co-sponsored the Sasse bill.

It is a travesty that such legislation is even necessary. But we can thank Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) for kick starting this national discussion.

As you recall, Northam shocked the country a few weeks ago when he callously suggested that a baby could be delivered then “resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired,” followed by “a discussion … between the physicians and the mother” about whether the baby should be terminated.

In the wake of Northam’s remarks endorsing infanticide, Sen. Sasse called for a snap vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. But one left-wing Democrat objected and blocked the vote. Senate Majority Leader McConnell vowed that the Senate would vote on the bill and he’s keeping that promise Monday.

Senator Sasse also warned his colleagues:

“Every member of the Senate is going to have to answer. They can stand with babies or they can defend infanticide with Governor Northam — those are the choices. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be the easiest vote any senator takes.”

Just to be absolutely clear, my friends, this is a life and death issue. This is not a hypothetical debate about when life begins, although we know the answer to that.

There are people alive today who have survived late-term abortions. They have powerful stories to tell. They are living testimonies to the sanctity of life, which deserves protection at every stage of development.

And kudos to our friends at Focus on the Family!

Focus has arranged for a doctor to perform a 4D ultrasound in Times Square on Saturday, May 4th. The event, known as “Alive From New York,” will draw attention to the humanity of the unborn child and to the extremism of the pro-abortion law recently signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo.

I am also pleased to report that the Trump/Pence Administration yesterday issued a finalized rule cutting off federal Title X funding to clinics that perform abortions or refer for abortions. The new rule could cost Planned Parenthood $50 million a year. Of course, the rule will be challenged in the courts, but a similar Reagan-era rule was upheld by the Supreme Court.

Enough Hate

The Jussie Smollett case has drawn a lot of attention to the concept of hate crimes. The actor claimed he’d been the victim of an assault because he is black and gay and anti-Trump.

Of course, as we know from Thursday’s incredible press conference, the Chicago Police Department has determined that Smollett’s story was just that — a made up story. His alleged hate crime was a complete hoax. In reality, the only hate crime was the one Smollett perpetrated on the people of Chicago and against conservatives across America.

Left-wing politicians and pundits were so eager to believe Smollett’s story because, as Evan Thomas famously put it, the narrative was right even if the facts were wrong. It reinforced the left’s belief about the portion of the country that Hillary Clinton wrote off as “deplorable and irredeemable.""

Meanwhile, real crimes committed out of hatred for conservatives are often ignored.

Every week brings another example of a White House staffer or conservative media personality being accosted or assaulted for their political views. And as the Covington Catholic School boys found out last month, there’s no more certain way to provoke an attack than to don a red MAGA hat in public.

Earlier this week, a conservative activist was assaulted while recruiting students for a conservative club at the University of California-Berkeley. Seemingly unaware of the concept of irony, the attacker accused the conservative victim of promoting violence as he punched him in the face.

That fits the definition of a hate crime. But I doubt it’ll be prosecuted as one, if it’s prosecuted at all.

When conservatives defended the idea of free markets in health care, they were accused of being racists. When conservatives defend the idea of securing the border, the left immediately resorts to charges of white supremacy and xenophobia. When conservatives say immigrants should learn English, the left says that’s bigotry.

(Meanwhile, we have a dysfunctional immigration system that is literally importing more hate into the country.)

But the labeling of normal conservative ideas as hate is a ""hate crime” itself.

The left so hates conservative ideas that it wants to completely shut down the debate and silence the opposition. So it resorts to the most inflammatory rhetoric and charges possible, obviously not out of any desire for genuine debate or understanding, but just plain old hate.

Here’s another example to keep in mind.

Two years ago, James Hodgkinson, a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter, shot up a baseball field full of Republican congressmen in an attempted mass assassination. He was a fan of a Facebook group called “Terminate The Republican Party.” After the shooting, police found a “hit list” of Republican congressmen in his pocket.

The shooting, which nearly claimed the life of Rep. Steve Scalise, was clearly a hate crime. Yet the FBI declared that it could find no evidence of political bias.

That asinine conclusion tells you everything you need to know about the biased Obama/Comey FBI that has been leading the Trump/Russia, Hillary/email investigations.

The result of all of this is that more and more Americans feel there are two systems of justice. Violate a liberal’s safe space, and you’ll get charged with a hate crime. But physically assault a conservative, and the left, including the liberal legal system, will look the other way.

The sad reality is that there is already too much hate in society today. We don’t need to be making it up or inventing hate where none exists."

Production sources tell TMZ that soon after the video went up, Lee came to set and explained the situation in more detail to the horrified cast and crew. The theory is that some Empire employees believe that this is where the wheels in Jussie’s head started to turn. That maybe he could be come what is described as an “LGBT hero”.

The news that Smollett has become inconsequential and obscure reached TheSpoof.com earlier this evening, and a perfectly good made-up tale involving Smollett and the Ku Klux Klan had to be scrapped, due to a distinct lack of public interest.

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor, has been arrested after he was charged with lying to police in connection with the alleged attack on Jan. 29.

“Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told a news conference, adding that the actor paid $3,500 to two brothers to stage the supposed hate crime.

“This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with this salary. He concocted a story about being attacked,” Johnson said. “We gave him the benefit of the doubt.”

Smollett had claimed that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump had struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance over him.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office approved felony criminal charges against Smollett for disorderly conduct and filing a false police report, police said on Wednesday. He has a bond hearing scheduled for later on Thursday.

Last week, police arrested two brothers who were recognized from surveillance footage of the area where Smollett said the attack occurred. One of the brothers worked with Smollett on “Empire,” according to police and their lawyer.

Police released the brothers two days later without charges. They confessed and became cooperating witnesses, Johnson said.

Since the alleged attack, Smollett had received support on social media, including from several celebrities and Democratic presidential candidates. But others were skeptical of the incident, which Smollett said occurred around 2 a.m. on a Chicago street during one of the city’s coldest weeks in recent history.

In an interview with “Good Morning America” last week, Smollett said he was angry that some people questioned his story, and he suggested the disbelief might come from racial bias.

Officials from 20th Century Fox Television, which airs “Empire,” did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Johnson called for Smollett to apologize to the city.

“How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?” the police superintendent said.

Sources close to the show told TMZ some of Smollett's former co-stars think Smollett started thinking about staging the attack after Daniels shared a video on Instagram on Jan. 10. In the video, the Precious filmmaker called out homophobia, writing in the caption, ""This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories.""

""It’s the beginning of a new year and we need to do better,"" Daniels wrote in the caption. ""We need to continue to remember to love and to turn against the hate that we’re seeing out there. But we all need to fight that fight together.

Daniels also told his fans to support GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign and the Trevor Project, which provides suicide prevention intervention to LGBTQ+ youth.

TMZ's sources said Daniels shared more about the attack on his cousin with the Empire cast and crew.

Smollett claimed he was attacked by two men on Jan. 29 while walking to his Chicago apartment. He claimed they yelled racial and homophobic slurs, dumped an unknown chemical on him and put a noose around his neck. However, Chicago Police now say the attack was a staged hoax, intended to get Smollett attention because he was unhappy with his salary on Empire. Smollett allegedly paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack with a personal check.

Smollett turned himself in to police Thursday morning after being indicted for allegedly filing a false police report. He was released after posting part of his $100,000 bond and reportedly went back to the Empire set.

On Friday, Fox announced his character was being written out of the final episodes, and there are rumors he might be recast.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" Empire producers said in a statement. ""Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

The producers said in order to ""avoid further disruption on set,"" Smollett's Jamal character was cut.

Smollett himself has maintained his innocence. His representatives said he feels ""betrayed"" by the criminal justice system.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,"" the statement read. ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.""

Kelly’s alleged victims, outlined in explicit detail the alleged sexual assault that transpired on the VHS videotape that he turned over to authorities.

At a press conference in Chicago on Friday shortly after criminal charges against Kelly were announced, Avenatti provided more detail on the content of the 40-minute videotape, which included Kelly allegedly assaulting a 14-year-girl who is heard repeatedly calling him “Daddy,” Page Six reports. The lawyer, who recovered the video and turned it over to Chicago prosecutors, is representing at least one victim identified in Kelly’s grand jury indictment.

According to Avenatti, Kelly, whose birth name is Robert Kelly, could be seen sexually assaulting the teen at his house at some point in the late ’90s — “approximately 1999.” The video is a mashup depicting two separate assaults of the same girl on two different days. On the video, the girl’s age is also apparent because both Kelly and the teenager allegedly state her name out loud.

—R. KELLY ARRESTED! Prosecutors charge singer with sexually abusing 4 people, including 3 minors—

“It is clear from other things that are depicted on the video that this was in no way role playing during some sexual act,” Avenatti said during the press conference. “Mr. Kelly throughout the video stops what he’s doing, stops his acts of sexual assault, and proceeds to move the video camera, adjust the camera angle — zooming in, changing the direction of the shot and things of that nature. So there’s no question that he knew exactly what he was doing.”

“It is clear that Mr. Kelly is having the victim watch another piece of pornography (allegedly on a big-screen television), which appears to be him with yet another young girl,” according to Avenatti.

“There are also instances of Mr. Kelly urinating on the young girl on the videotape,” he added.

And this isn’t all. Avenatti claims that there are at least two other tapes “in existence” — another of which they “are in the process of recovering,” he said.

Avenatti became a household name for serving as the lawyer representing porn star Stormy Daniels — but whom now also represents two of Kelly’s alleged victims, two parents and two “whistleblowers” who Page Six described as “knowing” Kelly and being among his “inner circle.”

“Today marks a watershed moment in the 25 years of abuse by this predator known as R. Kelly,” Avenatti said. “He — together with those that enabled him — undertook a course of action over two decades to abuse and sexually assault young girls, many of whom were the most vulnerable in society.”

In an interview on the Karen Hunter Show on SiriusXM, the lawyer said he agreed to take this case on pro bono because – with two daughters of his own – it hit home.

“I’m not charging anything for the work that I’ve done because this is an outrageous case and it’s an outrageous abuse of power, targeting some of the most vulnerable people in our society,” Avenatti said in the interview. “Mainly young African American girls, many of whom are from the inner city. And I’ve been very moved by it because I have two daughters on my own, 14 and 16, and as a father and listening to some of these parents describe what has transpired and some of these victims, I was outraged by it.”

—Jussie Smollett allegedly told police he’s battling an untreated drug addiction—

Avenatti said his investigation uncovered just how subverted the Pied Piper of R&B was, even dating back to his 2008 child pornography trial, when he allegedly committed obstruction of justice of “through threats and intimidation of witnesses,” among other things, according to Page Six.

“This trial was rigged in 2008, make no mistake about it,” blasted Avenatti. “I am highly confident that this time around the result will not be the same.”

In the first court case, Kelly was found not guilty of 14 counts of child pornography that hinged largely on a separate sex tape in 2002. Some of the allegations in that tape mirror this recent case – he allegedly urinated on another underage girl.

But there is one huge difference in the quality of the tapes, Avenatti said at Friday’s press conference: “The video is far superior,” he said.

And Avenatti also made a prediction in the SiriusXM interview: There will be a price to pay for many of the people surrounding R. Kelly who knew what he was doing and enabled his dirty deeds.

“…he had a lot of people helping him and I gotta tell you, I’m disgusted by the fact that all these people, and there were a lot of them, they participated in this criminal activity and they looked the other way, all in the interest of money,” Avenatti said. “It was all about money and taking care of the Golden Goose known as R. Kelly. And I find that equally disgusting and I think that when this whole thing is said and done, whether it be in Cook County or New York, or federal charges, there’s gonna be a lot of other people that are gonna have to account for their conduct and why they turned a blind eye to young African American girls being sexually assaulted and abused all in the interest of money.”

Officials say investigators were suspicious of Smollett from the outset.

Officers were dispatched to investigate a brutal racist, homophobic attack on Smollett early on the morning of Jan. 29. During the attack, he said, two men threw a rope around his neck, in the manner of a noose.

When officers arrived at the actor's apartment in Chicago's swanky Streeterville neighborhood about 40 minutes after the alleged beating, one detail caught their eye.

“Chicago Police Officers observed that Smollett had a rope draped around his neck,” said Risa Lanier, a Cook County State’s Attorney. “This was captured on police body worn camera. Seconds later, Smollett asked police to shut off the cameras.”

Still, police continued for nearly three weeks to publicly identify Smollett as a victim of a possible hate crime.

That all changed after police arrested two U.S.-born brothers of Nigerian descent – Abel and Ola Osundairo – as they arrived in Chicago Feb. 13 from a two-week trip overseas.

Abel, 25, was a close friend and personal trainer of Smollett who provided the actor with the club drug Ecstasy, prosecutors say. Both brothers had worked on the set of ""Empire.""

Smollett was charged this week with disorderly conduct by filing a false police report.

Prosecutors say he falsely told police that the perpetrators flung racial and homophobic slurs as they pummeled him, poured a chemical substance on him, and screamed “This is MAGA Country,” a reference to President Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.

He remains free on $100,000 bond as he awaits trial.

The Osundairo brothers initially resisted giving police much information. But as investigators prepared to charge them with a hate crime, prosecutors say, they came clean.

Eventually, the Osundairos' defense attorney Gloria Schmidt told police her clients would give police a video statement.

The brothers said Smollett paid them $3,500 to assist with a carefully choreographed attack, police and prosecutors say. They also said Smollett was involved in sending a threatening letter addressed to him at the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is filmed. The letter arrived at the studio one week before the alleged hoax attack.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett was unsatisfied with his salary for the Fox television show and wanted to use the attack to raise his profile.

Investigators say they learned many of the details of the alleged conspiracy through their conversations with the Osundairos.

The brothers might never have made it on to detectives' radar if it weren't for an array of roughly 55 city, business and doorbell cameras that captured snippets of the men's movements as they came to and from the crime scene.

“It was because of these (police) cameras, our investment in technology in the city of Chicago and the great assistance from the community with those other cameras that led us to a really solid timeline of where our two persons of interest went,” said Commander Edward Wodnicki, who led the team of detectives investigating the case.

Police started with a grainy video that showed only the silhouette of two men walking away from the scene soon after the attack. Wodnicki said it was just enough for police to begin tracking the Osundairo brothers “forward” from the crime scene.

Footage showed the brothers jumping into a cab not far from where Smollett said he was attacked. Investigators were able to track down the cab driver, who had a security camera inside the taxi that captured the brothers' faces.

The brothers took the cab several miles to the city’s North Side before they “abruptly stopped the cab” and began walking, police say.

At that point, Wodnicki said, investigators began looking backward in time in hopes of spotting the brothers in video footage near Smollett’s home before the alleged attack occurred.

They would find footage of the brothers getting out of a taxi just blocks from the crime scene, Wodnicki said.

That taxi, which was also equipped with a camera, provided police with additional video footage of the Osundairos, Wodnicki said. Investigators backtracked the brothers' movements to the point where they hailed the taxi – about two miles from the crime scene in the city's Old Town neighborhood.

Security or police cameras in Old Town captured footage of the brothers arriving in the neighborhood by Uber shortly before they got into the taxi, Wodnicki said.

From there, Wodnicki said, it took a only search warrant to figure out that Ola Osundairo had hailed the ride using his smartphone from the brothers' home on the city's North Side.

That proved to be ""the lead we needed to identify the two persons of interest,"" Wodnicki said.

Through the brothers’ eventual cooperation – as well as phone records – investigators were able to further establish that Smollett and Abel Osundairo spoke briefly by phone a little more than an hour before the attack, according to Lanier, the prosecutor.

Smollett told Abel Osundairo during that call that the attack should be carried out at 2 a.m. at an already scouted location near the actor’s home, Lanier said. Minutes later, Ola Osundairo hailed the Uber and the brothers started making their way to the crime scene.

Less than 18 hours after the incident, Smollett and Abel Osundairo traded brief phone calls, Lanier said. The brothers then boarded a flight for their overseas trip. The next day, Smollett made a nearly 9-minute call to Abel in Turkey, Lanier said.

“The way that they carried this out, there was never a thought in their mind that we would be able to track (them) down,"" Johnson said. He credited the detectives' intense focus on helping crack the case.

While the Osundairos allegedly assisted in the scheme, Wodnicki indicated that police see them as victims whom Smollett was attempting to wrongly implicate in a hate crime. Prosecutors have not commented on whether the brothers have been offered immunity for their cooperation.

Bo Dietl, a former New York Police Department detective, called the brothers “scumbags” for taking part in the alleged hoax. Still, he said, it would be understandable if prosecutors didn't go after them.

“With cooperating witnesses, sometimes you have to weigh out culpability,” Dietl said. “In reality, you have to look at who is the main person. Sometimes you have to give a person a play to get to the main culprit.”

Johnson lambasted Smollett for trying to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.”

In the days after Smollett reported the attack, celebrities and politicians including 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Corey Booker and Kamala Harris expressed outrage.

Over the three weeks police were investigating the alleged hoax attack, Chicago endured at least 18 killings and dozens of shootings.

Among the victims of gun violence were 1-year-old Dejon Irving, who was shot in the head on Feb. 7 as he sat in a car with his siblings and grandmother. The boy remains in critical condition. Police believe the assailants were targeting his mother.

While Dejon’s shooting received little national media attention, Smollett’s case attracted media coverage from around the globe.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention, because that’s who deserves the amount of attention we’re giving this particular incident,” Johnson said."

His lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said, “I think all the women are lying. Mr. Kelly is strong, he’s got a lot of support and he’s going to be vindicated on all these charges — one by one if it has to be.”

Nearly two months since the docuseries “Surviving R.

He is facing three to seven years in prison for each count and there will be a bail hearing later today. See the footage of R. Kelly in handcuffs.

After several accusers came forward in recent months, two more women — Latresa Scaff and Rochelle Washington — did the same on Thursday.

Represented by Gloria Allred, Scaff said she met the singer at a 1996 concert in Baltimore. “When I first met R. Kelly that night, I was very happy and excited because I was young and starstruck. However, now that I am an adult, I feel hurt by what he did to me when I was only 16 years old and under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, which had been provided to me at his afterparty.”

Attorney Michael Avenatti recently gave a video to Cook County prosecutors, which could be where Friday’s charges stemmed from. The lawyer said in a statement that he was hired last April in connection to multiple allegations of Kelly sexually assaulting minors. He claimed to have a 45-minute VHS tape as evidence, which, despite its similarities, was not the same video got Kelly indicted in 2002 — and acquitted in 2008 — for child porn.

We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that this predator is brought to justice. pic.twitter.com/D0dGFzgXlX — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) February 14, 2019

One major legal problem that Kelly faces is that Illinois has no statute of limitations on sex crimes against minors. In 2017, Illinois enacted legislation that ended a requirement for child sex abuse victims to file a report within 20 years of turning 18 years old.

When Smollett turned himself into the police, he revealed that he has a substance abuse issue, which can possibly be aligned with evidence of purchasing ecstasy from one of the brothers he worked with in orchestrating the attack. Smollett did deny alcohol and mental health issues.

Smollett’s case has taken over headlines in America, even garnering the attention of President Donald Trump. Smollett is currently released on bond.

In court documents, Smollett answered “no” to whether he had any mental or alcohol problems.

POLICE USED DOZENS OF SECURITY CAMERAS TO CATCH SMOLLETT

A painstaking review of more than four dozen surveillance cameras — including some hidden in residents’ doorbells — helped Chicago investigators uncover Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate hoax, police said.

Police Commander Edward Wodnicki recalled step-by-step how police tracked down the two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who say they were paid by the Empire star to help him stage his own hate assault.

Police culled footage from about 35 Chicago police “pod” cameras in the Streeterville neighbourhood where Smollett lives and where the attack took place on Jan. 29, as well from more than 20 private cameras, including the hidden gadgets.

“I gotta say, that was super helpful in this investigation,” Commander Wodnicki said at a press conference this week. “The city came together to investigate and help the police with this crime.”

“It was because of these pod cameras, our investment into technology the City of Chicago and the great assistance from the community in giving us those other cameras that led us to a really solid timeline of where our two persons of interest went,” he said.

Police worked backward to track the Osundairos’ movements — learning that the two men fled on foot and then jumped in a cab after they allegedly staged the attack.

The cab was located and led cops to a critical piece of the puzzle: a ride-share car the duo hailed to get to the scene of the supposed assault.

“That was the lead that we needed in order to identify the two persons of interest,” Comm. Wodnicki said. “At that point, we had a real good timeline of where these two people went.”

According to Page Six…

Jussie Smollett told cops he has an untreated drug problem — raising questions about whether he might try to use the claim to at least get any potential prison sentence reduced, according to a report Friday. The “Empire” star divulged his alleged drug problem after turning himself in Thursday morning on charges he filed a false police report involving a hate crime, TMZ reported. Prosecutors said Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, one of the brothers who helped Smollett allegedly stage the Jan. 29 hate attack, served as Smollett’s drug dealer, selling him Molly several times since the spring of 2018.

He has an untreated problem with Molly? I had to look up what or who Molly was or is.

According to Wiki…

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, is a psychoactive drug primarily used as a recreational drug. The desired effects include altered sensations and increased energy, empathy, and pleasure. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 30–45 minutes and last 3–6 hour

I guess ecstasy needed a rebranding in the ’80s and the term Molly began to surface. I don’t see where in the description above where it leads you to lie about being assaulted to try and increase your value in the entertainment world. Maybe I’m missing something here.

There is a very fine line here that needs to be walked. Drug addiction is a serious problem in this country and needs to be dealt with. People do some pretty damn odd things under the influence of all types of drugs. However, Jussie planned this, called cops to report it and went on T.V. to defend himself and his alleged faux story according to prosecutors. I don’t think this is a result of having an untreated drug problem, I’m thinking this is him learning how to be a better actor. He was pretty convincing in his pre-arrest interview and statements that he had nothing to do with the attack on him.

What I also find interesting is that, so far, we have heard nothing about Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo who helped stage the attack and also allegedly sold Smollet the drug, being charged with anything. The police said on Thursday no deal had been struck for the brothers to go before a Grand Jury to testify and nothing being done about this part seems a lil curious to me.

This does seem like an obvious ploy to start to muddy up the water, being it looks like the prosecutor has the goods on Jussie. His only hope is to try and cut a deal before a trial and try to lessen what could be handed down from a jury.

Although, maybe his newfound acting skills could help him out.

Maybe.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” read the statement from series co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, showrunner Brett Mahoney, and executive producers Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” the statement continued. “While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett — who plays the openly gay Jamal Lyon on the series — surrendered himself to Chicago PD early Thursday morning, hours after he was charged with filing a false police report.

The actor’s bail was set at $100,000 and within hours of his release, Smollett returned to work on the “Empire” set and addressed the cast and crew, saying …”I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls. I wanted to say I’m sorry and, you know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

The move to boot him off the series comes after a TMZ report that many of his co-stars feel betrayed by the actor so they want him written off the show immediately.

Police say Jussie’s case was about money — that he orchestrated his own hate crime because he was dissatisfied with his salary on the show. But according to Forbes, he earned an estimated $125,000 per episode.

Smollett’s team released this statement Thursday night: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

His next court date has been set for Thursday, March 14."

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” said a statement from 20th Century Fox Television attributed to the show’s executive producers. “Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.

The show is currently in production on the 17th of the fifth season’s 18 episodes, and is expected to complete filming by mid-March. The suspension suggests that scenes in which he’s already appeared will be removed from the finished episode. And plans called for a wedding between Jamal and his boyfriend Kai, played by Toby Onwumere. (Fox would neither confirm nor deny this storyline).

The show, still popular among young-adult viewers, is expected to be renewed, and returns to Fox’s lineup on March 13 after a winter break. But Smollett’s return to the cast next season is highly uncertain.

The move by Fox came after a damaging day for the 36-year-old star on Thursday, which began when he turned himself in on charges he filed a fake police report and ended with prosecutors stating he plotted the Jan. 29 attack to make himself look like the victim of a brutal anti-black, homophobic crime."

Just ask state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith.

Chicago’s police chief is accusing “Empire” star Jussie Smollett of using the “advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career” by paying two men to stage an attack on him last month.

The allegations concerning Smollett, who is black and gay, sparked an international avalanche of commentary and ignited concerns that reports of the bogus attack could have a chilling effect on victims of hate-related violence.

Smith, an Orlando Democrat who is gay, is turning the controversy into a teachable moment, by sharing his own experience as the survivor of an assault.

While a student at the University of Central Florida, Smith and his friend, Heath Frank, were beaten up at a keg party by a man who repeatedly called his two victims “faggots” after he was arrested, according to a police report.

“I decided to finally tell this very deeply personal story because the reality is that hate crimes are real. Homophobia is real. Bigotry is real. And hate violence is on the rise against many groups. Anti-Semitism is on the rise. Hate violence against transgender women of color is on the rise, especially in Florida,” Smith said in a telephone interview.

Smith took to Twitter on Thursday about his experience as a survivor of “senseless hate violence,” posting a picture of his battered face and a police report of the incident.

The attacker, identified as Eduardo Alessandro Mongio in court documents provided by Smith, was “lingering around” and “acting kind of weird” at a crowded keg party, Smith said.

After beating up Frank, the attacker confronted Smith.

“I didn’t know what was going on. But I got banged up pretty bad. When the dust settled, everyone was telling me about how the guy was making all these homophobic slurs about our group, because hey, listen, we travel in cliques. We queer people, we stick together,” Smith said. “I don’t remember if the guy was drunk or what his deal was, but he started lashing out. It was like a full-fledged gay-bashing.”

Smith said he “felt compelled to speak out” as the controversy around Smollett exploded.

“I don’t know what the outcome is going to become of the Jussie Smollett case. But I can already see there’s a narrative out there that hate crimes aren’t real. No. They are. And they’re on the rise. Especially with the election of Donald Trump, who wears hate for other groups on his sleeve,” he said.

SMOKE ‘EM IF YOU GOT ‘EM

Measures that would allow patients to smoke medical marijuana are headed to the House and Senate floors as legislative leaders iron out differences in their plans.

Lawmakers moved closer to agreement Thursday, after the House Appropriations Committee eliminated a proposal that would have restricted medical marijuana dispensaries to selling pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes with filters.

After making the change, the committee approved the House version of the smokable-marijuana bill (HB 7015). But unlike the Senate’s bill, the House version would not allow dispensaries to sell other whole-flower products.

The Senate proposal (SB 182) would require medical marijuana operators to sell at least one type of pre-rolled, filterless cigarette and allow them to sell other whole-flower products. It also would let patients buy equipment to smoke cannabis products from other retail outlets, such as smoke shops.

The House plan would ban children from smoking, while the Senate measure would allow minors to smoke medical marijuana if patients get a second opinion from a pediatrician.

Both proposals are ready for floor votes after the annual legislative session starts March 5.

Shortly after he was sworn into office last month, Gov. Ron DeSantis gave lawmakers until March 15 to address the smoking issue. If they don’t act, the Republican governor threatened to drop the state’s appeal of a court ruling that said the ban violates a voter-approved constitutional amendment broadly legalizing medical marijuana.

Leaders in both chambers remained confident they would finalize a deal in time to meet the governor’s deadline.

“At each committee stop, I believe the two chambers have moved closer. I think by the time we put the bills on the floor, we will have them aligned,” House sponsor Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, told reporters after Thursday’s meeting.

Rodrigues said he expects the full House to vote on the proposal by the end of the first week of session.

Whether patients under age 18 should be allowed to smoke remains the biggest sticking point for the House, according to Rodrigues.

“We don’t believe children should be smoking medical marijuana,” he said.

The Senate’s biggest issue, meanwhile, is allowing patients to access whole-flower products other than pre-rolled joints.

Rep. Ralph Massullo, a Lecanto Republican who is a dermatologist, pointed out that marijuana is still a Schedule 1 drug under federal law and that a paucity of research exists related to smoking cannabis as a treatment.

By allowing smoking as a route of administration, “we’re basically letting the tail wag the dog,” he warned.

But, said Massullo, “It’s solving problems, and that’s what we need to do.”

“CHOICE” EDUCATION PLANS

Top Senate Republicans on Thursday released details of a package that would bring significant changes to the state’s education system, most notably through an expansion of school choice.

The package would expand private school options for students, bolster security measures in schools and overhaul a program for teacher bonuses.

The series of proposals, which will be filed next week, are aligned with what DeSantis has proposed, including a pitch for a new voucher-type program funded directly with public money rather than through a system that involves corporate tax credits.

The Senate and the Republican governor want to create the voucher program to help reduce a waiting list of roughly 14,000 low-income students in the existing Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program. In that program, corporations receive tax credits for contributions to non-profit organizations, which, in turn, pay for children to go to private schools.

Senate Education Chairman Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said the eligibility requirements between the Senate and the governor’s proposals for the new program are “very similar.” But details will have to be worked out during the legislative session.

“My plan is to provide relief for these kids who are on a waitlist and those parents who want to provide a better education for their child,” Diaz said. “We start with the premise that every child is different … and what works for one child may not work for another.”

Senate Democrats slammed the package for putting taxpayer dollars into a voucher program that benefits private schools.

“The latest move is not only an abandonment of the traditional public-school system in Florida but an abandonment of the constitutional obligation to fully fund a ‘high quality system of free public schools’ that has been built over generations by the people, for the people,” said Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville.

If he faked an assault, he has provided skeptical police officers and unsympathetic right-wingers another excuse not to take such claims seriously.

Smollett — who turned himself in after he was accused of filing a false police report — deserves, like all criminal suspects, the presumption of innocence. His family and his attorneys continue to insist that the actor, who is openly gay, did nothing wrong.

But his story began to fall apart pretty quickly after he made the claim late last month about a vicious attack on a Chicago street as he walked alone late at night. Smollett told police that two masked men punched him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs. He also claimed one yelled, “This is MAGA country!” — invoking President Donald Trump’s signature phrase, “Make America Great Again.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Thursday (Feb. 21) that Smollett paid two men to help him stage the attack.

As feminist writer Roxane Gay tweeted: “Why would he make it harder for people who actually suffer from hate crimes? It makes no sense. The lie is so damaging.”

On cue, Trump quickly jumped in on Twitter, feigning outrage on behalf of all of his supposedly defamed supporters. “@JussieSmollett — what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,” Trump tweeted.

Conservative commentators, some of whom were already openly skeptical of Smollett’s claims, also raced to denounce the actor and his defenders. This case will likely get more attention on right-wing radio talk shows than all the actual cases of hate crimes taken together.

And there are plenty of real hate crimes to keep police busy. Just last week, federal authorities arrested an active-duty U.S. Coast Guard officer, Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, who called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland.” Investigators uncovered a cache of weapons and ammunition at his home, as well as a hit list that read like a who’s who of journalists and Democratic politicians. If notes confiscated from his computer are any guide, Hasson was becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospect that Trump might be impeached and was readying a strike. His Excel spreadsheet, according to published reports, included this chilling tidbit: “best place in dc to see congress people.”

As alarming as this development is, it’s no surprise. Trump has catered to bigots since he started his presidential campaign, and they have felt empowered since his election. He began his political career as the nation’s most famous birther, notoriously insisting that President Barack Obama was a usurper who wasn’t born in this country. He easily segued into a campaign that insulted Mexicans, denounced Muslims and placated white supremacists.

His rallying cry, “Make America Great Again,” is clearly a call for a return to a time when black and brown Americans had little political or economic power and no cultural clout.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such things, the number of hate groups operating in the United States is now at an all-time high; it has identified 1,020 such groups. The Trump presidency has seen, among other assaults, the calamity at Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was fatally struck by a car driven by a white terrorist looking to mow down peaceful protesters, and the atrocity last year at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which left 11 worshippers dead.

Smollett may have seen an opportunity in linking his allegedly fake claim to an actual perpetrator: a president who has continually engaged in hateful and divisive rhetoric that stirs up the lunatic element among his supporters. If Smollett lied, he has only assisted the hater in chief.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was clearly outraged when he held a news conference to announce the charges against Jussie Smollett for filing a false police report. Besides the demands on scarce Chicago Police Department resources, Johnson was angry at the chilling effect Smollett’s lies would have on future victims.

Hate crime reporting is increasing, but there’s no way to tease out from the available statistics whether hate crimes are increasing, reporting is improving or even whether all reported incidents actually occurred. Most news accounts have included some variation of a factoid saying “reported hate crimes rose from 2016 to 2017, according to new data released by the FBI.” It makes a great sound bite but it’s radically incomplete without context.

While the FBI is mandated by the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to collect data, agency reporting is voluntary and fluctuates. An additional 1,000 agencies reported data to the FBI in 2017 compared to 2016. Clearly if more agencies are reporting, there will be more reports. Broad year-to-year comparisons provide little useful data unless the subject is the hate crime reporting system itself.

But what exactly is a hate crime? The definition varies, making accurate data collection even more difficult. In Washington and Idaho, “malicious harassment” statutes cover crimes driven by a perception of the target as belonging to a recognized victim group.

FBI methodology relies on an underlying crime being committed, with biased motives adding penalties. The 1990 act called out “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” Congress added people with disabilities to the list in 1994. The law was revised again by the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 after two particularly evil attacks drove Congress to do something.

“Just do something” reactions to tragedy often don’t do much. Naming a bill for two men brutally murdered honored them in death but didn’t change the outcome. Is a brutal murder committed by a cold-blooded psychopath somehow less worse? Less tragic? Less fatal?

The 1969 Charles Manson murders were shocking because they had no apparent motive. The nine murders carried out by his cult followers wouldn’t fit the definition of a hate crime. And after 16 months of investigation, the FBI still has found no evidence of motive for Steven Paddock’s killing spree in Las Vegas in 2017. In some ways, violent crime without an element of hate is creepier. Crime is crime, whether motivated by hate or greed or fame or money or thrills.

Not everyone agrees hate crime is a useful statutory distinction. According to a 1998 book review of “Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics” by James Jacobs and Kimberly Potter as published in the National Catholic Register, “rather than fostering a more tolerant society, the hate crime concept often solidifies attitudes one would hope to change.”

On May 11, 2018, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held a full day forum titled “In the Name of Hate: Examining the Federal Government’s Role in Responding to Hate Crimes.” Panel No. 1 included representatives from the Boston and Seattle police departments, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, an attorney from the Department of Justice and a journalist discussing local law enforcement outreach and policing practices.

Chief Marc Garth Green described Seattle’s municipal protections for perceived homelessness, marital status and political ideology. In addition to malicious harassment, Seattle also tracks “crimes with bias elements” where derogatory language is used unrelated to the crime and “noncriminal bias” incidents. Those are defined as “using derogatory language but not in a criminal nature at home.” Bad language incidents are increasing, malicious harassment is not. Panelist Robby Souave of Reason magazine urged caution in policing speech. Criminal activity must be pursued and prosecuted, but “First Amendment freedoms are often the first casualty of government-led efforts to crack down on undesirable behavior.”

After hearing all about law enforcement best practices, Commissioner Peter Kirsanow asked the panel a critical question. Were they aware of any data, studies or other evidence demonstrating that designation as a hate crime aids in apprehension or prevents crime? The answer was silence.

But at least we can say we’re doing something. Even if it’s not much."

I am not referring to the Jussie Smollett saga, but to the “historic” sex abuse summit at the Vatican.

This summit was promulgated not by a crisis of consciousness or divine inspiration, but by the immense financial toll and social pressure that has been exerted upon the Catholic Church by victims’ advocacy groups and law enforcement agencies. The church has never once confessed to as-yet undiscovered crimes against children, nor should anyone expect it to ever do so.

Pope Francis waxes poetic about “transparency,” but that word means more than admitting guilt only after you’ve been caught. True salvation (for both victims and wrongdoers) will only come when the Vatican opens up its entire child sex abuse archives to unfettered secular scrutiny, releases those findings to the public, and then willingly accepts whatever legal and financial consequences come of it. Anything less would be un-Christian.

Cops in schools need calm and empathy

Matthew Hendrickson’s article on the student who was assaulted by Chicago police officers at Marshall High School points out an important concern. The article quotes the family’s attorney as saying “…there needs to be a better vetting system for police officers who work in schools.”

Every adult in a school must understand that his/her role is “in loco parentis” — that is, in place of parents. All of the adults working in CPS must be able to see the children in the school as their own, and behave accordingly. Would that officer have punched or Tasered his own daughter?

Another question is whether police officers, trained to deal with crime and criminals, are suitable candidates for employment in schools. At the least, they require special training for these very different situations.

I know times are somewhat different, but when I was a Hyde Park High School senior, I worked security during my free period. A 5’4″, 99 pound, 16-year-old girl, I was stationed outside the lunchroom. I respectfully insisted on the rules being followed and received respectful compliance. Even then, I knew showing aggression towards an upset person would be counter-productive. Calm and empathy are required. Police officers might consider my proven methods.

Jussie Smollett should do some time

Now with Jussie Smollett being charged and arrested for filing a false police report (class 4 felony) with a fake hate crime, he should face some jail time when and if convicted.

He lied to the police and wasted hundreds of hours of police work/resources and cost the city thousands of dollars. So if people are going to prison for lying to Congress or the FBI, Smollett should face the same consequences for his actions.

According to TMZ, after the Empire star surrendered to police Thursday (Feb. 21), he confessed that he has an addiction to ecstasy and that he has never sought help for it. Based on text messages recovered by police, Smollett had been buying drugs from Abel Osundario, one of the brothers that participated in the staged Jan. 29th attack in Chicago, since 2018. This can play a role in his case and possibly get his sentence reduced.

The 36-year-old was charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false report after Abel and his brother, Ola, revealed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to participate in a fake hate crime to a grand jury. They also admitted to rehearsing the attack with him and even picking out the spot where the attack would take place. After the attack the brothers went home to Nigeria that same day. Smollett allegedly knew that trip had already been planned, hence why he picked that day for the attack.

Smollett allegedly staged the attack because he was unhappy with his salary as Jamal on Empire. He reportedly rakes in $65,000 an episode, summing up to $1.2 million a year. It was found that Smollett knew the Osundario brothers quite well, but had a closer relationship with Abel, who had also served as his personal trainer. Smollett and his legal team have denied all of these claims.

During the “attack,” Smollett told police that he had been physically attacked while going home at 2:00 a.m by two men who beat him, poured what was believed to be bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and called him racial and gay slurs.

Smollett was released on $100,000 bond last Thursday. He will enter his plea during his next court appearance on March 14th. He is facing three years in prison."

If you only got your news from MSNBC’s primetime lineup, however, you probably had no idea what even happened in the first place.

On Jan. 29, Smollett claimed to have been the victim of a hate crime perpetrated by two presumable supporters of President Donald Trump shouting “This is MAGA country” as they placed a noose around his neck.

Many elected Democrats and denizens of the liberal media, especially at MSNBC, dove headfirst into the story and pushed the allegations far and wide as confirmed fact.

However, the resultant investigation by the Chicago Police Department determined that the entire ordeal was an elaborate hoax dreamed up by Smollett himself, and he was charged with a felony on Wednesday for filing a false report, followed by an arrest and arraignment hearing on Thursday morning.

Fox News reported Friday that the entire lineup of MSNBC’s primetime hosts completely avoided mentioning that news — or even mentioning Smollett at all — on Wednesday and Thursday evening, despite both CNN and Fox News providing ample coverage of the shocking developments for their viewers, albeit from different perspectives.

Driving that point home quite savagely was a graphic found at the top of the Fox News website homepage, which sharply criticized the rival network by using the MSNBC letters and logo to spell out “Mr. Smollett Not Being Covered.”

That point is rather valid, however, as MSNBC’s four primetime hosts — Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell and Brian Williams — all avoided even mentioning Smollett’s name once on Wednesday and Thursday, much less share the stunning details of the 180 degree turn his story had made.

Their silence was particularly odd in light of the fact that they had all been regularly covering the story over the past three weeks, in addition to the fact that daytime anchors and pundits on the network had discussed the latest developments.

Indeed, one daytime guest reportedly even sought to defend Smollett by suggesting the Chicago police were Trump supporters themselves who were simply lying about Smollett in an effort to frame the outspoken critic of the president.

Instead of covering the breaking Smollett news, however, the primetime hosts spent time talking about other issues like fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe’s recent commentary, Roger Stone’s pending legal trouble, the ongoing Robert Mueller special counsel probe and other stories that portrayed President Trump in a negative light.

“To downplay or ignore the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax charges is a politically biased journalistic choice,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William Jacobson told Fox News. “The Smollett case represents the collapse of a cherished MSNBC false narrative, that Trump supporters supposedly are racist, homophobic and violent.”

Jacobson’s take was echoed by DePauw University professor and media analyst Jeffrey McCall, who told Fox News that while “the Smollett matter is not widely significant compared to international affairs, the economy and political failures in Congress” in the big scheme of things, it nevertheless warranted coverage from MSNBC.

RELATED: Pro-Trump, Pro-Life Pastor Leads in the Bluest Congressional District in America

“The media latched on to the Smollett situation and told the nation that this story was huge because of the broader socio-cultural issues involved,” McCall said.

“Given that the Smollett matter has been so much in the news over the last several weeks, it seems curious that MSNBC would fail to provide suitable coverage in primetime when the Chicago police provide the latest development,” McCall added. “And it’s not like there was a ton of other breaking and high-impact stories happening yesterday that would have squeezed Smollett developments off the agenda.”

Amber Athey, editor and reporter for The Daily Caller, noted that even though MSNBC’s Twitter account was covering the breaking news on Wednesday and Thursday, that didn’t let the network’s primetime hosts off the hook for not covering the story as well.

“Fox News and CNN also repeatedly led with Smollett’s charges and arrest during their primetime shows because they recognize that this is a story that captured the nation,” Athey said. “MSNBC is free to choose what they want to cover, but their decision to completely ignore one of the biggest stories in the country involving the intersection of race and politics suggests they’re operating with a severe bias.”

The refusal of MSNBC’s primetime hosts to cover a story that didn’t turn out the way they likely wanted only serves to underscore the deep-seated biases they maintain, and Fox News deserves kudos for calling out the blatant and glaring oversight of that network’s hosts with the hilarious graphic posted at the top of their website homepage.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has spoken out against Jussie Smollett after the “Empire” actor was charged by police for allegedly filing a false police report.

“Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I’m sad, frustrated, and disappointed,” Harris said in a statement posted Thursday on Twitter. “When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward.”

https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1098724827869995009

The presidential candidate also highlighted the rise in hate crimes in recent years, which she said was muddled by the recent Smollett scandal.

“Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from the truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address,” she wrote. “We should not allow that.”

“I will always condemn racism and homophobia,” she continued. “We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice. That is what I will keep fighting for.”

Chicago police charged Smollett on Wednesday with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report after he told police on Jan. 29 that he had been attacked by two men who poured bleach on him and put a rope around his neck after using racial and homophobic slurs. Investigators now believe Smollett paid acquaintances Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to help him stage the attack.

Soon after, Smollett surrendered to authorities and was arrested early Thursday morning in Chicago. He could face one to three years in prison, if convicted of the felony charge.

Previously, Harris tweeted her support of Smollett, calling the attack a “modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” she wrote. “We must confront this hate.”

Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr imposed a bond of $250,000 for each of the four women the embattled R&B singer, real name Robert Sylvester Kelly, is accused of abusing.

He will be able to post just 10 percent of the bond amount - $100,000 - to be released under the D-bond.

Kelly's lawyers had asked for a lower bond amount, arguing that the defendant's finances are a mess in part because he was recently dropped by his record label.

He also had to surrender his passport even though his attorney, Steve Greenberg, said Kelly is not a flight risk, telling the judge: 'Contrary to the song, Mr Kelly doesn’t like to fly.'

Bond was set after prosecutors laid out the stunning allegations against Kelly in graphic detail. Three of the four cases involved women who were underage.

Kelly reported kept his eyes locked on the courtroom floor and looked dejected as Judge Lyke Jr called the allegations 'disturbing'.

After the hearing, Cook County state's attorney Kimberly Foxx addressed the press and provided additional details on each of the indictments.

The first victim, identified as H.W., allegedly met Kelly when she was celebrating her 16th birthday and his manager gave her the artist's card.

The victim's mother approached the manager and informed him that the girl was only 16. The girl later took the card out of her mother's purse and contacted Kelly, who told her to skip school and come to his studio, Foxx said.

The pair allegedly had regular sexual contact including oral and vaginal intercourse about once a month between May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999. Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

The second indictment is based on a disturbing video purportedly showing Kelly have sex with a 14-year-old girl identified as R.L., in an incident that took place between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001.

That incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

The allegations came to light in 2001 when a witness having a conversation with Kelly and his associates was asked to retrieve video showing the artist having sexual intercourse with the victim. The witness turned the video over to police.

The third indictment with one count of aggravated sexual assault involved a 24-year-old hairdresser, identified as L.W., who was hired to braid Kelly's hair.

Prosecutors say that on February 18, 2003, Kelly told the woman that he didn't want her to braid his hair but wanted a head massage as he exposed his penis to her.

He then allegedly grabbed her head and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. When she resisted, Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face several times, prosecutors said. Kelly's DNA was recovered from the alleged victim's shirt.

The fourth victim, identified as J.P., met Kelly when she asked for his autograph while attending his 2008 trial on child pornography charges.

According to an indictment detailing three counts of aggravated sexual assault, the pair engaged in oral and vaginal sex between a period from May 2009 to January 2010. She was between 13 and 17 at the time.

Prosecutors say Kelly would often spit on the victim, slap her in the face, choke her and ejaculate on her. She saved a shirt from one of the incidents and turned it over to police, who found a DNA match to Kelly.

If convicted on all 10 counts, Kelly could face up to 70 years behind bars. His arraignment has been scheduled for February 28.

Kelly surrendered to police in Chicago on Friday night after a warrant was issued for his arrest

Kelly arrived in a black van at the 1st District Chicago police station around 8pm CST. The singer did not respond as reporters shouted questions at him

Kelly was led inside the station, handcuffed by police, and led away for booking

Kelly surrendered on Friday night at the 1st District Chicago police station, hours after the Cook County State's Attorney office issued a no bail warrant for his arrest.

In a booking photo released by the Chicago Police Department early Saturday, Kelly can be seen wearing a basic black hooded sweatshirt and an exhausted expression.

Kelly arrived at the station in a large black van with tinted windows at around 8pm CST. He exited the vehicle wearing a puffy blue coat, entered the station house, was handcuffed and led away.

The 52-year-old did not respond as reporters shouted questions, including: 'Are you innocent?' and 'How do you explain the video?'

In response to a question about what he had to say 'to the black women of Chicago,' Kelly's attorney shot back: 'That's an offensive question.'

Following Kelly's arrest, his attorney Steve Greenberg addressed reporters outside the station.

He said that several of the charges are 'double jeopardy' because they 'involve the same girl' that Kelly was acquitted of producing child pornography with in 2008.

Greenberg went on to say that all of the accusations against Kelly, including those in the recent documentary Surviving R Kelly, are false.

'I think all the women are lying, yes. This has become: ""Hey I can say R Kelly did something."" Boom,' the lawyer said. '""Oh I met R Kelly once, he looked at me the wrong way."" Boom, money.'

Greenberg also blasted celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti, who said last week that he had turned over to prosecutors damning video evidence of Kelly performing sex acts on a 14-year-old girl.

'I haven't seen Avenatti's tape,' Greenberg said. 'I wonder why [prosecutor] Kim Foxx isn't investigating him for disseminating child porn and watching child porn, which I'm sure he's done many times.'

Avenatti blasted back minutes later on Twitter: 'Steve Greenberg is exactly what R Kelly deserves. Happy to be living rent free in this guy's head.'

R KELLY INDICTMENTS Robert Sylvester Kelly, 52, was indicted on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims on Friday, February 22 in Chicago. VICTIM 1 - H.W., 16 years old Regular sexual contact between May 1998 to May 1999

Four counts of aggravated sexual assault Kelly allegedly met H.W. when she was celebrating her 16th birthday and his manager gave her the artist's card, according to Cook County state attorney Kimberly Foxx. The victim's mother approached the manager and informed him that the girl was only 16. The girl later took the card out of her mother's purse and contacted Kelly, who told her to skip school and come to his studio, Foxx said.

VICTIM 2 - R.L., 14 years old Once incident between September 1998 to September 2001

Two counts of aggravated sexual assault The second indictment is based on a disturbing video purportedly showing Kelly have sex with a 14-year-old girl identified as R.L., in an incident that allegedly took place between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001. The allegations came to light in 2001 when a witness having a conversation with Kelly and his associates was asked to retrieve video showing the artist having sexual intercourse with the victim, Foxx said. The witness turned the video over to police. VICTIM 3 - L.W., 24 years old One incident on February 18, 2003

One count of aggravated sexual assault Prosecutors say L.W. had been hired to braid Kelly's hair on February 18, 2003, and when the singer showed up for his appointment he allegedly told the 24-year-old that he didn't want her to braid his hair but wanted a head massage as he exposed his penis to her. He then allegedly grabbed her head and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. When she resisted, Kelly ejaculated on her and spit in her face several times, prosecutors said. Kelly's DNA was recovered from the victim's shirt. VICTIM 4 - J.P., under 17 years old Repeated sexual contact between May 2009 and January 2010

Three counts of aggravated sexual assault J.P. allegedly met Kelly when she asked for his autograph while attending his 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges. According to an indictment detailing three counts of aggravated sexual assault, the pair engaged in oral and vaginal sex between a period from May 1, 2009 to January 31, 2010. Kelly allegedly spat on the victim, slapped her in the face and ejaculated on her. The victim brought a T-shirt with his semen on it when she reported the alleged abuse to police. If convicted on all 10 counts, Kelly could face up to 70 years behind bars. His arraignment has been scheduled for February 28. R Kelly has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. Advertisement

Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg denied the charges against his client after he turned himself in on Friday night. Greenberg told reporters that 'all the women are lying'

Upon news of his arrest, some of Kelly's accusers spoke out to express their gratitude.

'When I first heard the news, I started crying because it was tears of joy,' Asante McGee told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

She appeared in the Surviving R Kelly docuseries, in which she accused the singer of holding her in a Georgia home and abusing her six years ago - allegations that are unrelated to the criminal charges Kelly faces in Chicago.

'To know that we finally got an indictment after two decades, after him getting away with the allegations, it was a joyous moment for me,' McGee said. 'Just knowing the things that he was doing to those young girls was really sickening.'

In a statement, Kelly's attorney said the singer is 'shell-shocked' by the sex abuse charges.

Kelly has previously denied all allegations of assault and abuse through his lawyer.

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of three to seven years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

Got him: The incidents allegedly took place between 1998 and 2010, and is unclear if the grand jury is done hearing testimony and evidence in the case (Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx at a press conference on Friday)

Back to court: R Kelly (above at his 2008 trial) has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse by the Cook County State's Attorney's office

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

This comes just one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report in a suspected hate hoax.

The same judge overseeing that case, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, has been assigned to Kelly's case.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

The alleged rape tape was submitted to the State's Attorney's Office last week by Michael Avenatti.

At the time, Avenatti said that he believed it showed Kelly and an underage minor whose age he guessed to be 14.

CNN then watched the tape as well, despite the fact that it is a federal crime to watch child pornography.

When asked if either party might be investigated for these actions, an FBI spokesperson declined to comment.

R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving several victims including minors. He is seen above performing in 2016

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.

Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday.

His manager however found himself in trouble with the law days after the series premired.

A police report filed in Georgia reveals that Don Russell texted and called Timothy Savage, the father of one of the alleged victims, to say it 'would be best for him and his family if the documentary does not air.'

Russell later said that he and Kelly might have to release information that would destroy Savage, his family and his business.

Savage and his wife Jonelyn have been trying for years to get back their daughter Jocelyn, who ran off to be with Kelly shortly after meeting him backstage at a concert when she was only 17.

They believe that she is being held captive but the singer, but both Kelly and Jocelyn deny this is the case.

The report states that Savage called police shortly after 5am on the day of the incident.

The responding officer then arrived at the house before 5.45am, which is when Russell called Savage on the phone.

Savage was then able to put the phone on speaker so that the officer could hear everything that was being said by Russell.

'Don says several times that Timothy is providing Lifetime with false information, and that is he continues supporting the documentary that they (R Kelly / Don) would be forced to release information disproving Don,' reads the report.

'Don advised Timothy that the information would ruin him, his reputation, business and family, because it would show him a liar.'

This is actually the second time one of the singer's managers has threatened Savage, who previously filed a police report against James Mason.

There is now an outstanding warrant for Mason after he failed to respond to police when they asked to question him about the 'threats' he made to Savage.

The Savages first spoke out in an interview with BuzzFeed on in 2017 which contained worrying allegations that Kelly had been holding a handful of young women in cult like conditions and effectively treating them as his sexual slaves for years.

Some former members of his entourage vouched for their concern. Three separate women said they were all forced to subscribe to his rules.

They said they were told when to eat, bathe, sleep and had to perform sexual acts on one another which the singer then recorded.

Savage's mother recalled painstakingly how she was present when her daughter met the singer as an aspiring musician herself after being invited backstage to a concert in 2015.

It's not clear exactly when Jocelyn went to live with Kelly but her family say they have not seen her since December 2017. 'It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,' her mother said.

The mother-of-three boasted about meeting the star again in January 2016. On Facebook, she posed with Jocelyn and the star along with one other women, telling friends how they were 'in the studio'.

In her BuzzFeed interview, she said she thought it would be 'fine' for her daughter to spend time with the star if she was there to watch over her.

Jocelyn's father Timothy believes she is suffering Stockholm Syndrome, a condition which sees hostages grow to love their captors.

The family contacted police after their daughter fled to live with the singer and told officers how he was running a 'cult'.

Police visited the home where they said she was but it was empty. They then tracked her down in Chicago but she said she was fine and wanted to be left alone by her family.

Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee - all former members of Kelly's entourage - described in detail the sort of treatment endured by young women who find themselves pulled into the singer's orbit.

A representative for Kelly spoke out at the time about the claims, saying the singer 'unequivocally denies' them and said he will 'work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and to clear his name'.

Earlier, Mack, Jones, and McGee said there are at least six women living in properties rented by the R&B star in Chicago and Atlanta. The 'guest houses' where the women are kept are near his home in suburban Atlanta, and his apartment at Trump Tower in Chicago.

'You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom… [Kelly] is a master at mind control... He is a puppet master,' Mack, who worked as the singer's assistant, told the website.

The women, who said the 'babies' - as the girls are referred to - are required to call Kelly 'Daddy', then ran through a list of people they believe were living either at one of the performer's properties in Atlanta or his Chicago recording studio last summer.

The first woman mentioned in the article was a 31-year-old 'den mother', who is reportedly responsible for 'training newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually'.

The 'den mother' 'had been best friends since high school' with the person who was allegedly in the videotape that led to Kelly standing trial on child pornography charges in 2008.

Mack said many of the young women are sucked in by the singer because they think: 'This is R Kelly, I'm going to live a lavish lifestyle'.

In addition to the aforementioned control Kelly has, he allegedly demands the women ask his permission before leaving a room, are forced to wear jogging suits in public in order to keep their figures hidden, have their phones taken and are given new ones that are only allowed to be used to contact him or others approved by him, and have to deal with a 'burly' SUV driver parked outside his properties.

Both Mack and Jones said that if any of the women break the 'rules', Kelly 'punishes them physically and verbally'. Jones recounted a time she angered Kelly by 'being too friendly' with the male cashier.

'I got trapped. I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I'm talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls,' said Jones.

McGee added: 'R Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet. But Robert is the devil.'"

New reports have surfaced on the possible true motivation behind Jussie’s alleged hoax rollout.

Sources close to the “Empire” production tell TMZ … some cast members think Jussie’s gears started grinding in his head days after Lee posted a video on Instagram on January 10 calling out homophobia. In that same post, the “Empire” creator captioned it, “This past week my cousin was beat up for being gay and I am sick of hearing these stories.” (TMZ)

Last month, Daniels came forward to share a video about his cousin’s homophobic attack.

Earlier this week, G-Unit boss 50 Cent ripped Daniels over speaking up for Jussie following his initial assault.

According to reports, Jussie’s Jamal Lyon character will noticeably fade away from the upcoming season’s final episodes."

Jussie, real name Justin, hired two Nigerian black guys to play the parts of two white guys, and to pretend to beat him up a bit.

This may seem strange, and is .

He then claimed that two white guys did this, 'that and the other' to him, from a white perspective, which then involved the police, and the internet. Things were already starting to spin out of his control.

When the black guys started to talk about events, however, the plan started to unravel. Forgetting to ask them not to talk about the arrangement, seems to have been his second mistake.

Then Mr. Smollett's attorney, Bob Shitt, showed up, and spoke on his behalf, as they tend to do, even defending murderers they know are guilty. Shitt made the mistake of swimming, salmon-like, against the tide, and calling claims that his client had fabricated the whole incident ""despicable"".

Smollett divulged his ‘drug problem’ after turning himself in Thursday morning on charges that he filed a police report for a Jan. 29 hate crime hoax he allegedly paid to associates to act out.

Smollett fingered Abimbola “Abel” Osundario – one of the two brothers the ‘Empire’ star allegedly paid $3,500 to beat him up – as his drug dealer, selling him ‘Molly’ several times since the spring of 2018 according to text messages.

Police say Smollett text messaged Osundario asking for the drug – a street name for ecstacy.



Tom Pappert breaks down the mixed reactions coming from inside Fox’s Empire television set yesterday and reveals what the cast and crew really thinks about their coworker’s hate crime hoax.

Word of Smollett’s drug problem comes as TVLine reports ‘Empire‘ producers are considering bringing in a new actor to play the role of Jamal. Co-creator Lee Daniels – who reportedly loosely based the character on himself, is said to be a big fan of the idea.

20th Century Fox said on Friday that while they will wait for the legal process to play out, they “have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Smollett was arrested early Thursday after turning himself in on a felony criminal charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in connection with the hate crime ‘attack.’

And in a sign that the left has finally accepted the situation, the Daily Show mocked the Smollett situation on Friday:

Attorneys for the actor, who was arrested for allegedly fabricating a hate crime against himself in Chicago last month, are slamming the case as a “spectacle” and have refused to retract their client’s assertion that he is truly the victim, the Washington Examiner reported.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,” the legal team said in a statement.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” the statement said.

The 36-year-old actor was arrested Thursday for disorderly conduct and for filing a false police report in last month’s alleged assault in which he claimed two men had attacked him, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck, while yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him.

Smollett and his attorneys have denied all the allegations against him. A judge granted $100,000 bail, and Smollett paid a $10,000 bond, at his court appearance.

His attorneys’ defiant comments appeared to be a rebuke of Chicago law enforcement after Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson leveled a blistering statement about Smollett in a press conference after his arrest.

“’Empire’ actor Jussie took advantage of the pain and racism to promote his own career. I am left hanging my head and asking why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson said.

The remarks by Smollett’s attorneys also alluded to the heated Chicago mayoralty race which they claimed is smearing the actor’s “impeccable character” to score political points in the campaign set to replace outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

“All across Chicago, in every neighborhood, there are signs in front yards and windows that read, ‘Hate Has No Home Here.’ It is a sign that expresses our shared values and defines our great city,” Emanuel said in a statement following the police press conference. “Our laws exist to reflect and defend those values, and hate crimes will never be tolerated.”

“A single individual who put their perceived self-interest ahead of these shared principles will never trump Chicago’s collective spirit,” he added.

Meanwhile, Smollett’s “Empire” role has been suspended according to the show’s executives.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the show’s co-creators, Lee Daniels and Brett Mahoney and executive producers Danny Strong, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer, told Fox News.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement said."

""All he did was think of himself,"" she said. ""What about our kids? If one of them gets shot or harassed... do you think the police are going to come out here and help? The answer was no and is still no.""

Chicago police charged Smollett this week with filing a false report for allegedly staging a Jan. 29 attack on himself and making it look like he was the victim of a hate crime. Smollett has denied the charge.

The 36-year-old actor, who is black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him last month. He said they threw bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and said it was ""MAGA"" country, referring to President Trump's supporters, during the assault.

On Friday, producers of ""Empire,"" which airs on Fox, announced they would remove Smollett's character ""Jamal"" from the last two episodes of the current season.

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S 'EMPIRE' ROLE CUT FROM SEASON'S FINAL EPISODES, CREATORS SAY

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson slammed the tv star Thursday calling the Smollett saga ""simply shameful."" Johnson, who has spent three decades as a police officer, was asked to lead the department in 2016 after former top cop Garry McCarthy was fired following the release of dashcam footage showing a white police officer fatally shooting a black teenager 16 times in less than 30 seconds. The incident prompted widespread protests across the city.

""I know the racial divide that exists here,"" Johnson said. ""I know how hard it's been for our city and our nation to come together. And I also know the disparities and I know the history. 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism.""

Carmia Tang, whose son Jeremy Alexander Tang, was murdered in Chicago on Sept. 3, 2017, is frustrated by the coverage Smolett's case has received.

""My son was shot and killed in Chicago - where is his national media attention?"" she asked.

There are 700 unsolved murders in Chicago.

""If Jussie Smollett lied, he has wasted tons of taxpayer dollars and extremely valuable police time – and should be prosecuted to the fullest,"" she said. ""Police resources were used for an awful hoax instead of an unsolved case like Jeremy's.""

Still, Myles Brady Davis, a spokesman for Equality Illinois, told Fox News he holds out hope that the Smollett situation will bring attention to hate crimes in Chicago.

""LGBTQ people of color in particular, are aware of the very real threat hate crimes pose to our community,"" he said in a written statement.

According to the most recent FBI data available, there were 41 hate crimes in Chicago in 2017. Of those, 8 victims were targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and 16 were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.

""In no way should we be allowing the events taking place to distract us from the real and pervasive challenges that the LGBTQ community faces on a daily basis,"" Channyn Lynne Parker, transgender community advocate, told Fox.

But from the moment Jupiter, Florida, police identified the New England Patriots owner as part of a sting operation investigating possible human trafficking, it was apparent that Kraft’s mere presence in the matter is already responsible for staining the NFL’s so-called “shield.”

Nearly three weeks ago, Kraft basked in the glory of yet another Super Bowl crown for the Patriots. Last weekend, he rolled with the ballers and rappers during NBA All-Star Weekend.

Now he’s the biggest name to be released so far by police, who declared Friday that they have video evidence that proves the Patriots owner, 77, twice paid for sexual acts.

No, it’s not good for the brand when the owner of the NFL’s most successful organization of this era attracts such scandalous attention, lining up in the news cycle on Friday – and likely for weeks beyond – with the likes of Jussie Smollett, R. Kelly and his Oval Office pal, President Donald Trump.

Say it ain’t so, Bob.

Sure, Kraft is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We’ll see if the charges – which in addition to fines carry a maximum of 60 days in jail for a first offense, one year for a second offense – hold up in court.

Yet Kraft’s stellar reputation, linked to the image-conscious sports league that is more popular than any, instantly took a significant blow that threatens to become part of his legacy.

A spokesman for Kraft quickly responded as such: “We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we are not commenting further.”

And there’s this statement from league headquarters: “The NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.”

KRAFT:What we know about Patriots owner's prostitution solicitation charges

Let’s remember, when it comes to NFL matters, there are two courts of law to consider: The jurisprudence of the land and Roger Goodell’s court.

The two are supposedly mutually exclusive, yet they're intertwined in the reality that Goodell’s credibility – with damage already inflicted on the league’s reputation – suddenly faces another challenge in how he handles the case of one of the NFL’s most respected power brokers and one of his biggest personal supporters.

This is why the commissioner gets paid the big bucks: Protect the shield.

Goodell did some splendid dancing on behalf of his bosses, the NFL owners, when it came to repeatedly defending the league in the recently settled collusion case stemming from the apparent blackballing of Colin Kaepernick.

KAEPERNICK:Justice won’t be done until he’s on a roster

Alternatively, Goodell dropped the hammer on Jim Irsay in 2014, suspending him for six games and fining him the maximum amount of $500,000 after the Indianapolis Colts owner pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was found to possess controlled substances.

And he stood his ground against Kraft and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the Deflategate case. Ordered an investigation into the workplace misconduct allegations that led to then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson quickly selling the franchise. Went toe-to-toe with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in suspending Ezekiel Elliott for violating the conduct policy amid domestic violence allegations against the running back.

So, Goodell’s track record on personal conduct matters – as a number of current and former players will attest – suggests that he’ll take action against Kraft. Yet if he does, the key will be the swiftness and substance of any such move.

The NFL’s personal conduct policy clearly states this much: ""Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline when violations of the Personal Conduct Policy occur.""

Now Goodell can define those words in real time.

Kraft deserves his due process but not a double standard. In fact, as the NFL’s conduct policy states, he deserves to be subject to a higher standard.

Can Kraft be placed on some version of the “commissioner’s exempt list” and removed from day-to-day involvement with the Patriots and NFL while he tries to legally clear his name?

That would represent a strong statement from Goodell. After all, with the charges against Kraft coming from the law enforcement community the NFL embraces, this is not a he-said, she-said civil suit.

Yet I wonder if Kraft’s immense collateral equity, if you will, will play a role in how Goodell responds.

Multiple reports said that Kraft, after all, urged Trump to help seal the deal that allowed Canadian broadcasters to sell their own Super Bowl ads, which the NFL pursued for years to no avail. He was also the NFL owner who probably had the biggest influence in striking the labor deal in 2011 that ended the lockout, while his wife, Myra, was in the final stages of battling the ovarian cancer that took her life. And when pondering the impact of a community-minded team like the Patriots, Kraft is some kind of legend – the former season-ticket holder who saved the franchise from moving from the region, the whiz who hired Bill Belichick.

Kraft’s narrative, though, has suddenly expanded in the worst way – as something fresh to come across Goodell’s desk, something suddenly attached to the sports environment and a legal matter to boot.

It was strange to see a professional talking head on ESPN state at least a half-dozen times in a matter of minutes Friday how “uncomfortable” it was to discuss Kraft in this vein.

That’s like the “we never imagined it could happen here” soundbites you hear when tragedy strikes in particular neighborhoods. Unfortunately, sports and society are interwoven. There have been so many examples of NFL figures – in many cases, players – being involved in all sorts of off-the-field issues for which the talking heads don’t use “uncomfortable” to preface the analysis.

Something happened. Kraft is on full blast, like players, coaches and all sorts of public figures. It’s the world we live in. Unfortunate, but not “uncomfortable” to ponder that.

How about the comforting thought that Kraft needs to be held to a higher standard – and maybe for his own good, too.

Maher began by telling the panel that Smollett “wanted to be the victim” and what it says about America is that “there’s nothing more powerful than being a victim,” which he thought was a big problem.

“I feel like we’ve gone from this place where I hear people say, ‘Victims should be believed.’ Victims should be taken seriously. Victims should not always be believed,” Maher said. “Take you seriously - that’s a big difference, but we seem to have skipped that step because we always do.”

JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S ALLEGED HOAX GOT MORE MEDIA ATTENTION THAN MY SON, WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN CHICAGO

The HBO star later mocked Smollett, saying he’s “not a good actor” judging from his interview on “Good Morning America.”

Former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile blasted the TV star for allegedly fabricating a hate crime in order to increase his salary.

“No one wants to be the victim of hate crimes. No one wants to be the victim of being attacked and brutalized because you’re gay or you’re black or you’re Jewish. That’s bulls**t,” Brazile exclaimed. “He wanted a pay raise and he wanted to bring attention to himself. I’m angry with him, I’m upset with him, and he owes not only the city of Chicago an apology- there are real-live victims out there today and I refuse to shut up because he played a terrible game and it’s painful.”

In that interview, published on the 15th of February 2019, Jussie detailed the night of his attack. He said the attack happened at about 2am as he was leaving a Subway Restaurant in Chicago.



According to him, the two attackers got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, and they put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him.



When asked why he hesitated to call the police. He responded by saying, “there’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man you’re considered to be somehow weak. And I’m not weak; we [the gay community] are not weak. I’m glad that Frank reported it.” This was at the center of all he said throughout the interview: his pride, how society considers gay people and his empowerment of gay men. What he didn’t, however, add was that any of it be done by violence.



ABC News’ Robin Roberts asked him what he would say to a young gay man and this was his answer: “learn to fight; learn to be a fighter. I’m not advocating violence…”



The two attackers, in a new twist to the case, have alleged that Jussie Smollett paid them to orchestrate and stage the attack on him. According to them, Smollett was upset that the threatening letter sent to Empire studios didn’t receive enough attention. Jussie’s attorney in response to this new twist said: ‘Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he’s familiar with. He [Jussie Smollett] has now been victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’ The threatening letter is now gaining serious attention as journalists are asking whether he sent them himself.



Today on ABC News, the police released a formal statement calling Jussie Smollett’s attack fake. He’s been charged a felony, for filing a fake report.

Fox officials released a statement after Smollett’s arrest that they were “evaluating the situation and … considering our options,” and sources say those options include keeping Smollett’s character in the script for the season five finale or writing him out of it.

The drama series is currently filming the penultimate episode of season five, and sources tell TMZ Smollett was shooting scenes for that episode Thursday. Those sources also say the actor begged the cast and crew to believe that he did not fake an attack on himself Jan. 29, as he is charged with doing. “I’m sorry I’ve put you all through this and not answered any calls,” he reportedly said. “You know me, I would never do this to any of you, you are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.”

Smollett’s legal team released a new statement Thursday night, following a day in which police released a detailed account of what they say Smollett did: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.” Also Thursday, TMZ reported that Smollett told police during his arrest that he has a drug problem that’s never been treated. Police say Smollett bought ecstasy from one of the brothers he allegedly hired to stage the attack, and TMZ says “a drug issue could be a mitigating factor that gets his sentenced reduced” if he’s convicted."

It has been painful to watch the downfall of the actor Jussie Smollett.

By now, you are familiar with his story. In January he claimed to have been attacked by two Trump supporters on a cold night in Chicago. Smollett, who is gay and black, recounted that they shouted “This is MAGA country,” roughed him up, called him racial and homophobic slurs and put a noose around his neck.

But according to Chicago police, it was all a hoax. The actor practiced and staged the charade and paid two co-conspirators — Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo — to carry out the attack, authorities say, because he was dissatisfied with his salary on the show “Empire,” for which he has a starring role."

Actor Jussie Smollett’s character on “Empire,” Jamal Lyon, may disappear during this season’s final two episodes because of charges he faked his own racist, homophobic attack.

But it hasn’t stopped Fox from requesting security and traffic-control assistance from Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart’s office when it films scenes for an “Empire” episode Wednesday at Paw Paw Woods.

“It just seemed beyond the pale this request would come on the heels of Smollett being charged yesterday,” said a spokesman for Dart’s office.

“They wanted to know if we had officers available,” said the spokesman. “They claimed they may be doing some stunt driving, but did not mention Smollett,” according to the spokesman.

“And they also volunteered to pay the security costs from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day.”

Mice?

Mouse traps?

Too many varmints in the Governor’s Mansion complex?

Yep, Gov. J.B. Pritzker claims the crumbling ancillary building next to the Governor’s Mansion that houses the governor’s security detail is full of mousetraps … and he hopes to do something about it!

“There are mice and mouse traps everywhere [in the cops’ house],” Pritzker told the Sun-Times Editorial Board recently.

To the rescue?

The governor say first lady M.K. Pritzker may make rehabbing the cops’ new digs one of her first orders of business, since she was a member of the mighty megamillion-dollar privatized rehab effort headed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s wife, Diana.

Last November, Sneed asked if the new “old pile” would have “new style” when M.K. (an avid horse person) added her own personal touch.

It now looks like the busy mother of two won’t be adding a paddock, but a project to appropriately house the police.

“Nothing was done with that building,” said Pritzker.

“And the police do such a tremendous job,” he said.

“And they put up with a lot,” he added.

“So my wife is looking at how we could presently fundraise to help upgrade the state of that building.

“It’s unfair for people who work on the [Governor’s Mansion] property every day to be in these diminished conditions.”

Body language?

Please.

It’s about the knees.

Or is it?

For two nights in a row, Sneed watched Carol Marin and Phil Ponce question nearly a dozen candidates for Chicago’s mayor on WTTW-TV on issues ranging from taxes to whether they drank Malort, a malodorous brew growing in popularity.

But I wasn’t tracking their soundbites.

I was checking out their leg language.

Yep.

Seated atop barstools with back rests, I was transfixed by the way each candidate managed their leg room.

So I asked my trusty assistant, Francesca Gattuso, to check out explanations of leg language and came up with a few descriptions on the internet.

Paul Vallas was the only candidate who sat with his knees crossed.

• Translation? Comfort or closed and reserved attitude.

Bill Daley kept his knees open the widest … while tucking his feet firmly on each side of the stool’s leg rest.

Is it a signal of virility, dominance, strength and even a little bit of smugness?

Garry McCarthy’s open knees came in a close second.

The rest a close third.

Toni Preckwinkle was the only woman wearing a skirt and crossed her ankles. (Typical ladylike pose, but also a signal of self-restraint.)

Susana Mendoza and Amara Enyia wore slacks, but also crossed their ankles — which can also be similar to biting the lip, holding oneself from slipping another word, or hiding emotions of anger.

Lori Lightfoot positioned her feet on the stool’s leg rest like most of the men.

Confidence?

Dominance?

The bottom line?

Who will have the final leg up during Tuesday’s mayoral election.

But that’s what happened in the case of Jussie Smollett, a gay, black actor who stars in the show “Empire,” who claimed he was the victim of a vicious and brutal hate crime in Chicago. On Wednesday, Smollett was charged with filing a false police report and disorderly conduct.



Smollett initially blamed supporters of President Donald Trump for the attack, a narrative many in the mainstream media were eager to promote.



Before the story was even corroborated, Robin Roberts of “Good Morning America” had Smollett on for an interview.



But as facts rolled in, it became clear that Smollett’s story had a lot of holes. Now the Chicago Police Department is investigating him for hoaxing the whole incident.



Will those who jumped in to condemn Americans and the president for this incident be called on to apologize? Probably not.



Though many in the national media breathlessly covered Smollett’s initial version of events, at least some credit to local media is due. A CBS affiliate in Chicago did a fantastic job of covering this story from the beginning and remaining committed relaying the facts about the case. However, far too many rushed to promote this story as an indictment on the country.



This complete whiff by the media comes on the heels of the Covington Catholic fiasco. Remember when the media badly misconstrued a story involving a student wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and a Native American?



That disaster led to student’s parents suing The Washington Post for libel to the tune of $250 million.

What makes this particularly interesting is that Justice Clarence Thomas, just a day after the story about that libel suit broke, said in a concurring opinion that he questions the precedent set in the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan.



This case set the standard that “actual malice” or “reckless disregard” of the truth is the bar for libel. Changing that standard back to how American law was before this case could put media organizations in hot water for botching stories so badly.



One way or another, the Smollett and Covington stories, along with many others, have undermined American’s trust for the press, which often, collectively, seems eager to promote storylines that line up with their own political views rather staying committed to finding the truth.

The executive producers of Empire have confirmed that Jussie Smollett’s character will be written out of the final episodes of the show’s upcoming season.

The announcement comes a day after Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series, was arrested and released on USD 10,000 bond on suspicion of filing a false report about an incident on January 29 where the actor had claimed that he was attacked by two men screaming racial and homophobic slurs while leaving a restaurant in Chicago.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply,” read a statement from Empire executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season,” the statement further read.

A spokesperson would not comment on whether already-shot scenes will be cut, altered or reduced.

It was later reported that the actor may have been misleading the police, who believed that he may have paid two Nigerian brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to rehearse and stage the attack.

The brothers were arrested and later released without charge and are now believed to be assisting police in the investigation.

Officials also believe that Smollett is involved in crafting a threatening ransom note-style letter that was sent to the Empire production offices a week before the alleged attack.

The crime carries a felony charge, and if Smollett is found guilty he could face up to three years in prison and up to USD 25,000 in fine.

The actor had earlier denied the Chicago Police claims that he paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him.

Empire is currently in its fifth season.

Some people inflate their performance record. Some people invent a fake job offer from a competitor. Then, allegedly, there’s the “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.

Smollett has been at the center of a firestorm since he was allegedly attacked in Chicago last month by two men shouting homophobic and racist insults. Last week, Chicago police charged Smollett with a felony for filing a false police report, and say he paid two men to fake the attack in order to help him in salary negotiations. He was suspended from his TV program, “Empire,” on Friday. Smollett denies the charges. He is reportedly paid about $125,000 per episode.

“ ‘My advice: Don’t lie in a salary negotiation, period. But if you do decide to lie, you certainly don’t cook up a story that harms innocent people.’ ” — —Denise Dudley, a behavioral psychologist and the founder of training company SkillPath Seminars

“My advice: Don’t lie in a salary negotiation, period,” said Denise Dudley, a behavioral psychologist and the founder of training company SkillPath Seminars. “But if you do decide to lie, you certainly don’t cook up a story that harms innocent people, muddies up the waters on all sorts of important human rights fronts, ties up police, FBI, and the judicial system, and lands you with a felony charge.”

Smollett’s lawyers have vigorously defended the actor, who has repeatedly said that the attack was not fake. However, the Chicago police have released a lengthy report, alleging the actor knew the two suspects and engaged in phone calls with them prior to the reported attack. The police say it was an elaborate publicity stunt to boost his profile. “You definitely don’t want to have a couple of people beat you up with ‘MAGA’ hats on,” adds adviser Monica Dwyer of Harvest Financial.

Smollett’s example is over-the-top by most people’s standards, but even less extreme falsehoods during salary negotiations can be a mistake, Dudley said. It’s never good to call anyone’s bluff if you believe you’re worth more than your pay packet. “Personally, I’m not a fan of lying on any level — fake mugging story or fake Google job offer,” she told MarketWatch. “If you’re found out down the road, it’s grounds for termination in every organization I’ve ever worked with.”

“ ‘They should go in seeking to prove their value, and they should have an alternative. The better your alternative, the more you have power.’ ” — —Carolyn Goerner, who teaches negotiation at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business

Carolyn Goerner, who teaches negotiation at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, says those seeking a raise should focus instead on two keys to success: Evidence that they’re worth the extra money, and a backup plan.

“They should go in seeking to prove their value, and they should have an alternative,” says Goerner. Your employer doesn’t care why you want more money, she notes. They just care why they should pay it. And you are in a much stronger position if you have a good alternative, she adds. In management circles, she says, the backup is known as a BATNA: Your Best Alternative To the Negotiated Agreement. “The better your alternative, the more you have power,” says Goerner.

Meanwhile, Dwyer says you shouldn’t neglect working the office politics, and learn how to negotiate aggressively. “And always ask for more than what you want,” she says. In the 1990s, the cast of “Friends” famously banded together to negotiate $1 million per episode, a record deal for television actors in the 1990s. But that was a cast of six stars rather than a much larger ensemble cast. Smollett has been cut from the two final episodes of “Empire,” which airs on Fox FOX, +0.76% ."

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has spoken out against Jussie Smollett after the “Empire” actor was charged by police for allegedly filing a false police report.

“Like most of you, I’ve seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I’m sad, frustrated, and disappointed,” Harris said in a statement posted Thursday on Twitter. “When anyone makes false claims to police, it not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but it makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward.”

The presidential candidate also highlighted the rise in hate crimes in recent years, which she said was muddled by the recent Smollett scandal.

“Part of the tragedy of this situation is that it distracts from the truth, and has been seized by some who would like to dismiss and downplay the very real problems that we must address,” she wrote. “We should not allow that.”

“I will always condemn racism and homophobia,” she continued. “We must always confront hate directly, and we must always seek justice. That is what I will keep fighting for.”

Chicago police charged Smollett on Wednesday with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report after he told police on Jan. 29 that he had been attacked by two men who poured bleach on him and put a rope around his neck after using racial and homophobic slurs. Investigators now believe Smollett paid acquaintances Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo to help him stage the attack.

Soon after, Smollett surrendered to authorities and was arrested early Thursday morning in Chicago. He could face one to three years in prison, if convicted of the felony charge.

Previously, Harris tweeted her support of Smollett, calling the attack a “modern day lynching.”

“No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,” she wrote. “We must confront this hate.”

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching.

Jussie Smollett, after his attack on 29th January 2019, sat with ABC News’ Robin Roberts for his first interview. In that interview, published on the 15th of February 2019, Jussie detailed the night of his attack. He said the attack happened at about 2am as he was leaving a Subway Restaurant in Chicago.

According to him, the two attackers got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, and they put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him.

When asked why he hesitated to call the police. He responded by saying, “there’s a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man you’re considered to be somehow weak. And I’m not weak; we [the gay community] are not weak. I’m glad that Frank reported it.” This was at the center of all he said throughout the interview: his pride, how society considers gay people and his empowerment of gay men. What he didn’t, however, add was that any of it be done by violence.

ABC News’ Robin Roberts asked him what he would say to a young gay man and this was his answer: “learn to fight; learn to be a fighter. I’m not advocating violence…”

The two attackers, in a new twist to the case, have alleged that Jussie Smollett paid them to orchestrate and stage the attack on him. According to them, Smollett was upset that the threatening letter sent to Empire studios didn’t receive enough attention. Jussie’s attorney in response to this new twist said: ‘Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he’s familiar with. He [Jussie Smollett] has now been victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’ The threatening letter is now gaining serious attention as journalists are asking whether he sent them himself.

Today on ABC News, the police released a formal statement calling Jussie Smollett’s attack fake. He’s been charged a felony, for filing a fake report.

There was no question the news coverage was going to be massive.

In many ways, that coverage is an object lesson in the foibles of modern reporting. The story showed where news outlets teeter on the line between driving social media and being driven by it, between healthy skepticism and cautious credulity.

“We have the combination of social media and a polarized country converging here,” said Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Everyone is seeing events “from their political lens. No one is really good at distancing themselves.”

The story began as an account of a hate crime that went viral instantly.

A star of the hit Fox television show “Empire,” Smollett reported that he had been attacked around 2 a.m. on January 29 on his way home from a sandwich shop. Smollett — who is black, gay, and Jewish — said two masked men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured bleach on him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck.

He also claimed they shouted, “This is MAGA country” — a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

National media soon got wind of the story. Social media poured rocket fuel on it and set it ablaze.

Celebrities including “Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox and Oscar winner Viola Davis tweeted their love and support. Talk show host Andy Cohen, who is also gay, tweeted simply: “This. Is. Vile.”

Within hours, now Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — both African-American — compared the attack to an “attempted modern-day lynching.” Even President Donald Trump seemed to take the story at face value.

But as police searched for surveillance footage of the attack, people began to wonder. Two men seen in a video went from being persons of interest to suspects, then to witnesses against Smollett.

It all came crashing down Thursday, when the 36-year-old actor turned himself in and was charged with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that alleges he made a false police report. Police claim Smollett staged the attack, enlisting two brothers who were his friends because he was unhappy with his salary.

After Smollett was charged, it seemed people who had been holding back suddenly felt free to admit they had doubts all along.

CNN anchor Don Lemon — who met Smollett during a guest appearance on “Empire” — said his initial reaction to the attack was not disbelief but “sadness.”

“I wasn’t shocked,” Lemon, a black man who came out as gay in 2011, told “Entertainment Tonight.” “I didn’t like that it happened to him.”

As police waited for Smollett to surrender, Lemon acknowledged Wednesday on CNN that many in the gay and African-American communities “had questions about this from the very beginning, the veracity of this story.”

It was minus 4 degrees that night.

“And let’s be honest,” Lemon said, “there are probably not a whole lot of MAGA fans watching ‘Empire.'”

But Smollett stuck to his story. And until a couple of weeks in, the media had nothing but a “gut” feeling to go on, said Tom Jones, senior media writer for the Florida-based Poynter Institute.

“I think most of the media handled it responsibly, saying, ‘Hey look. Here’s what the allegations are. Here’s what he’s saying. Here’s what he claimed happened. And then we’ll see where the investigation goes from here,'” Jones said.

“The word ‘alleged’ was all over any reference from the moment it was first reported,” Northwestern’s Whitaker added. “I didn’t hear a lot of really super-sympathetic coverage.”

Conservative columnist Ben Shapiro disagrees. He told Fox News that the volume of coverage on Smollett was “enormous” because “there’s a narrative to be promoted.”

“When a story is too perfect to be true, it usually is, and this is one of those cases,” he said.

Joe Saltzman said the Smollett story was a case of sheer “overkill,” even in this era of the 24-hour news cycle.

“This is not good journalism,” Saltzman, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, wrote in an email. “This is gossip and chatter.”

Robin Roberts, anchor of ABC’s “Good Morning America,” came in for some of the harshest criticism for a February 14 exclusive interview with Smollett. Many accused her of failing to push him hard enough.

On Thursday’s show, Roberts called the situation a “setback for race relations,” adding that she “cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.”

Trump’s sympathy for Smollett also evaporated. “What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?” he tweeted Thursday, tagging the actor.

Earlier this week, as Smollett’s story began to unravel, his siblings took to Instagram.

“This is the media, an irresponsible media,” Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett posted, using a picture and slightly altered quotation from slain civil rights leader Malcolm X. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”

Smollett is free after posting $10,000 in bail, and his attorneys said he maintains his innocence.

On Friday, he was cut from the final two episodes of this season of “Empire.”

During a news conference announcing the charges, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson surveyed the packed room of reporters.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said angrily.

Roger Stone and his supporters have been completely silenced. The Deep State Media will continue to report on his case and continue to ""taint the jury."" On February 21, federal judge Amy Berman Jackson completely restricted Roger Stone's ability to speak publicly about his case. Stone had published an Instagram post with what appeared to be the crosshairs drawn behind her head. Stone claims that it was a Celtic cross. Whether it was crosshairs, a Celtic cross, or a Gnostic cross, Stone should have known that the judge would be looking for any excuse to silence him completely. What is extremely troubling about her gag order is that she is attempting to gag ""spokespersons, family members or even 'many volunteers'.""

I am a volunteer making statements on behalf of Roger Stone. Judge Amy Berman Jackson may believe that her black robe makes her some kind of high priestess. I do not write under a pseudonym, and I am available if Judge Berman Jackson would like to speak to me. I may be mistaken, but I believe that citizens of the United States still have the right to speak their minds. If Stone is foolish enough to violate this gag order, he may be looking forward to several months in solitary confinement. Judge Amy Berman Jackson had Paul Manafort arrested, and he spent 23 hours a day in solitary. While Stone and his supporters are gagged, the Deep State media will be free to distort everything surrounding the case. News reports routinely refer to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign staff. Thirty-year National Security Agency veteran William Binney claims that reports of Russia election meddling are nothing more than propaganda. John McAfee, a pioneer in computer security and founder of the McAfee anti-virus company, also claims that these reports of Russian hacking are inaccurate. Yet the Deep State media continue to report this as a fact. Talking heads like Jake Tapper can suggest that Stone will enjoy his imprisonment: ""He might like it."" Will Tapper make a similar joke about Jussie Smollet's possible imprisonment? Media coverage can do more than just taint a jury. Stone has been unable to go out in public without being harassed or having his life threatened. The students at Covington Catholic High School received death threats and were threatened with expulsion because of biased media reporting. In addition to the Deep State media, the government has been doing its best to taint a jury. The arrest of Roger Stone was engineered to provide maximum media attention. Stone's lawyer has information that suggests that Robert Mueller's lead investigator, Andrew Weissmann, sent CNN a heads-up in advance of the raid. Stone's attorneys have asked both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to investigate how someone could have obtained a sealed grand jury indictment. CNN continues to deny that it was informed about the raid. Anderson Cooper, sounding more convincing than Jussie Smollett, claimed that Congressman Collins's suggestion that CNN had prior notice ""should be beyond ridiculous."" Cooper asserted, ""Truth is, we got the scoop through good old shoe-leather reporting and a little luck. No tip-off — just hard work."" Somehow, CNN knew there would be this ridiculously excessive show of force rather that a request for Stone to present himself at a courthouse at a reasonable time of day. The CNN crew was also allowed on a street that had been blocked off. The arrest of Roger Stone was not an insignificant operation. It certainly cost the taxpayers several hundred thousand dollars and took place during a government shutdown. If the head of the FBI did not know about it, he is either not in charge of the FBI or so incompetent that he has no business in that position. If FBI director Christopher Wray approved of this raid, it would indicate that the Deep State is still in complete control of the FBI.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s elected auditor says officials in 18 of the state’s 67 counties reported accepting gifts, meals or trips from firms competing to sell voting machines ahead of the 2020 elections. Democratic Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said Friday that accepting the gifts is wrong, even though it’s a legal practice and officials may have taken no action in return. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is pressing counties to buy new voting machines with voter-auditable paper backups.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s prison system says it’s close to settling two federal lawsuits over how it processes mail sent to inmates by lawyers. The Department of Corrections and civil rights groups said Friday they were finalizing a settlement after trial was stopped while the parties negotiated. At issue is a policy designed to combat drug smuggling in prisons.

It was enacted in September after an increase in prison employees seeking medical care for suspected exposure to synthetic marijuana. A prisoner and four civil rights groups sued to challenge the policy, which directs prison workers to open legal mail in the inmates’ presence, give them copies and keep the originals for 45 days. Prison officials say that by early April they expect to again provide prisoners with original legal mail documents.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania health care giant UPMC is going on the legal offensive against the state attorney general’s office in a battle over insurance coverage rules. UPMC filed a federal lawsuit against Attorney General Josh Shapiro this week and responded in state court to a lawsuit against UPMC that Shapiro’s office began earlier this month.

UPMC says Shapiro is unlawfully interfering in federal programs and claims he has illegally taken over nonprofit health care in the state. Shapiro’s lawsuit seeks to keep UPMC from ending its business relationship with rival Highmark Health. UPMC’s federal lawsuit aims to clarify its rights and obligations under federal law. A spokesman for Shapiro says UPMC’s new filings indicate it will devote resources to a legal battle instead of focusing on its nonprofit charity mission.

CHICAGO (AP) — Lawyers for Jussie Smollett say the Chicago Police Department put on an “organized law enforcement spectacle” when its superintendent detailed investigators’ findings about the alleged attack on the “Empire” actor. In a statement, Smollett’s legal team said Superintendent Eddie Johnson’s comments had no place in the American legal system.

Johnson said Smollett owes the city an apology and should admit what he did. Smollett is accused of paying two men to help stage the Jan. 29 attack. Smollett’s lawyers say the presumption of innocence was trampled upon at the expense of Smollett. The statement called Smollett a man of “impeccable character and integrity” who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.

FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — Police in Massachusetts have charged teenage girls ages 14 and 15 with robbing a bank. Fall River police say the 14-year-old girl walked into a BayCoast Bank branch in the city on Wednesday afternoon and told a teller she would “blow everything up and kill everybody” if the teller did not hand over cash.

A bank employee handed the girl an “undetermined” amount of money and she left. The girl was seen on surveillance video getting into a black Toyota Camry outside the bank allegedly driven by the older girl.

Police got a look at the license plate and traced the car to a home in the city where they found the girls.

Both are charged with armed robbery. Their names were not released because of their ages.

ROSWELL, N.M. (AP) — A New Mexico woman is on a desperate hunt for her disappearing pet that can’t run fast and can’t be missed — a 100-pound tortoise. KOB-TV reports Dusty the Turtle went missing earlier this month in Roswell, New Mexico after strong winds knocked open a gate that housed him.

Shana Emmert, who was pet sitting Dusty for her niece, says she believes the turtle strolled away from the backyard and into the desert during the wind storm. According to Emmert’s neighbors, the 100-pound (45-kilogram) Dusty was last spotted near Berrendo Creek in Roswell and hasn’t been seen since. The family is offering a $500 reward for the turtle’s safe return.

Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign stop in Concord, N.H., February 18, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)

Why Kamala Harris may be her own worst enemy

No Democrat running for president has had a better 2019 than Kamala Harris. The numbers tell the tale. The California senator was in the low single digits in polls conducted before her official launch on January 28. She is now in the low double digits, running third behind Joe Biden, who enjoys cosmic name recognition, and Bernie Sanders, whose devoted supporters brought him a second-place finish last time. But polls do not tell the whole story.

Harris raised $1.5 million in the day after declaring her candidacy. That number, impressive for a senator not even a third of the way through her first term, has been bested only by Sanders, a socialist who has a venture capitalist’s talent for raising money. He brought in $5.9 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign. Harris, however, has something Sanders does not.

She is a fresh face of middle age (54 years) and of diverse background (her father is Jamaican, her mother Indian) whose chief rivals at the moment are two geriatric white men. As Democrats search for someone new to lead them against President Trump, Harris has distinguished herself from the field. Her CNN town hall drew record ratings, while Amy Klobuchar’s flopped. And Harris leads the 2020 Democrats in social-media interactions, according to an Axios/Newswhip study. She’s had a good launch. But there’s a caveat.

David Axelrod has described presidential campaigns as MRIs for the soul. He means that a candidate is subjected to pressures strong enough to reveal his or her true character. What voters get at the end of the process is a fuller picture of the men and women they choose to inhabit the White House. In these early weeks of what is certain to be a seemingly endless and certainly vitriolic campaign, Harris has demonstrated both strengths and weaknesses. Her strength is that she seems a perfect fit for the current shape of the Democratic party. Her weakness is a blithe and insouciant manner that is sure to cause her trouble. In fact it already has. Consider three recent slipups.

The first took place during that CNN special. An audience member asked Senator Harris for her “solution to ensure that people have access to quality health care at an affordable price,” and “does that solution involve cutting insurance companies as we know them out of the equation?” You bet it does, was Harris’s answer. “We need to have Medicare-for-all. That’s just the bottom line.” Following up, Jake Tapper mentioned that Harris has co-sponsored a bill that would end employer-based insurance, which covers some 180 million Americans. “So,” Tapper asked, “for people out there who like their insurance, they don’t get to keep it?”

Harris seemed not to understand the magnitude of the change she supports. She mentioned the “process of going through an insurance company,” how “going through all of that paperwork” has caused delays and headaches for many. “Let’s eliminate all of that,” she said. “Let’s move on.”

Actually, let’s stay still for now, and ask the following questions. Harris promises to end the health coverage of millions without providing a satisfactory rationale for, or explanation of, her position. Does she really believe there won’t be paperwork in government-run health care? Paperwork is government’s specialty. And if the Obamacare mandate was unpopular, how will voters greet President Harris’s mandate to “eliminate” the status quo that covers the vast majority? The substance of her answer was obvious catnip for Republicans always eager to “pounce,” and the style was no less harmful. Harris did not give the impression that she took either the question or the implications of her answer all too seriously. This is something that happens often.

Moment two: On January 29, after Jussie Smollett claimed he had been attacked in a hate crime by two white Trump fans in the middle of a wintry Chicago night, Harris tweeted her support for the actor. “This was an attempted modern day lynching,” she said. “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.” What Harris did not mention were the curious details of the story — details that the Chicago Police Department investigated and finally debunked. It turns out Smollett was attacked not by white supremacists but by two Nigerian immigrants whom he had put up to the job. The “modern day lynching” was a bogus, disgusting, and exploitative affront to the real victims of hatred. A prepared candidate would have expressed regret at her tweet and familiarity with the case. Harris was not prepared.

During a visit to New Hampshire last weekend, a reporter asked Harris if she would like to revisit her words about Smollett. Harris clearly had no idea what the reporter was talking about. “Which tweet? What tweet?” she said. The reporter read the tweet back to Harris. Who stood there, agog, looking to her aides for help. And who finally answered, “I think that the facts are still unfolding, and, um, I’m very, um concerned about obviously, the initial, um, allegation that he made about what might have happened.” Except it didn’t happen. Nor is it clear if Harris actually wrote the tweet in support of Smollett. She might hold positions, including on health care, the details of which she is unaware. Which is a problem.

Anecdote three is a family matter. On February 11, Harris appeared on the Breakfast Club podcast. One of the hosts wanted to know if she was against legalizing marijuana. “That’s not true,” she said. “Look, I joke about it, I have joked about it. Half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?” She’s smoked weed herself. “I have. And I inhaled. I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes. I just broke news.” She went on to explain that she smoked a joint, not a blunt. And that marijuana “gives people joy.” Her father felt no joy, however, at Harris’s answer.

In a statement released to the website Jamaica Global Online, Donald Harris, an economist, wrote: “My dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to their family’s name, reputation, and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this controversy.” Father’s Day should be interesting.

What trips up Kamala Harris is an evident desire to please her audience. She wants no enemies to her left, no identity politics left untouched. She can’t run as a prosecutor — crime fighting is so 1990s — but she can run as brash, bold, and woke. Her verbal miscues are possible evidence that this latest political fashion doesn’t quite fit. She has made a habit of making unforced errors, and the game is only in its first month. Harris’s Democratic opponents may be too blinkered or bashful to exploit this weakness. That will not be a problem for her Republican opponent.

Kelly with abusing 4 victims

CHICAGO — R. Kelly, the R&B star who has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves, was charged Friday with aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17.

ADVERTISING

In a brief appearance before reporters, Cook County State’s Attorney’s Kim Foxx announced the 10 counts against the 52-year-old Grammy winner. She said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade. She did not comment on the charges or take questions.

The singer, who has consistently denied any sexual misconduct, was to appear in court Saturday. A message seeking comment from Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, was not immediately returned.

His arrest sets the stage for another #MeToo-era celebrity trial. Bill Cosby went to prison last year, and former Hollywood studio boss Harvey Weinstein is awaiting trial.

Best known for hits such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” Kelly was charged a week after Michael Avenatti, the attorney whose clients have included porn star Stormy Daniels, said he recently gave Chicago prosecutors new video evidence of the singer with an underage girl. It was not immediately clear if the charges were connected to that video, which Avenatti said includes audio in which Kelly and the girl say several times that she is 14 years old.

Trump vows veto as Democrats try to block emergency order

WASHINGTON — Democrats controlling the House have teed up a vote next week to block President Donald Trump from using a national emergency declaration to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, accelerating a showdown in Congress that could divide Republicans and lead to Trump’s first veto.

The Democrats introduced a resolution Friday to block Trump’s declaration, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House would vote on the measure Tuesday. It is sure to pass, and the GOP-run Senate may adopt it as well. Trump quickly promised a veto.

“Will I veto it? 100 percent,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

Any Trump veto would likely be sustained, but the upcoming battle will test Republican support for the president’s move, which even some of his allies view as a stretch — and a slap at lawmakers’ control over the power of the federal purse.

Venezuela opposition leader Guaido appears at aid concert

CUCUTA, Colombia — Defying orders banning him from leaving the country, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan made a surprise appearance at a star-studded aid concert in neighboring Colombia, joining thousands of other Venezuelans in pressuring President Nicolas Maduro into allowing the delivery of emergency food and medicine.

On the Venezuelan side, a much smaller crowd gathered for a rival, three-day “Hands Off Venezuela” festival being organized by Maduro. Even as several million Venezuelans flee the country and those who remain struggle to find basic goods like food and antibiotics, the embattled president claims the relief effort led by Guaido is a U.S. orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.

The optimistic mood at the Live Aid-style concert opened in the Colombian border city of Cucuta couldn’t mask underlying tensions a day before Maduro’s opponents embark on a risky strategy to undermine Maduro and bring in the aid being amassed along three of Venezuela’s borders. But the crowd reacted with joy when Guaido suddenly appeared.

He was greeted with shouts of: “Juan arrived! Juan arrived!”

From wire sources

Thousands of kilometers away, near a crossing with Brazil, a member of an indigenous tribe was killed and 22 more injured in clashes with security forces who enforced Maduro’s orders to keep out the aid.

Criminal charges possible in North Carolina’s US House fight

RALEIGH, N.C. — With a new election ordered in North Carolina’s disputed congressional race, a key question remains unanswered: Who could face criminal charges after a state elections board hearing exposed evidence of ballot fraud?

Among those in potential legal trouble are the central figure in the scandal, political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, and some of those working for him. According to testimony heard by the board, they illegally gathered up voters’ absentee ballots and, in some cases, filled in votes and forged signatures.

The Republican candidate for whom Dowless was working, Mark Harris, has denied knowledge of any illegal practices by those working for his campaign. But he, too, could come under legal scrutiny.

Harris led Democrat Dan McCready by just 905 votes out of about 280,000 cast last fall in the district along the southern edge of the state. But the state refused to certify the outcome because of suspicions Dowless tampered with mail-in absentee ballots in rural Bladen County. Under state law, only voters and their close relatives can handle completed ballots, a measure intended to guard against tampering.

On Thursday, the five-member elections board unanimously ordered a do-over election after Harris abruptly reversed course and called for a new one. No date has been set.

Trump sets up abortion obstacles, barring clinic referrals

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday set up new obstacles for women seeking abortions, barring taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals. The new policy is certain to be challenged in court.

The final rule released Friday by the Health and Human Services Department also would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from being housed in the same locations as abortion providers, and require stricter financial separation. Clinic staff would still be permitted to discuss abortion with clients.

The move was decried by women’s groups and praised by religious conservatives, but it could be some time before women served by the federal family program feel the full impact.

Women’s groups, organizations representing the clinics, and Democratic-led states are expected to sue to block the policy from going into effect. Administration officials told abortion opponents on a call Friday that they expect legal action, according to a participant.

Abortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal laws prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman.

Social media provides fuel for Jussie Smollett story

CHICAGO — The story Jussie Smollett told police had it all: racism, homophobia, politics, celebrity — all tied up with a hangman’s noose. There was no question the news coverage was going to be massive.

In many ways, that coverage is an object lesson in the foibles of modern reporting. The story showed where news outlets teeter on the line between driving social media and being driven by it, between healthy skepticism and cautious credulity.

“We have the combination of social media and a polarized country converging here,” said Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Everyone is seeing events “from their political lens. No one is really good at distancing themselves.”

The story began as an account of a hate crime that went viral instantly.

A star of the hit Fox television show “Empire,” Smollett reported that he had been attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 on his way home from a sandwich shop. Smollett — who, like his character, is black and gay — said two masked men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured bleach on him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck.

Virginia Republicans invite Fairfax’s accusers to testify

RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia House Republicans announced plans Friday to hold a public hearing where Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and the two women who have recently accused him of sexual assault can testify, a move that will likely inflame a partisan battle over the General Assembly’s role in investigating the allegations.

Republican Del. Rob Bell said the House Courts of Justice Committee will invite Vanessa Tyson, Meredith Watson and Fairfax to a hearing at an unspecified future date.

“This will give all parties a chance to be heard,” Bell said in brief remarks on the House floor.

He added that Republicans believe they have a duty to investigate the allegations made against the lieutenant governor.

Democratic House members have said they don’t believe the General Assembly is the best place to investigate the allegations at this time and said they don’t want to impede possible criminal investigations.

A bumpy road to the Oscars could end in triumph for Netflix

LOS ANGELES — The most tumultuous Oscar season in memory might pale in comparison to the aftermath.

The best picture race to Sunday’s 91st Academy Awards remains unpredictable, but odds makers peg Alfonso Cuaron’s “Roma” as the film most likely to triumph at the end of the night. That would hand Netflix, the insurgent streaming service, the most prestigious honor in a movie business it has thoroughly disrupted.

Change is everywhere at this year’s Academy Awards, from the nominees to the show, itself. For the second time in 30 years, there will be no host at Sunday’s show, which begins airing live on ABC at 8 p.m. EST. The lead-up to the Oscars has been dominated by dispute over the academy’s own attempts at innovation to counter last year’s record-low ratings. But after uproar from academy members, those plans — not showing some awards live, introducing a “best popular film” category — were abandoned.

ADVERTISING

Even if the Oscars end up proceeding more conventionally, the winners promise to be untraditional. Marvel stands to win its first Oscar for either “Black Panther” (up for six Oscars including best picture) or the animated favorite, “Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse.” Spike Lee, aiming for his first competitive Oscar, could become the first black filmmaker to win best director.

“Roma,” which comes in with a co-leading 10 nominations, is favored to win best picture, best director, best cinematography and best foreign language film. If “Roma” won best picture, it would be the first foreign language movie ever to do so."

This is due to his recent involvement in a false report case. The actor was arrested and charged with the offense of staging his own attack, felony and disorderly conduct.

The producers were forced to make the announcement after the arrest as he was only set free after posting bond.

The statement which was undersigned by producers: Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer, reads thus.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of the Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays. We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of `Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season’.”

The Empire series is on its mid-season break but it is set to return to tv screens on 13th of March. Since the last two episodes are still in the production stage, Jussie will not feature in them.

Kaley Cuoco is causing all sorts of havoc behind-the-scenes on The Big Bang Theory, and rightly so.

The NBC sitcom comes to an end in a mere seven episodes time, but that hasn’t stopped Kaley, 33 – who stars as Penny – being a LOL-a-minute by continuing to disrupt filming for her co-stars.

‘Slowly but surely being a terrible influence on my co stars by teaching them to find the lens instead of listening to our writer who’s trying to give us notes on this scene,’ she wrote alongside a the shot.

The Star Trek hero came on board alongside a slew of famous faces, including Joe Manganiello, Kevin Smith and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. So yes, we truly are bowing out with a bang with one of the best celebrity appearances from the past 12 seasons.

Speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, producer Eric Kaplan revealed how they managed to bag Captain Kirk himself after all this time.

‘Clearly he [William Shatner] should be on The Big Bang Theory,’ said Kaplan.

‘The characters are big fans of Star Trek the original series and finally we had an episode that we thought was right for him, and he thought was right for him, so he was happy to do it and we were happy to have him.

‘It just seemed like a good idea to everyone, including him.’

The Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays on CBS in the US and E4 in the UK.

Jussie Smollett, the openly gay star of the television show “Empire,” told Chicago police that two men assaulted him outside his apartment last month. The 36-year-old actor claimed the men beat him, poured a chemical on him, and wrapped a noose around his neck. The attackers, Smollett would later say, were screaming, “This is MAGA country!”

Why did he think he was targeted? Racist homophobia whipped up by President Trump.

The left largely agreed, and Smollett was made an overnight martyr by celebrities, many in the media, and politicians who held up his attack as a microcosm of everything wrong with Trump’s America. Then the story unraveled, according to police.

The two men were not conservative goons. They were actors who admitted Smollett paid them to stage the attack. The bruises and scratches were not real injuries. They look to police to be self-inflicted. The attack was not a hate crime. The incident appears to be an attempt to bolster his career and, possibly, boost his salary.

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Thursday after Smollett was charged with a felony for falsifying a police report. “To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks. Celebrities, news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor.”

And with that statement a municipal police chief raised a question that resonated far beyond Chicago: How should a politician with national ambitions react to still-unfolding stories? Should they weigh in at all? At least three Democrats need an answer.

Sen. Kristin Gillibrand was the first to tweet when news broke of the attack. “This is a sickening and outrageous attack, and horribly, it's the latest of too many hate crimes against LGBTQ people and people of color. We are all responsible for condemning this behavior and every person who enables or normalizes it. Praying for Jussie and his family,” the New York senator wrote.

Sen. Cory Booker followed up a couple hours later. “The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I'm glad he's safe,” the New Jersey lawmaker wrote before plugging hate crime legislation pending in the Senate.

Not to be outdone, California Sen. Kamala Harris, spoke out shortly after Booker. “This was an attempted modern day lynching,” she tweeted. “No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

None of those candidates responded to requests for comment from RealClearPolitics. Each has since amended his or her statement. Only Harris, however, has condemned Smollett by name for diverting “resources away from serious investigations” and making it “more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward.”

This has become a liability for each of the Democrats who were too eager to signal their support for Smollett to wait for all the facts to emerge. And the White House has not only defended the president from charges that he inspired racist violence, the administration is now making a martyr of Trump, condemning anyone who implies he motivated the alleged violence.

Like his challengers, Trump condemned the alleged attack, at first calling it “horrible.” When more details emerged, the president later demanded on Twitter that Smollett answer for smearing “the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee saw the episode as part of a broader problem. “It is another sad example,” she told Fox News, “of people so quick to want to attack and come after this president.”

While it made news headlines across the country, the story has already started to recede. Smollett has been removed from the final two episodes of “Empire.” The Russia investigation has returned to the chyrons of cable news. The Iowa caucuses remain nearly a year away – plenty of time for countless other controversies and scandals to emerge.

The episode should not be forgotten though. Strategists and operatives say the 2020 presidential field needs to learn their lesson now. The story was so egregious and the details so horrifying, David Axelrod tells RCP, that he understands why it engendered such a quick response: “People with a public platform felt the need to speak out.”

“Presidential candidates particularly are compelled to exercise moral leadership when stories like this arise,” added Barack Obama’s former top strategist. “But this is also a useful parable about exercising caution about reacting in the moment before all the facts are known.”

The initial story proved too tempting for candidates to adopt that wait-and-see approach. Being the first to condemn bigotry brings significant political capital in a primary field where candidates increasingly compete with each other for the title of most “woke.”

Writing in the Atlantic, John McWhorter speculated why Smollett would want to become a “professional martyr.”

“The reason might be that he has come of age in an era when nothing he could have done or said would have made him look more interesting than being attacked on the basis of his color and sexual orientation,” wrote the Columbia University professor.

The first candidate to empathize with that suffering, real or otherwise, may seem more interesting by extension. Smollett checked each of the intersectional boxes of voters politicians are currently courting. He is black. He is openly gay. He claimed he was attacked because of his skin color, his sexuality, and his politics.

Being first carries some risks, however, as veteran Democratic political strategist Dane Strother points out. Get it wrong, he says, and a candidate runs the risk of earning a reputation for being “half-cocked full time.”

It is not a question of “if” but “when,” Strother added. In another seven days something else will happen -- “maybe a kid falls down a well” -- and candidates will face a similar temptation. The strategist advises his candidates to think before they tweet, to “understand all the facts before you make the statement,” and to recognize that “being first isn’t necessarily going to get you kudos.”

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic consultant based in South Carolina, agreed that candidates should learn “the specifics” in order to make a “proper response.” But he doesn’t knock Booker, Harris, or Gillibrand, “for whatever positions they have taken.”

The African-American strategist worries instead that the Smollett story, and the ensuing political controversy, will discourage candidates from speaking out in the future. “We cannot ignore the fact that hate crimes do exist,” he said."

Big media have had plenty to be outraged over during the tough times they have been living through in the age of Trump the Terrible. When the New York Times writes its version of the history of Western civilization, today will be at the epicenter of what the paper will describe as the dark ages. The media are outraged over the silly, like how President Trump gets two scoops of ice cream or doesn't have a pet dog in the White House. They are also incensed over what they believe is serious, that Trump colluded with Putin to steal the election from Hillary Clinton, despite there being not one iota of evidence supporting their belief. It's much like believing that Elvis and Bigfoot are regularly splashing around with the Loch Ness Monster.

There is plenty the media could be outraged about but are not. Where is the outrage over the Obama administration spying on its political opponent's presidential campaign, then, when caught, using unverified opposition research to obtain a FISA warrant to cover its misdeeds? Followed by finagling a special counsel appointment to put the blanket of investigational secrecy over its illegal and treasonous activities? No outrage. The media swallowed the Jussie Smollett hoax hook, line, and sinker, without scrutiny, investigation, or hesitation. When it turned out to be not only a hoax, but also a preplanned and rehearsed drama, much like Smollett's former TV show Empire, the media felt let down, but not outraged. Now that Smollett has been arrested for his hoax, the media will slither away from this story as fast as they can. What little indignation they have is directed toward ""[t]he celebrity press and among activists and among Twitter people"", as explained by CNN's own activist and Twitter person, Brian Stelter. Oh no, it wasn't us real journalists here at CNN and other major media outlets peddling the false Jussie Smollett story endlessly, and of course blaming President Trump; it was everyone else. Nice try, but that won't sell, since there is plenty of evidence, as Twitchy chronicled, of big media rushing to judgment. There are plenty more examples of media outrage over false stories that the media dutifully presented only one side of as part of their agenda journalism. These include the Duke lacrosse team; the University of Virginia rape case; ""hands up, don't shoot""; and the Justice Kavanaugh accusations — all discredited, but reported as undisputed gospel truth by the lazy and corrupt media. There is no outrage over biased and malicious reporting, just the fake humility of acknowledging they were duped, again, then quickly moving on to the next outrage. This is exactly why Rush Limbaugh calls them the ""drive-by media"": they drive by a story, sputter fire and brimstone for a week or two, then quickly drive on after the story is debunked. This week's outrage is from CNN itself over the fact that the network hired someone who worked in the Trump administration. Here is the apparent problem. CNN says it is hiring Sarah Isgur Flores, who most recently served in the Justice Department as Jeff Sessions' spokesman, to be a political editor in the Washington bureau. Flores is a longtime Republican political operative who previously worked for Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz and Mitt Romney. CNN employees, led by one of their gadflies, Brian Stelter, are fit to be tied, ""[q]uestioning whether her sudden leap from the Trump administration to the CNN newsroom is an ethical breach."" Oh, the outrage of a ""revolving door"" between administrations and newsrooms. And the family relationships between Democrat administrations and journalists. How about these ""ethical breaches""? CNN's senior vice president of newsgathering, Virginia Moseley, is married to Thomas R. Nides, who was a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration. ABC News reporter Matthew Jaffe is married to former Obama deputy press secretary Katie Hogan. Obama's national security adviser, Susan ""Benghazi was caused by a YouTube video"" Rice, is married to former ABC News executive producer Ian Cameron. David Rhodes was president of CBS News during the Obama administration, at the same time his brother Ben served as a deputy national security advisor to President Obama. During those same years, Ben Sherwood was president of ABC News while his wife Karen was deputy secretary of energy in the Obama regime. Claire Shipman is the senior national correspondent for ABC's Good Morning America. She is married to Jay Carney, Obama's former White House press secretary. Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, neck deep in spy-gate, is an official CNN correspondent whom CNN host Chris Cuomo welcomed to the ""family."" Laura Jarrett, daughter of Obama consigliere Valerie Jarrett, is a CNN correspondent. This pattern is not unique to Obama officials. George Stephanopoulos, co-anchor of ABC's Good Morning America, was a former senior Clinton White House adviser and member of the famous Clinton War Room. The pattern of an incestuous relationship between Democrat administrations and big media is long and robust. Many believe that the mainstream media are an arm of the Democratic Party. Or vice versa. K Street lobbyists are an arm of the U.S. Congress, or vice versa. That's the way Washington, D.C. works. Laws could be written to prevent such a revolving door, but in a free society, people are free to work where they want, but that's another discussion. For CNN to be outraged over a former Trump administration official joining its ranks is both hypocritical and silly. It does clearly illustrate where CNN comes down on news versus politics. Only in the hyper-partisan world of CNN could the hiring of a seemingly smart and accomplished Trump administration official be controversial and worthy of outrage. There are plenty of things for CNN staffers to be ""up in arms"" about, but this is not one of them. Too bad they slept through all the real outrages and woke up only when their far-left political bubble is poked by someone they perceive as a political enemy, once again reinforcing their reputation as fake news.

Behind him stood an arc of Chicago Police Department detectives who had worked the case.

First, though, Johnson had to get something off his chest: “As I look into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention.” Johnson was professional in his demeanor, yet justifiably livid that his police department wasted three weeks investigating a shocking report of racist and homophobic violence that police now say was a hoax.

Police say Smollett wanted to give his career a boost, so he hired two brothers he knew in order to stage a fake attack one early January morning. One theatrical element: hanging a noose around Smollett’s neck. Somehow, Smollett allegedly figured, the incident would generate headlines and sympathy, leading to a pay raise.

So the actor, who appears on the Chicago-filmed show “Empire,” filed a police report claiming two unknown assailants attacked him, shouted slurs and asserted that “This is MAGA Country,” a reference to President Trump. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500, Johnson said, with a promise of $500 later.

Cities aren’t living beings, but if there are rare moments that bind a community in shared emotions, Chicagoans are feeling what Johnson was expressing: dismay and anger at Smollett’s alleged transgression.

Because of the manpower the Chicago Police Department deployed to uncover a publicity stunt.

Because of the possibility the next report of a hate crime somewhere in the country might not be taken seriously.

Because of Smollett’s callous disregard for America’s painful struggle with racism. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson wondered.

The intersection of race, crime and policing is so fraught in Chicago that Johnson surprised us by speaking so bluntly. Gun violence is endemic to impoverished minority neighborhoods. Those are the same communities where too many homicide cases go unsolved and where many residents feel alienated by the Chicago Police Department’s troubling history of abuse. Johnson could have kept to the script by only discussing Smollett, but he noted instead how people in those neighborhoods were again being sidelined so he could answer media questions about a Hollywood actor’s alleged fraud.

Police time and attention were not directly shifted from homicide and shooting investigations to the Smollett case, he insisted, but “those are resources and time spent that we’ll never get back.” That includes time taken for an obligatory news conference.

Smollett turned himself in to police early Thursday to appear for a bond hearing on a felony charge that accuses him of filing a false police report. And as Johnson appropriately asserted, Smollett needs to apologize for dragging Chicago through this needless scandal.

We continue to hope Smollett explains what he did and why. We also hope that arc of detectives who stood behind Johnson – the cops who learned that the hate crime riveting America allegedly was a hoax – quickly return to solving real crimes, with real victims.

When Chicago police charged Jussie Smollett — a black and gay actor, who reported he had been attacked by two white men with a rope, shouting homophobic and racist slurs — with filing a false police report this week, the news landed like a lighted match in a well-stocked tinderbox.

Smollett has denied wrongdoing. But after recent months filled with acts of public bigotry and indifference caught on tape and insensitivity packaged as consumer goods, the entire Smollett affair has stoked the fire inside America’s now constant outrage machine. And it’s spread the flames of discord that some experts warn are engulfing reason and destroying ideological barriers between the middle and the extreme.

Smollett’s alleged fabrication “is the worst possible thing at the worst possible time,” said Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

The possibility that Smollett just took America and, in particular, black and/or gay Americans, inside a fantasy curated from multiple real events, hate crimes and murders during the Trump era could discourage victims of hate crime from coming forward, for fear they won’t be believed, experts say. It could influence the way that officials respond to reports and could fuel long-running white nationalist claims that all hate crimes are hoaxes designed to batter white America. And it could intensify some of the ugliest features of America’s obsession with scandal, celebrity and insta-outrage, just when thought deeper than a puddle is most needed.

“Listen, people do make up stories,” said Katheryn Russell-Brown, who directs the University of Florida Law School’s Center for the Study of Race and Race Relations and wrote a book examining scandals and crimes involving racial hoaxes.

“They do, on occasion, make up all kinds of crime,” continued Russell-Brown, “but no one ever says that because some fires turn out to be arsons no one should respond, write about, look closely at business fires. Just because some stories are not true, they should not drown out every fact, every bit of solid research, every tragic and real experience of hate crime.”

An American tradition

Long before Smollett told “Good Morning America” viewers he’d been targeted by what he believed to be racist and homophobic Trump supporters armed with a noosed-up rope and bleach, hate crimes have marked major moments in the nation’s history. The 16th Street Church bombing, attempted attacks on Ruby Bridges while trying to walk into an integrated public school and the brutal murders of Emmett Till, James Byrd Jr. and Matthew Shepard rank among the things those outside the United States know about the country.

But the idea that hate crime wounds individuals and society, meriting harsher punishment, is relatively new. It took root first in California in 1984. Today, the federal government, 45 states and the District of Columbia maintain laws that punish criminal activity motivated in whole or part by the victim’s race, religion or gender with longer prison terms than other offenses. Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina and Wyoming do not. Even among states with hate crime laws, just 30 states and the federal government include specific prohibitions on crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity.

After Chicago police revealed the allegations against Smollett, the New York Anti-Violence project, which works to offer free counseling and eliminate violence and crime directed at LGBTQ and HIV-positive individuals, issued a statement. It described the possibility that Smollett fabricated a hate crime as unfortunate in a country particularly dangerous for LGBTQ people, in particular those who are people of color.

“Far too many survivors aren’t believed and don’t get justice for the violence they experience,” the group said. “That’s why we are quick to affirm and believe survivors when they share their stories. For many LGBTQ people across this country, hate violence on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, race and a combination of all of those identities is a daily experience. Increasingly, these experiences with hate violence end up being fatal. ...These truths musn’t be overshadowed under these unique circumstances.”

Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson — who leads a force where a former white officer was recently imprisoned for murdering a black and mentally ill teen, detectives have one of the nation’s lowest homicide solve rates and investigations have revealed that officers, in the past, operated secret torture sites — also expressed outrage over the nature of Smollett’s alleged crime.

“Why would anyone — especially an African-American man — use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?” Johnson said Thursday in a news conference after Smollett’s arrest. “Bogus police reports cause real harm,” Johnson added. “They do harm to every legitimate victim who's in need of support by police and investigators, as well as the citizens of this city.”

In circles concerned with the nation’s sustained three-year spike in hate crimes, the Smollett case landed at a moment when policy gains seem imminent — but not a foregone conclusion, Levin said.

In Indiana, a state that at one point amounted to a stronghold for the KKK and in 2015 passed a law that critics said legalized discrimination against LGBTQ peopole, the state’s Republican governor committed himself to implementing hate crimes legislation. Many business and civil rights groups applauded. But the very day Smollett happened to be in court in neighboring Illinois, Indiana’s Republican-controlled Senate passed a hate crime bill that stripped out a specific ban on LGBTQ, racial and religious hate crimes, and targeted general “bias” crime instead.

The truth becomes a lie

Resistance to hate crime policy is far from new. Since at least the 1980s, white supremacists have rallied around the idea that all, or at least most, hate crimes are elaborate hoaxes, cudgels to guilt white Americans and diminish white influence. In that crowd, hate crime data generated by the FBI is part of the hoax — unreliable, inaccurate and politically motivated by organizations tracking hate groups.

White nationalists have worked hard to push those concepts from insider conversations and websites like VDare and American Renaissance into the mainstream, said Heidi Beirich, who leads the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which tracks and monitors hate groups and crimes.

And, in some ways, it’s worked, she said. The notion of pervasive hate crime hoaxes has, for years, been a “near obsession” on alt-right and far-right sites such as Breitbart, the Gateway Pundit, The Daily Caller and Big League Politics, the website that recently unearthed the Virginia governor’s history with blackface, Beirich said.

This week, the claims that most or all hate crime is fake, victims and researchers are grifters and opportunists who intentionally overstate its frequency, went even more mainstream, airing on Fox News and appearing in Reason, a libertarian publication. Ann Coulter also endorsed the same view.

""There’s simply no factual basis to claim false hate crime reports are rampant.""

“Obviously, I hate the fact that Jussie Smollett lied,” Beirich said based on the Chicago police’s account. “It is going to give people ammunition to claim that all hate crimes are fake, all hate crime are lies. So, of course we are upset with Smollett for doing this, for opening this door even wider.”

Hoaxes do happen

Levin, the California hate crimes researcher, is one of the few people in the country who has studied alleged hate crimes that turn out to be hoaxes. That’s something the FBI does not track.

It’s a problem Levin describes as very small.

In 2016 and 2017, 40 reports — 0.3 percent — out of 13,296 hate crimes recorded by the FBI proved false, based on subsequent news reports uncovered by Levin and his team.

“There’s simply no factual basis to claim false hate crime reports are rampant,” Levin said.

Russell-Brown, author of “The Color of Crime: Racial Hoaxes, White Fear, Black Protectionism, Police Harassment, and Other Macroaggressions,” has looked for the common denominators in these rare racial hoaxes.

Her research has shown that about two-thirds of the more than 100 major racial hoaxes she has studied in the last three decades have involved white Americans who claim to have been victimized by black people. The remainder are shaped more like the Smollett story, with people of color claiming to be victimized by whites. The hoaxers fall into two general categories: those who weave racial hoaxes to cover a crime or evade responsibility and those who make up racial hoaxes to gain attention, money or influence. Levin also found insular progressive communities where sympathy and concern about hate crime tends to run high, such as college campuses, produce a disproportionate number of the false hate crime reports.

Among the cases Russell-Brown studied, none of the black hoaxers have ever acknowledged that they lied.Some of the hoaxers Russell-Brown researched have been fined or billed for wasted resources. None have been jailed for the hoax or deceit, only the crimes they were trying to cover up. (If convicted, Smollett faces up to three years behind bars.)

“I’m not, in any way, saying that he does not merit punishment because I think he does,” Russell-Brown said. “There is something particularly pernicious about Smollett’s actions given the volume of attacks on blacks and gays. ... But I am saying that it will be curious if Smollett winds up the one person to serve jail time.”

Extended damage

In the days after Smollett’s first account of the alleged hate crime became public, a number of public figures, including at least three presidential candidates and people working for some of the nation’s leading civil rights organizations, condemned the attack, calling for compassion and a meaningful investigation. Those comments have since met a wall of schadenfreude, anger and chastisement.

President Donald Trump, a frequent voice for false claims that immigrants and black Americans represent a criminal threat, criticized Smollett for his “racism.” Trump also called out Smollett for claiming that his attackers shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign slogan.

But some of Smollett's powerful early supporters have since remained silent, an approach that can undermine their credibility in responding to future hate crimes, Russell-Brown said.

And if that silence extends into the future — if public officials become overly cautious about expressing concern over reported hate crimes, or journalists become hesitant in reporting on victims — carnage can hide in plain sight. Public advocacy, research and training for investigators is essential. Black Americans were disproportionately likely to be killed by police long before the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests, but it was only after that activism that the issues of policing were more closely tracked and examined. Sexual harassment was endemic in the workplace well before #MeToo, but it was only after the en masse breaking of the silence that men were held accountable in large numbers.

It’s hard to tell how lasting the impact of the Smollett hoax will be, Russell-Brown said.

The first test will be how quickly the news cycle moves on. The other, she said, will materialize “in what happens the next time someone says something bad happened to them.”

Following a wild weekend of Abel and Ola Osundairo going from suspects in the alleged hate crime attack on Jussie Smollett in Chicago on January 29, to the Nigerian brothers who were born in the Windy City, telling Chicago Police Department that Smollett paid them $3,500 to orchestrate the attack, the entire focus of the crime has shifted. The latest reports now claim Smollett staged the attack after a racist letter sent to the “Empire” TV studio, which contained a white powder, that turned out to be aspirin, did not get a bigger reaction, according to CBS Chicago. In the wake of these alleged allegations, scenes on “Empire” that featured Smollett have been drastically cut. Smollett’s attorneys insist their client “is a victim and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

• A former American Idol and Fear Factor contestant who was arrested last year in Virginia with nearly 2 pounds of fentanyl will be allowed to live with her parents in New Jersey while awaiting trial. Antonella Barba, 32, was released Thursday after being fitted with a monitor to ensure she follows curfew. Barba was indicted this month on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, heroin and fentanyl. Prosecutors say she was a courier for a drug ring. She was previously charged with shoplifting in New York and has a felony marijuana case pending in Kansas. Barba reached the top 16 on American Idol in 2007, the year Jordin Sparks won. She competed on Fear Factor in 2012. Her attorney, James Broccoletti, declined to comment.

The announcement comes a day after Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the Fox series, was arrested and released on USD 10,000 bond on suspicion of filing a false report about an incident on January 29 where the actor had claimed that he was attacked by two men screaming racial and homophobic slurs while leaving a restaurant in Chicago.

A spokesperson would not comment on whether already-shot scenes will be cut, altered or reduced.

It was later reported that the actor may have been misleading the police, who believed that he may have paid two Nigerian brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to rehearse and stage the attack.

The brothers were arrested and later released without charge and are now believed to be assisting police in the investigation.

Officials also believe that Smollett is involved in crafting a threatening ransom note-style letter that was sent to the ""Empire"" production offices a week before the alleged attack.

The crime carries a felony charge, and if Smollett is found guilty he could face up to three years in prison and up to USD 25,000 in fine.

The actor had earlier denied the Chicago Police claims that he paid two Nigerian brothers to attack him.

The producers of the Fox television program, on which Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, had repeatedly expressed their support for the actor prior to the police allegations that the attack was a hoax. (READ: Police slam Jussie Smollett, saying he staged racist attack to 'boost career')

But on Friday, they said in a statement that they had ""decided to remove the role"" from the final two episodes of the current season ""to avoid further disruption on set.""

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us, the producers said while adding that Smollett was ""an important member of our EMPIRE family.""

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

Chris Alexander, a 20th Century Fox TV spokesman, told AFP that Smollett was not being permanently removed from the program at this point.

Smollett was arrested Thursday and charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was freed on a $100,000 bond.

The actor's lawyers maintained his innocence and accused law enforcement of wanting to ""skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

Law enforcement officials said the allegations against the actor were backed by evidence such as a cashed check, text messages and phone records. – Rappler.com"

Behind him stood an arc of Chicago Police Department detectives who had worked the case.

First, though, Johnson had to get something off his chest: ""As I look into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention."" Johnson was professional in his demeanor, yet justifiably livid that his Police Department wasted three weeks investigating a shocking report of racist and homophobic violence that police now say was a hoax.

Police say Smollett wanted to give his career a boost, so he hired two brothers he knew in order to stage a fake attack one early January morning in the Streeterville neighborhood. One theatrical element: hanging a noose around Smollett's neck. Somehow, Smollett allegedly figured, the incident would generate headlines and sympathy, leading to a pay raise. So the actor, who appears on the Chicago-filmed show ""Empire,"" filed a police report claiming two unknown assailants attacked him, shouted slurs and asserted that ""This is MAGA Country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump. Smollett paid the brothers $3,500, Johnson said, with a promise of $500 later.

Cities aren't living beings, but if there are rare moments that bind a community in shared emotions, Chicagoans are feeling what Johnson was expressing: dismay and anger at Smollett's alleged transgression.

Because of the manpower CPD deployed to uncover a publicity stunt.

Because of the possibility the next report of a hate crime somewhere in the country might not be taken seriously.

Police time and attention were not directly shifted from homicide and shooting investigations to the Smollett case, Johnson insisted, but ""those are resources and time spent that we'll never get back."" That includes time taken for an obligatory news conference.

Smollett turned himself in to police early Thursday to appear for a bond hearing on a felony charge that accuses him of filing a false police report. And as Johnson appropriately asserted, Smollett needs to apologize for dragging Chicago through this needless scandal.

We continue to hope Smollett explains what he did and why. We also hope that arc of detectives who stood behind Johnson--the cops who learned that the hate crime riveting America allegedly was a hoax--quickly return to solving real crimes, with real victims.

The announcement came a day after Smollett surrendered to police; appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct related to the reported filing of a false police report; and left jail after posting bond. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,"" Empire executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season."" The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged. Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry. Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where Empire is shot, police said. Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor's salary.

Epix has since pulled the episode featuring the actor after Jussie was arrested and charged for filing a false police report.

Breitbart.com reports: Jussie Smollett appeared in a documentary that specifically touched upon the topic of lynching last May, according to a report by Variety. The Empire actor was a narrator and correspondent in an episode of the Epix documentary series, “America Divided.”

The episode’s director, Lucian Read, told Variety that he was horrified when Smollett’s story initially came out, adding that for him, it was “hard to get away from the coincidence.”

“Of course in this country we believe in innocent until proven guilty and all that,” said Read, “but assuming the allegations are true, I wonder whether coincidence is the right word — to take this truth and turn it into a fiction like that, it’s remarkable.”

Smollett had initially reported that he had been attacked by two men wearing masks, who threw bleach on him and put a rope around his neck.

The actor’s story caused many members in Hollywood, the mainstream media, and the Democrat Party to immediately and uncritically react, spurring a national frenzy.

Newly announced Democrat 2020 presidential candidates, such as Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, quickly reacted by calling Smollet’s unverified story an “attempted modern day lynching,” and demanding that Congress pass an anti-lynching bill.

Now, the actor has been arrested and charged with one count of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report, as Chicago police say that new evidence suggests that Smollett had staged his own attack.

Read told Variety that the actor had been “a pleasure to work with,” and that he and the producers are still “very proud” of the episode that had been hosted by Smollett, despite the “crazy” and “strange” recent developments.

“We really believed it was the strongest episode in the series and explored issues that need to be discussed in this country,” said Read, “Jussie and all of us were extremely committed to making a great show.”

The network has since reportedly pulled the episode, stating, “In light of – and with respect to – the sensitivities around recent events, we can confirm that Epix is no longer making available the episode of ‘America Divided’ featuring Jussie Smollett.”"

CHICAGO — “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack because he was unhappy about his salary and wanted to promote his career, Chicago’s police superintendent said Thursday.

Before the attack, Smollett also sent a threatening letter that targeted himself to the Fox studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed, Supt. Eddie Johnson said.

Smollett turned himself in and was arrested early Thursday to face accusations that he filed a false police report when he told authorities he was attacked in Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

“He took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,” Johnson told reporters at a news conference.

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve,” he later added.

The whispers about Smollett’s account started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police after telling authorities he was attacked. Then detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the beating. Later, two brothers were taken into custody for questioning but were released after two days, with police saying they were no longer suspects. Johnson said Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to stage the attack.

Smollett turned himself in early Thursday to face accusations that he filed a police report when he told authorities he was attacked in Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.

Smollett turned himself in at central booking, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was scheduled to hold a Thursday morning news conference to announce Smollett’s arrest and Smollett was expected to appear in court later in the day.

The whispers about Smollett started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police after telling authorities he was attacked. Then detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the beating. Later, two brothers were taken into custody for questioning but were released after two days, with police saying they were no longer suspects.

Following three weeks of mounting suspicions, Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report, a charge that could bring up to three years in prison and force the actor, who is Black and gay, to pay for the cost of the investigation into his report of a Jan. 29 beating.

In less than a month, the 36-year-old changed from being the seemingly sympathetic victim of a hate crime to being accused of fabricating the entire thing.

The felony disorderly conduct charge emerged on the same day detectives and the two brothers testified before a grand jury. Smollett’s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting.

In a statement, attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said Smollett “enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.”

The announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy police interviews of the brothers, a search of their home and their release after officers cleared them.

Investigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett’s account — something police signaled Friday when they announced a “significant shift in the trajectory” of the probe after the brothers were freed.

Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show “Empire,” said he was attacked Jan. 29 as he was walking home from a downtown Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” — before fleeing.

Police said one of the men had appeared on “Empire,” and Smollett’s attorneys said one of the men is the actor’s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, “Sum of My Music,” last year.

Smollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to “lock in their testimony.”

Speaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers’ attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.

“There was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we’re going to correct this,” Gloria Schmidt said.

She said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. “You don’t need immunity when you have the truth,” she said.

She also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.

But several hours after Smollett was declared a suspect and the charges announced, there was little reaction from celebrities online.

Former Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.

Smollett has a record — one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.

Another prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

The size of the tab is anyone’s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.

Weisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O’Hare Airport.

For an investigation that took a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett’s case, “I can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.”"

Ashlee Rezin / Chicago Sun-Times via AP

CHICAGO — The story Jussie Smollett told police had it all: racism, homophobia, politics, celebrity — all tied up with a hangman's noose. There was no question the news coverage was going to be massive.

In many ways, that coverage is an object lesson in the foibles of modern reporting. The story showed where news outlets teeter on the line between driving social media and being driven by it, between healthy skepticism and cautious credulity.

""We have the combination of social media and a polarized country converging here,"" said Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Everyone is seeing events ""from their political lens. No one is really good at distancing themselves.""

The story began as an account of a hate crime that went viral instantly.

A star of the hit Fox television show ""Empire,"" Smollett reported that he had been attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 on his way home from a sandwich shop. Smollett — who, like his character, is black and gay — said two masked men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured bleach on him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck.

He also claimed they shouted, ""This is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

National media soon got wind of the story. Social media poured rocket fuel on it and set it ablaze.

Celebrities including ""Empire"" co-star Vivica A. Fox and Oscar winner Viola Davis tweeted their love and support. Talk show host Andy Cohen, who is also gay, tweeted simply: ""This. Is. Vile.""

Within hours, now Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — both African-American — compared the attack to an ""attempted modern-day lynching."" Even President Donald Trump seemed to take the story at face value.

But as police searched for surveillance footage of the attack, people began to wonder. Two men seen in a video went from being persons of interest to suspects, then to witnesses against Smollett.

It all came crashing down Thursday, when the 36-year-old actor turned himself in and was charged with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that alleges he made a false police report. Police claim Smollett staged the attack, enlisting two brothers who were his friends because he was unhappy with his salary.

After Smollett was charged, it seemed people who had been holding back suddenly felt free to admit they had doubts all along.

CNN anchor Don Lemon — who met Smollett during a guest appearance on ""Empire"" — said his initial reaction to the attack was not disbelief but ""sadness.""

""I wasn't shocked,"" Lemon, a black man who came out as gay in 2011, told ""Entertainment Tonight."" ''I didn't like that it happened to him.""

As police waited for Smollett to surrender, Lemon acknowledged Wednesday on CNN that many in the gay and African-American communities ""had questions about this from the very beginning, the veracity of this story.""

It was minus 4 degrees that night.

""And let's be honest,"" Lemon said, ""there are probably not a whole lot of MAGA fans watching 'Empire.'""

But Smollett stuck to his story. And until a couple of weeks in, the media had nothing but a ""gut"" feeling to go on, said Tom Jones, senior media writer for the Florida-based Poynter Institute.

""I think most of the media handled it responsibly, saying, 'Hey look. Here's what the allegations are. Here's what he's saying. Here's what he claimed happened. And then we'll see where the investigation goes from here,'"" Jones said.

""The word 'alleged' was all over any reference from the moment it was first reported,"" Northwestern's Whitaker added. ""I didn't hear a lot of really super-sympathetic coverage.""

Conservative columnist Ben Shapiro disagrees. He told Fox News that the volume of coverage on Smollett was ""enormous"" because ""there's a narrative to be promoted.""

""When a story is too perfect to be true, it usually is, and this is one of those cases,"" he said.

Joe Saltzman said the Smollett story was a case of sheer ""overkill,"" even in this era of the 24-hour news cycle.

""This is not good journalism,"" Saltzman, a professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, wrote in an email. ""This is gossip and chatter.""

Robin Roberts, anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" came in for some of the harshest criticism for a Feb. 14 exclusive interview with Smollett. Many accused her of failing to push him hard enough.

On Thursday's show, Roberts called the situation a ""setback for race relations,"" adding that she ""cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.""

Trump's sympathy for Smollett also evaporated. ""What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?"" he tweeted Thursday, tagging the actor.

Earlier this week, as Smollett's story began to unravel, his siblings took to Instagram.

""This is the media, an irresponsible media,"" Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett posted, using a picture and slightly altered quotation from slain civil rights leader Malcolm X. ""It will make the criminal look like he's the victim and make the victim look like he's the criminal.""

Smollett is free after posting $10,000 in bail, and his attorneys said he maintains his innocence. On Friday, he was cut from the final two episodes of this season of ""Empire.""

During a news conference announcing the charges, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson surveyed the packed room of reporters.

""I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,"" he said angrily."

The brothers from Nigeria, Olabinjo “Ola” and Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo were picked up at O’Hare International Airport, as they were returning from a trip to Nigeria.

Olabinjo has appeared on “Empire” and Abimbola said he’s worked on the show before.

CBS Chicago reports that the two men have now been arrested and TMZ says they were booked for battery.

This development is amidst reports that Jussie allegedly orchestrated the attack so he wouldn’t be written off the show.

Fox had stated that he wasn’t being written off the show and police has said there’s “no evidence” the actor staged the attack.

Jussie described his attackers as white but the Osundairo brothers are black.

Jussie has also been discovered to be following Abel on Instagram.

“When they first learned about what happened to him they were horrified. This is someone they know. This is someone they’ve worked with, so they don’t want to see somebody go through that,” Gloria Schmidt, their attorney told CBS Chicago.

A Chicago law enforcement source told TMZ that the next step may be a lineup in which Jussie will be asked to identify the culprits."

February 22, 2019

By Lloyd Marcus I recently watched the original Jussie Smollett ABC interview on Youtube in which he claimed to have been attacked by racist homophobic Trump supporters.Considering that we now know Jussie staged his attack and has been arrested for filing a false police report https://bit.ly/2XeehvL , I thought, ""This guy should be nominated for an Academy Award."" In his ABC interview, Jussie's sincerity, tears, and portrayal as a suffering, victimized, black homosexual man were insidiously and brilliantly executed. https://bit.ly/2IpRh9L Even though Jussie has been exposed as a liar, will leftists continue to use Jussie's irresponsible hate generating lie to smear Trump and his supporters? Folks, we have seen this kind of leftist propaganda movie before titled ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" starring young black criminal Michael Brown.A police officer attempted to arrest Michael Brown after he robbed a convenience store and assaulted the clerk. At 6 ft 4"" and 292 lbs, Brown wrestled the officer for his gun and was shot and killed. A witness claimed the white cop murdered Brown while he tried to surrender with his hands in the air. Evidence confirmed that the witness lied. Brown's blood was found on the officer's gun and inside his police car, confirming the officer's account of what happened. https://nws.mx/2ElL8r2 Even after the truth about the Brown shooting was exposed, the Grammy Awards irresponsibly did a musical production number further promoting the ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" lie. In essence, the Grammy Awards show cruelly painted targets on the backs of our brave men and women in blue across America. Grammy Awards show producers purposely filled black youths with hatred for police, victim mindsets and hatred for their country based on a proven lie.To this day, leftists are still promoting and many blacks still believe the lie that Michael Brown was shot in cold blood by a racist white cop. Thanks to fake news media, Democrats, and Hollywood, many blacks believe the lie that police routinely murder blacks. Consequently, police are being ambushed and assassinated by blacks seeking revenge. https://nydn.us/2GHd5fs It blows my mind that there was very little fake news media coverage or outrage over a mob of Black Lives Matter thugs marching down a NY street chanting, ""What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!"" https://bit.ly/1BMKT1t Meanwhile, stats confirm that police are the greatest defenders of black lives. https://bit.ly/2pj6TOE Jussie was unsuccessful in his attempt to get his bogus staged attack caught on closed circuit TV. Rush Limbaugh pointed out and I agree that, had Jussie gotten his fake attack on video, fake news media would promote it 24/7 – possibly causing riots and violence across America.When the dust settles, leftists will, more than likely, make Jussie Smollett a hero. Leftists will claim Jussie raised awareness about those routinely abused by racist homophobic Trump supporters.In my opinion, Jussie's insidious fake attack scheme is the equivalent of yelling fire in a crowded auditorium. It could have led to massive racial violence resulting in many Americans being injured and lives lost.I hold no malice against Jussie. I pray that this young man will come to know Jesus, turning his life around. Behavior has consequences. I believe Jussie Smollett should be prosecuted.

Actor Jussie Smollett told cops that he had an untreated drug problem after his arrest, according to a new report.

Though Smollett, 36, continues to deny he staged a racist and anti-gay attack against himself as a hate crime hoax, he confessed to police in Chicago that he struggles with drug issues after his arrest on Thursday, according to TMZ.

Smollett responded 'no' when asked about alcohol or mental health problems, according to booking documents. But he may have dropped hints about a drug issue to lay groundwork for a possible defense strategy.

Meanwhile, stunning details have emerged about the massive technological push that police used to unravel Smollett's claim that he was attacked by two men shouting slogans supporting President Donald Trump on January 29.

Jussie Smollett exits Cook County Jail after posting bail in Chicago on Thursday

Police tapped into Chicago's vast network of surveillance cameras - and even some homeowners' doorbell cameras - to track down two brothers who later claimed they were paid by 'Empire' actor Jussie Smollett to stage an attack on him, the latest example of the city's high-tech approach to public safety.

Officers said they reviewed video from 55 cameras to trace the brothers' movements before and after the reported attack, determining where they lived and who they were before arresting them a little more than two weeks later.

Smollett reported being beaten up by two men who shouted racist and anti-gay slurs and threw bleach on him.

But his story fell apart when Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo - bodybuilders and aspiring actors whom Smollett knew from the 'Empire' set and the gym - told police that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career.

Smollett was arrested Thursday and made his first court appearance. He was later released after posting the required 10 percent of the $100,000 bond.

They worked backwards from the moment of the attack and put together Smollett's movements and those of the two brothers he allegedly paid to attack him

Surveillance footage from businesses and private residences was also used to put it together including the footage taken inside a store on January 28 which shows the brothers buying the items they used

Police Commander Edward Wodnicki, who heads the detective division that led the investigation, credited the camera network but also residents who shared information from their own cameras for helping to solve the case.

'That was super useful in this investigation,' he said of residents' cooperation. 'The city came together to investigate and help the police with this crime.'

The search went beyond surveillance cameras to include other electronic records.

Detectives also reviewed in-car taxi videos, telephone logs, ride-share records and credit card records, according to a summary of the case released by prosecutors.

The biggest break in their case came from the fact the brothers ordered an Uber to pick them up from their home and take them to

At first, police were puzzled when they could not find footage of the attack, which Smollett said occurred around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 while he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop.

Chicago has the most extensive video surveillance network in the U.S., with access to more than 32,000 cameras mounted on buildings, poles, train tunnels and buses - and even in businesses and private residences whose owners agree to opt into the system full-time.

What's more, authorities can track someone by linking those cameras at a sophisticated emergency command center, police stations or even from tablets in officers' squad cars.

Police say Smollett deliberately staged the attack in a spot where he believed it would be captured on video, but 'that particular camera wasn't pointed in that direction,' Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Thursday.

But police soon found footage of two men walking in the area of the attack and interviewed more than 100 people seeking witnesses.

Using 35 police cameras and more than 20 private-sector cameras, investigators were able to trace the men's movements after the attack, including footage of them getting into a cab, Wodnicki said. Detectives interviewed the cab driver, got video from inside the vehicle and followed it along a trail of cameras to the city's North Side, where the brothers got out and began walking.

The private footage offered by residents included video from cameras embedded in doorbells that showed the men walking, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

After that, police tracked the men's movements 'backward to where they came from' before the attack, Wodnicki said - first walking, then to a cab and back to a ride-share car.

'That was the lead we needed to identify a person of interest,' Wodnicki said. 'We were able to put a name to both individuals.'

Police found out the men had flown to Nigeria the same day as the reported attack and would return on Feb. 13. In the meantime, police executed more than 50 search warrants and subpoenas, including for phone and social media records.

The Osundairos were arrested when they got off the plane. Within two days, they were released without charges after detailing the alleged plot orchestrated by Smollett.

Although the camera network - which has raised privacy concerns among some civil liberties groups - was key, it was only one part of the investigation, Guglielmi said.

'Then they just did the police work,' he said. 'It was a lot of digging.'"

Sources told Variety that show chiefs are currently deciding whether to suspend him from the programme but there are currently no plans to change the show's shooting schedule.

WASHINGTON – On Jan. 29, Jussie Smollett, a gay African-American actor, reported to Chicago police that he had been the victim of a vicious hate crime. As my colleague Nana Efua Mumford has noted, the disturbing details were almost cinematic, like an episode of “Empire,” Smollett’s television show. Two masked assailants not only made homophobic, racist slurs, according to Smollett, but also poured an unknown chemical on him and hung a noose around his neck. One of the attackers shouted “This is MAGA country” – as in the Trumpian phrase “Make America Great Again.”

That theatricality, and the timeliness of the political message, ensured the incident would catch the public’s imagination. Now, evidence is emerging that the episode may in fact have been scripted by Smollett himself. On Wednesday evening, Chicago police announced Smollet has been charged with disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Smollett, through his attorneys, has denied participating in a hoax.

Regardless of how the Smollett episode ultimately turns out, it provides a useful reminder: The more a crime report sounds like a movie, the more suspicious you should be.

In Bill James’ 2011 book, “Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence,” he notes of serial killers that “one can almost say accurately that every serial killer in fiction is more organized than any serial killer in real life.” Another way to put it: Fictional killers are unrealistically legible to outside viewers. In real life, after investigating for a year and a half, Las Vegas police still have no idea why Stephen Paddock committed the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

................................................................

James’ dictum applies equally well to other sorts of crimes, particularly when the details seem to serve a larger political narrative.

Hollywood strips away ambiguity and clarifies murky motives, and endows criminals with more planning ability than they usually possess. It heightens dramatic contrasts between villain and victim, and festoons the crime with eye-catching symbolic detail. Real criminals, by contrast, rarely have a simple discernible motive or a narrative arc. Nor can they generally work their crimes up for maximum dramatic effect, because, unlike actors playing criminals on a closed movie set, the real ones need to worry about getting caught.

A look at the most extreme form of hate crimes – domestic right-wing terrorist attacks – reveals the distance between reality and what movies lead us to expect. There are relatively few of what we might call Hollywood Crimes, such as Timothy McVeigh’s bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 or Dylann Roof’s 2015 massacre in an African-American church at Charleston, S.C. Often, the information about the incidents and attackers is so convoluted that it’s not even entirely clear they were primarily motivated by politics.

Or what politics motivate them. Remember the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016? It was initially assumed to be an episode of right-wing homophobic violence. Then the shooter turned out to be an Islamic State follower who may not even have realized he had targeted a gay nightclub until he got there. Real crime, like real life, is complicated and confusing.

And so our spidey sense should tingle when alleged crimes seem ready for prime time. The perpetrators of racial and sexual violence aren’t writing a manifesto; they’re committing assault. Those assaults will rarely be structured to deliver a simple, on-point story: The assault on a lone victim by stereotypically powerful perpetrators; the attackers who helpfully reveal their one-note motive and then shut up; the abundance of stunning detail; the unmistakable connection to a larger political narrative. Or the victim who, like an actor, sustains minimal physical injuries from an apparently gory episode.

These elements should have urged us to caution in the Smollett case right from the start. As they should have in famous recent cases we now know were hoaxes: the confabulated rape accusations against the Duke University men’s lacrosse team in 2006 and a University of Virginia fraternity in 2014, or the rash of slightly-too-on-the-nose hate crime reports following Donald Trump’s election.

Paradoxically, though, bogus attacks may feel more authentic than actual ones because, luckily, most of us know these extreme forms of violence only from what we’ve seen on-screen. We amplify stories that tickle our narrative neurons, overlooking more complicated real attacks where the significance must be explained.

This does a grave disservice to real victims. If we focus on the stories that give us the narratives we’re looking for, we’re going to end up with a disproportionate amount of fiction. And when those widely publicized stories come unglued, we’ll inadvertently feed another false narrative: that racial and sexual violence are fake news, instead of all-too-real problems."

It is important to note that Smollett, through his attorneys and reportedly in person to fellow cast members, has continued to maintain his innocence and has not been convicted.

While talking about the situation, CNN’s Don Lemon and his panel addressed the issue from the standpoint of Smollett being guilty. But something Lemon said about Smollett was so ridiculous that even one of his CNN-employed panelists refused to let it slide by.

“In the court of public opinion, Jussie has lost. He’s lost the fight in the court of public opinion. And that’s where his battle is,” Lemon said.

“Legally, if he has to go, whatever he has to serve, if it’s jail time, if he has to do probation, if he has to pay, whatever,” Lemon continued. “But in the court of public opinion, it matters.”

“And he lost that because of how, and not his fault, maybe people were, I don’t know what they were saying to him, maybe because of his representatives, who knows, it was handled poorly,” Lemon said.

Wait, what? Not Smollett’s fault?

CNN Legal analyst Joey Jackson caught that, too, and immediately set Lemon straight.

“I don’t know if it’s ‘not his fault,’ Don.” Lemon interrupted Jackson, questioning that statement, but Jackson persisted.

“The fact is, well, he went out and he gave the interview (with ABC’s Robin Roberts of ‘Good Morning America’),” Jackson said.

“Understand this, now let’s talk from a defense perspective,” Jackson said. “There’s two things to think about.”

“Number one is the law. Whether it makes sense legally to be out there, speaking and everything else.”

“From that perspective, it’s damning,” Jackson said. “All those things you heard him say on TV are going to be played in a courtroom and the event this goes to trial it’s going to crush him.”

“Now (number two), from a public relation’s imperative, your people say, ‘oh, get in front of the cameras, express what happened, show some, you know, some real anger, and show some this, that, the other.’ The fact is that works from a public relations perspective, but it doesn’t work in this (inaudible),” he said.

As Jackson pointed out, it was Smollett who went on television and told his story. But that isn’t all of it.

Smollett reportedly contacted ABC about doing the interview, not the other way around. And he specifically requested Roberts conduct the interview because she had appeared on “Empire,” so he knew her, AOL reported.

And, in his first concert since the alleged attack, Smollett addressed the matter with the crowd at the 400-capacity club.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I can’t let (them) win,” Smollet said, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“I have so many words in my heart,” he continued. “The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I’m okay.”

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m gonna stand strong with y’all… l will always stand for love,” he said.

“I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love.”

“And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now … let’s do it,” Smollett said.

He said all of those words. If Smollett is lying about the alleged attack and he did perpetrate a crime, losing in the court of public opinion is his fault and his fault alone.

That loss began when he committed a crime and blamed others for it. It continued when he kept playing for sympathy, even though he knew better.

Many people - especially celebrities - had given him their support until the whole story turned around and they now poke fun at the ""Empire"" actor's alleged attempt to fake a hate crime, reportedly because he was not satisfied with his salary.

Trevor Noah asked on ""The Daily Show"": ""This dude may have faked a hate crime just to get a raise?""

""What's the logic there? You get your ass beaten and then you go to your boss and go, 'Hey, I need another million dollars, I need to buy some band-aids?' What was the thinking? That's not a good way to get a raise, people.""

In his usual manner, Noah went on to give out ideas on how he should have gone about it.

""I mean call me old-fashioned, but whatever happened to just going into your boss' office and blackmailing him with nudes?"" Noah asked.

""This is such a petty reason to pull off such a major crime. Imagine if we found out the reason Tupac faked his own death was to get out of a Blockbuster late fee.""

""They're saying he paid his accomplices with a check,"" Noah continued after a reel showed news clips detailing the many incriminating pieces of evidence the police have reportedly found. ""What, did he also write 'fake hate crime' in the memo? Even amateurs know, if you commit a crime, you go all cash people!""

""You've never seen a movie where the bad guys are like, 'I need you to get rid of someone for me. Now who do I make this check out to?'""

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,"" ''Empire"" executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged. At this point, Smollett is part of the seven already completed episodes.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout ""MAGA country"" and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

""I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,"" police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. ""But unfortunately that particular camera wasn't pointed in that direction.""

Smollett's legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a ""man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence."" The statement called Johnson's news conference ""an organized law enforcement spectacle.""

""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,"" the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor's salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on ""Empire"" received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama's renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars."

5am – D IRS employee accused of leaking Michael Cohen’s bank records to Michael Avenatti. (Fox News) — A veteran IRS employee has been charged with leaking the banking records of President Trump’s onetime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. John C. Fry, 54, was charged with one count of unlawful disclosure of information obtained from so-called Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and was released on $50,000 bond after appearing in federal court in San Francisco. According to an affidavit by Linda Cieslak, a special agent with the U.S. Department of Treasury, Fry repeatedly searched law enforcement databases for information relating to Cohen. Fry, an investigative analyst for the IRS’ law enforcement arm who has worked for the agency since 2008, is accused of gaining access to five SARs, which are filed by banks when transactions are spotted that raise questions about possible financial misconduct. One of the reports Fry allegedly accessed showed Cohen’s Essential Consultants had received a total of $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a company associated with Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who donated money to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other payments to Essential Consultants came from AT&T ($200,000) and pharmaceutical company Novartis (approximately $399,920). Cieslak said Fry called Avenatti from his cellphone three separate times and relayed the information from the SARs to the attorney verbally. The agent added that Fry admitted to doing so when investigators confronted him in November.

5am – E Judge puts strict gag order on Roger Stone, allows him to remain out of jail. (NBC News) — After a lawyer for Stone called his since-deleted Instagram post “indefensible,” the judge said, “I agree with you there.” A federal judge banned Roger Stone from speaking publicly about his case on Thursday, after hauling him back to court to answer for an Instagram post attacking her. “Publicity cannot subside if it’s the defendant that’s fanning the flames,” U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Thursday, making it clear that a violation of the strict gag order would mean jail for the former Trump adviser. “Today, I gave you a second chance. This is not baseball, you don’t get a third chance,” she told Stone. Stone can still raise funds for his legal defense and maintain his innocence publicly, but he cannot comment on the case or its participants, the judge said. Before issuing her ruling, Jackson said Stone “couldn’t keep his story straight on the stand” when she allowed him the opportunity to explain his decision to post an image of her on Instagram with what appeared to be the crosshairs of a gun near her head. His apology, she said, rang “hollow.” The Instagram post in question, posted to Stone’s account earlier this week, was accompanied by a caption in which he suggested Jackson was politically biased, slammed Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and sought donations for his legal defense. Stone later said his post wasn’t meant to be threatening and deleted it. “I am hurtfully sorry for my own stupidity. I am kicking myself, not as much as my wife is kicking me,” Stone told the court Thursday. He called the Instagram post “a momentary lapse of judgment” before saying that the photo was selected by someone who works for him, which he estimated was about “five or six people.”

6am – D Police Seek Help Identifying Suspect in Attack on Conservative Activist at UC Berkeley. (NBC) — University of California at Berkeley police are asking for help identifying a man suspected of injuring another man at a table for a conservative student group on Upper Sproul Plaza. Someone called police at 3:29 p.m. Tuesday to report a disturbance on the plaza. A UC Berkeley student who witnessed the attack told officers that two men had been fighting. On the plaza, officers found an injured man who said he had been punched several times. The victim told police he was at a table for the student group Turning Point USA when two men came up to the table and started arguing. The victim started filming the argument with his phone and apparently a fight began when one of the two men slapped the phone out of the victim’s hand. The suspect knocked over the table for Turning Point and the pair struggled over the phone. Then the suspect punched the victim several times, injuring the man’s nose and eye, police said.

6am – E Alabama ISIS bride’s father sues Trump administration over citizenship and seeks her return. (CNN)The father of the Alabama woman who joined ISIS is suing the Trump administration over her US citizenship and seeking her return. Ahmed Ali Muthana filed a lawsuit on Thursday in federal court in Washington, DC, to prevent what he calls an “unlawful attempt” by the United States to rescind his daughter’s citizenship. At age 19, Hoda Muthana, who is from Hoover, Alabama, traveled to Syria to join ISIS. Five years later, Muthana now says she regrets what she did and wants to return to the United States. President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that he directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to allow Muthana back into the country. Pompeo declared the same day, in a statement, that Muthana is “not a US citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid US passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States.” The lawsuit filed by her father “seeks injunctive relief preventing the United States government from unconstitutionally robbing (Muthana and her son) of their rights as United States citizens,” according to the court document filed Thursday. He is requesting the court “find the US government has an obligation to assist in the return of its citizens from areas of armed conflict.” The lawsuit was filed against Trump, Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr. If she returns to the United States, Muthana “is prepared and willing to surrender to any charges the United States Justice Department finds appropriate and necessary,” according to the lawsuit. In a handwritten statement provided to CNN by a family representative, Muthana wrote that when she left for Syria she was a “naive, angry, and arrogant young woman.”

6am – F NAVRATILOVA KICKED OFF LGBTQ ORGANIZATION BOARD:

BIO: Martina Navratilova is a former Czechoslovak and later American professional tennis player and coach. In 2005, Tennis magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1975 through 2005 and she is considered one of the best, if not the best, female tennis players of all time.

Martina Navratilova is a former Czechoslovak and later American professional tennis player and coach. In 2005, Tennis magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1975 through 2005 and she is considered one of the best, if not the best, female tennis players of all time. EARLIER THIS WEEK: Martina Navratilova has claimed that allowiing transgender women to compete in professional is “insane and cheating”. The legendary tennis player who came out as a lesbian in 1981 , said competing against trans women who still had “biologically” male bodies made a mockery of women’s sport. “I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair,” Navratilova wrote in The Sunday Times. “To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires. It’s insane and it’s cheating.”

The legendary tennis player , said competing against trans women who still had “biologically” male bodies made a mockery of women’s sport. Navratilova wrote in The Sunday Times. Navratalova, who won 18 grand slam titles in a 30-year career at the top of the sport, also criticised the “tyranny” and “bullying” she had received from trans activists since she started publicly raising her concerns last year.

Martina Navratilova Removed From Board Of LGBTQ Organization. Tennis legend Martina Navratilova was officially removed Wednesday from the advisory board of a prominent LBGTQ organization after making comments about transgender athletes. Athlete Ally announced in a statement Feb. 20 that Navratilova would be removed as an ambassador and from the advisory board immediately. The organization stated the comments made by the tennis legend were “transphobic” and based on a misunderstanding of science.

7am – E FAIRFAX ACCUSER VANESSA TYSON CALLS OUT VIRGINIA GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR FAILURE TO ACT. Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax accuser, Vanessa Tyson, released a statement Thursday condemning the Virginia General Assembly for its failure to act meaningfully regarding her allegations against the governor. Despite calls from both Fairfax accusers, Tyson and Meredith Watson, legislative leaders have failed to pursue appropriate action, according to an official statement from the law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, which is representing Tyson. The law firm represented Christine Blasey Ford in hearings regarding allegations brought against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “[T]he Virginia General Assembly has remained silent and has taken no action whatsoever in response to her allegations, even after a second woman, Meredith Watson, came forward to report that Lt. Governor Fairfax raped her while they were students at Duke University in 2000,” the statement reads. While lawmakers in both parties have responded with words of concern, they have utterly failed to act and have stood idly by as Lt. Governor Fairfax has impugned Dr. Tyson’s actions as being politically motivated; verbally attacked Dr. Tyson and Ms. Watson; [and] threatened to file criminal charges against Dr. Tyson if she pursues criminal charges against him. … It now appears that the Virginia General Assembly lacks the political courage to establish a process by which Dr. Tyson and Ms. Watson’s serious allegations of sexual violence suffered at the hands of Lt. Governor Fairfax will be fully investigated. We ask the members of the Virginia General Assembly to consider what message such inaction sends to victims of sexual assault and rape. Tyson alleges that Fairfax assaulted her while they were at a Democratic National Convention in 2004. Fairfax has vehemently denied the allegations and maintains their encounter was consensual.

New York (CNN Business) Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank has been soliciting business advice from MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Under Armour employees were uncomfortable with the relationship, according to the newspaper, which also said that Ruhle traveled with Plank and Under Armour staff on a private jet he leases to the company. The Journal cited a number of anonymous sources, including what it described as current and former executives, as well as “others familiar with the matter.” The newspaper reported that Plank took Ruhle’s advice, rather than Under Armour management’s, about how to handle customer backlash over a version of basketball star Stephen Curry’s sneakers in 2016. She also advised Plank on how to deal with President Donald Trump in 2017, according to the article. Plank and other high-profile business leaders quit Trump’s manufacturing council that year after Trump failed to condemn white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Former and current executives said Mr. Plank’s use of the jet and his relationship with Ms. Ruhle were among the many ways the CEO blurred the lines between his personal activities and Under Armour,” the Journal reported. Under Armour’s (UAA) board of directors reviewed emails between the two last year, and asked Plank about the relationship and “whether company assets were used,” according to the Journal. Plank told them no company funds were spent. The Journal could not determine whether the board took additional action.

Any ordinary allegation that Kraft solicited prostitution in a Florida massage parlor would have generated a stream of one-liners about “deflated balls” and “post-Super Bowl happy endings” from Patriots fans proud that their team owner could still deliver at age 77.

And a chorus of millions chanting, “Eww, gross.”

Kraft’s name and the term “sex-trafficking ring” will now never be more than a few sentences apart in any biography. They are, whether you like it or not, forever linked. This is true even though there is no indication Kraft was aware of the sex-trafficking portion of this lurid alleged tale.

The “presumption of innocence” guides our legal system. But its place in American discourse disappeared once the lies from the fourth Brett Kavanaugh accuser showed up on NBC News. It was buried beneath the Lincoln Memorial along with reputations of the boys from Covington Catholic. Jussie Smollett used it to ignite our country’s racial tinder.

It, thankfully, remains viable here.

Less than two hours after news broke that Kraft was facing two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Fla., and was allegedly caught “receiving a sex act” on video tape, “Free Kraft” T-shirts were available for $28 at BarstoolSports.com.

“El Presidente“ takes no days off.

The mantra from Bangor to Bridgeport was as predictable as winter weather.

“The NFL will use this to screw the Patriots. Somehow. Someway. Someday.”

Kraft’s local reputation may emerge unscathed, if not emboldened, depending on how his case is adjudicated. For many, many more, he’s now a dirty old man.

Whatever the NFL does to Kraft will have a minimal effect on the day-to-day operations of the Patriots given the ever-growing role of Jonathan Kraft and omniscient presence of Bill Belichick.

This entire drama begins and ends with Kraft’s guilt or innocence, which he has proclaimed. The legal issue is now the domain of his lawyers and prosecutors in Florida’s 15th Judicial Circuit.

Kraft faces up to a year in jail if convicted on both misdemeanor counts of solicitation of prostitution. Ponder that for a minute. It won’t happen. But it could.

Things just got serious.

Every person convicted of solicitation in Florida must complete 100 hours of community service, attend a prostitution and human trafficking awareness course, undergo screening for sexually transmissible diseases, and pay a $5,000 civil fine.

The details of the alleged sex trafficking that spread from China to New York to South Florida are a chilling reminder that this is not a victimless crime. At least six women were forced into graphic sexual acts, slept on massage tables and worked around the clock, police said. Some serviced up to 1,500 men each year.

In all, 25 men were charged with solicitation. Daniel Young turns 85 a week from Sunday. The others include Richard Palmer and John Johnson. They sound like co-stars of a 1970’s porn flick. Kraft’s name reportedly may not even be the biggest involved. Your imagination can fill those blanks.

President Trump — in another shocking development — cogently spoke for many when asked about his pal.

“It’s very sad. I was very surprised to see it,” Trump said. “He’s proclaimed his innocence, totally, but I am very surprised to see it.”

Kraft’s neighbor in Brookline told NBC Boston: “Robert Kraft isn’t a good man … he’s a great man.”

A great man? Perhaps.

But one who is forever tarnished.

BIG WEEKEND FOR THE UNITED METHODISTS…

Today is the day when the United Methodist Church meets for a special General Conference, where they will hold a critical vote on whether to ordain openly gay clergy and allow individual churches to conduct same-sex marriages.

At First Things, Dale M. Coulter outlines the three options being put before the UMC:

Last July, the Council of Bishops offered three possible plans for moving forward: the One Church Plan, the Connectional Conference Plan, and the Traditional Plan. The One Church Plan calls for removing language from the Book of Discipline that upholds traditional teaching on sexuality, and allowing individual churches and conferences to decide on the basis of conscience whether they will permit same-sex unions or homosexual bishops. The Connectional Conference Plan calls for completely reorganizing the regional conferences around shared beliefs rather than geography—in other words, creating traditionalist and progressive conferences and trying to hold them together. The Modified Traditional Plan calls for upholding the traditional teaching on sexuality and then offering an exit path for any local churches or conferences that disagree. Even though the bishops offered three plans, most have come out in support of the One Church Plan, even creating a website to push it. They hope this plan will preserve the denomination’s unity by allowing individual churches and ministers the freedom to follow their own theological convictions. Most of the traditionalists urge adoption of the Modified Traditional Plan—traditionalists that include organizations like the Wesleyan Covenant Association and the Africa Initiative Group, which represents many African Methodists.

RNS tells of a prayer journey undertaken this week by Helen Ryde, who “began a 600-mile pilgrimage from the North Carolina mountains to the America’s Center Convention Complex in St. Louis, site of the meeting. As she travels through Tennessee and Kentucky and Illinois, she planned to stop in dozens of United Methodist churches to say a prayer and pin an envelope containing her prayer to the door of each congregation.”

“Holy God,” her prayer read, “may every LGBTQ person who has ever been baptized, confirmed, attended or served this church know how fearfully and wonderfully made they are.”

A married lesbian, Ryde works as a regional organizer for the Reconciling Ministries Network, a group that encourages Methodists to embrace LGBT equality.

But the bigger issue is survival of the denomination itself. Dale Coulter sees an inevitable schism.

This is a war for the soul of the UMC. People on both sides feel strongly about their positions, and I don’t see how they can live together any longer. Progressive and traditionalist churches are pledging to leave if the outcome does not go the way they want. This includes significant churches like Mt. Horeb UMC in Lexington, South Carolina, the largest church in the state conference. The One Church Plan feels like a shotgun wedding when what is really needed is for both sides to walk away. The recent history of the TEC, ELCA, and the PCUSA on this same question suggests that the best way to avoid either a scorched-earth campaign or a slow death with a steady stream of churches departing is to agree to separate amicably.

I’M SORRY, I HAVE TO LAUGH…

“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself because he was unhappy about his salary and wanted to promote his career, Chicago’s police superintendent said Thursday. (NBC News Chicago)

Ever since this happened, there has been a hot and heavy firestorm about the supposed assault on Jussie Smollett in Chicago. Folks on the left immediately latched on to the idea that the actor was a victim of a hate crime motivated by racism and homophobia. Folks on the right immediately blamed the “left-wing media” of blowing the story all out of proportion and using it to further their radical agenda of identity politics.

And guess what? Now we find out that none of this was actually about racism, homophobia, or any political agenda. AT ALL!

This was an example of PURE CAPITALISM.

This was about an actor using his talent in a devious way to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes so that he could make a few more bucks and get a little more fame for himself. This was an all-American story of greed and self-aggrandizement. This was about a guy marketing himself, taking advantage of the spirit of the age, to climb the success ladder. We may be liberals, conservatives, or moderates, but together, in this great land, it’s all about buying and selling when it comes right down to it.

Come on, America. A hand for the entrepreneur!

It was a good old fashioned grift. And a lot of us fell for it.

Cue the timely P.T. Barnum quote.

OSCARS, ANYONE?

Tomorrow night is the Oscars. I can’t remember a year when I was less invested in the Motion Picture Academy Awards. In fact, the last time we even went to the movies was two Christmases ago. It seems I get less and less interested with each passing year. Not sure why, but part of it is probably just due to the season of life we’re in. Add to that the variety and content available on our TV screen at home, and I guess I’ve become a going-to-the-movies dropout.

He owes not only the city of Chicago an apology, but there are real, live victims out there today, and I refuse to shut up because he played a terrible game, and it’s painful.”

Not to be outdone, Maher got the final word on Smollett: “I saw Jussie’s interview with Robin Roberts,” the host said, “and he’s not a good actor.”

Earlier in the show, Maher raised the subject of Fox News with Rep. Adam Schiff by imploring the Democrat to go on Fox News to spread Schiff’s anti-Trump gospel of decency and integrity. (Watch that segment above).

Friday morning, Schiff had written an open letter to Republicans in Congress beseeching them to say in public what they say in private about Trump. “You‘ve bemoaned Trump’s lack of decency, character and integrity,” Schiff wrote in the Washington Post. “But you have chosen to keep your misgivings, your rising alarm, private. The time for silent disagreement is over. You must speak out.”

Maher seemed taken aback when Schiff mentioned on Real Time that Fox News’ Sean Hannity invites him on his show “a lot.”

“Please go,” Maher told the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. “You gotta get in [that] bubble, man.” Motioning toward the Real Time audience, Maher added, “This bubble is already sewn up.”

After some further Fox cajoling, Schiff gave in. “I will go,” he told Maher, “for you.”

With that accomplished, Maher eventually turned his attention to Amazon and its recent falling-out with New York City as a potential headquarters site. Maher, in his New Rules segment, implored Amazon to go where it could do some real good: a Red State that needs the jobs and some attention.

“Liberals,” he said, “have to start recolonizing” the angry, alienated red states. “There are no Real Housewives of Toledo or CSI: Lubbock.” His advice to Jeff Bezos: Stop playing affluent cities off of one another “and help a dying one come back to life.”

The Independent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia, is now the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility.

Johnson, a West Virginia native, was part of a group of women who crunched numbers at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton during the early days of the U.S. space program.

“I am thrilled we are honoring Katherine Johnson in this way as she is a true American icon who overcame incredible obstacles and inspired so many,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a release. “It’s a fitting tribute to name the facility that carries on her legacy of mission-critical computations in her honor.”

President Donald Trump signed into law in December an act of Congress calling for the redesignation.

The facility’s program contributes to the safety and success of NASA’s highest-profile missions by assuring that mission software performs correctly, NASA said. IV&V now is in the process of planning a rededication ceremony.

“It’s an honor the NASA IV&V Program’s primary facility now carries Katherine Johnson’s name,” NASA IV&V Program Director Gregory Blaney said in the release. “It’s a way for us to recognize Katherine’s career and contributions not just during Black History Month, but every day, every year.”

Johnson’s career spanned more than three decades with NASA and its predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

Among her professional accomplishments, Johnson calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard’s Freedom 7 mission in 1961. The following year, Johnson performed the work for which she would become best known when she was asked to verify the results made by electronic computers to calculate the orbit for John Glenn’s Friendship 7 mission.

She went on to provide calculations for NASA throughout her career, including for several Apollo missions.

At a time when racial segregation was prevalent throughout the South, Johnson and fellow African American mathematicians Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson -- who was later promoted to engineer -- broke through racial barriers and helped pave the way for the diversity, NASA said.

Their story became the basis of the 2017 film ""Hidden Figures,"" based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly.

Johnson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015 and, in 2017, NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, dedicated the new Katherine Jonson Computational Research Facility in her honor. Johnson celebrated her 100th birthday on Aug. 26."

According to the producers, the decision was made to “avoid further disruption on set,” revealed CNN.

The statement by the producers read, “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,” adding, “Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

The statement was signed by seven “Empire” producers, including Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, and showrunner Brett Mahoney.

According to the Chicago police, Smollett paid two men $3,500 to stage an attack on him last month because he was unhappy with his salary.

Smollett had told police that on January 29 he was attacked by two people who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck, and poured an unknown substance on him.

The incident prompted a flood of support for Smollett from all corners of Hollywood, including his “Empire” co-stars and producers.

However, according to police officials, they now have the cheque, which was made out to brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, who are now witnesses after confessing to the entirety of the plot while in custody.

The class 4 felony charge carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison and up to USD 25,000 in fines.

Smollett was released on USD 100,000 bond Thursday and ordered to give up his passport.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ‘’Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged. At this point, Smollett is part of the seven already completed episodes.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

There’s an old Russian proverb, “Trust but verify,” that was made popular by President Ronald Reagan between 1984-1987 as his administration worked toward nuclear disarmament with the Soviet Union, now known as Russia.

The story goes that he was advised that Russians liked to talk in proverbs, so it only made sense if he knew a few. “Trust but verify” became the one he gravitated to and used frequently. He knew, that despite his “good” relationship with his counterpart General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, he would need to not just take Gorbachev at his word but also verify that what was agreed upon happened and what was said was true.

Both my dad and grandfather pressed this principle into my DNA. My dad would encourage me to dig beyond headlines and soundbites as a kid growing up watching Walter Cronkite and find the facts. Not exactly easy to do — we didn’t have the internet back then (maybe that was a blessing), so I’d head to the library and read up on opposing views of Vietnam or the Watergate scandal or the Iran-Contra issues. My dad would say something like, “the truth and facts lies somewhere between those opposing views.”

My grandfather’s approach was similar, but not as kind. I remember an experience with my grandfather, sitting in his living room, sharing how my college professor suggested Beethoven was of black heritage, and my grandfather laughing, asking me if this was what I was paying for — to be misled. He then proceeded to pull out the encyclopedia and two other history books and march me over to the dining room table and had me “read up” on what was written about Beethoven. When I was done, he asked me if I thought the composer was still of black heritage – and I said according to what I read, probably not. His response, “Don’t always believe what you read or what you are told. Do your own research.”

To this day, I’m still uncertain as to Beethoven’s heritage based on my grandfather’s response. I walked away from that experience a bit more confused. Don’t believe what I read or what I’m told? If what is written is based on the writer’s perspective, and if what I’m told is based on the speaker’s perspective, where do I find the truth…or more importantly, the facts?

It takes work. And the truth…the facts…likely takes an art to discovering.

King Solomon, King of Israel, bluffed his way to discovering the truth in which woman was the true mother of the newborn baby by rendering a judgment that he would cut the baby in two and give each one half. It was clear to Solomon that the one who didn’t oppose the ruling wasn’t the true mother.

Maybe that old saying, “Just the facts, Ma’am,” attributed to Dragnet’s Sergeant Joe Friday (even though, according to some sources, he didn’t actually utter those exact words), isn’t so easy to come by.

It’s becoming more apparent today that trust but verify has lost ground to MY truth is the truth so don’t bother with the facts — because even if you can find the facts, it’s not what I believe — and what I believe is MY truth. And if it’s MY truth, it should be your truth. This serves only the individual.

Whether it be actor Jussie Smollett, who is now suspected of orchestrating a hoax but stands behind “his truth,” or President Trump, who has a habit of overlooking facts and creating his own truth, as a community and nation, we need to be better at verifying what we read and hear.

Just because someone says it, doesn’t mean it’s true (applies to our own local politicians). Take ownership over what you read and hear. Check what committees the person has chaired or participated in, verify how he/she voted on certain issues or initiatives, pull the minutes — is what they say in alignment with what they did? Trust…and verify. When you do, I do think you’ll find comfort in verifying what you read and hear — at least you’ll be able to own your position instead of being told what your position should be.

(Photo: Nuccio DiNuzzo / Getty Images, file)

Chicago – The story Jussie Smollett told police had it all: racism, homophobia, politics, celebrity – all tied up with a hangman’s noose. There was no question the news coverage was going to be massive.

In many ways, that coverage is an object lesson in the foibles of modern reporting. The story showed where news outlets teeter on the line between driving social media and being driven by it, between healthy skepticism and cautious credulity.

“We have the combination of social media and a polarized country converging here,” said Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Everyone is seeing events “from their political lens. No one is really good at distancing themselves.”

The story began as an account of a hate crime that went viral instantly.

A star of the hit Fox television show “Empire,” Smollett reported that he had been attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 on his way home from a sandwich shop. Smollett – who, like his character, is black and gay – said two masked men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured bleach on him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck.

He also claimed they shouted, “This is MAGA country” – a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

National media soon got wind of the story. Social media poured rocket fuel on it and set it ablaze.

Celebrities including “Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox and Oscar winner Viola Davis tweeted their love and support. Talk show host Andy Cohen, who is also gay, tweeted simply: “This. Is. Vile.”

Within hours, now Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker – both African-American – compared the attack to an “attempted modern-day lynching.” Even President Donald Trump seemed to take the story at face value.

But as police searched for surveillance footage of the attack, people began to wonder. Two men seen in a video went from being persons of interest to suspects, then to witnesses against Smollett.

It all came crashing down Thursday, when the 36-year-old actor turned himself in and was charged with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that alleges he made a false police report. Police claim Smollett staged the attack, enlisting two brothers who were his friends because he was unhappy with his salary.

After Smollett was charged, it seemed people who had been holding back suddenly felt free to admit they had doubts all along.

CNN anchor Don Lemon – who met Smollett during a guest appearance on “Empire” – said his initial reaction to the attack was not disbelief but “sadness.”

“I wasn’t shocked,” Lemon, a black man who came out as gay in 2011, told “Entertainment Tonight.” “I didn’t like that it happened to him.”

As police waited for Smollett to surrender, Lemon acknowledged Wednesday on CNN that many in the gay and African-American communities “had questions about this from the very beginning, the veracity of this story.”

It was minus 4 degrees that night.

“And let’s be honest,” Lemon said, “there are probably not a whole lot of MAGA fans watching ‘Empire.’”

But Smollett stuck to his story. And until a couple of weeks in, the media had nothing but a “gut” feeling to go on, said Tom Jones, senior media writer for the Florida-based Poynter Institute.

“I think most of the media handled it responsibly, saying, ‘Hey look. Here’s what the allegations are. Here’s what he’s saying. Here’s what he claimed happened. And then we’ll see where the investigation goes from here,’” Jones said.

“The word ‘alleged’ was all over any reference from the moment it was first reported,” Northwestern’s Whitaker added. “I didn’t hear a lot of really super-sympathetic coverage.”

Conservative columnist Ben Shapiro disagrees. He told Fox News that the volume of coverage on Smollett was “enormous” because “there’s a narrative to be promoted.”

“When a story is too perfect to be true, it usually is, and this is one of those cases,” he said.

Joe Saltzman said the Smollett story was a case of sheer “overkill,” even in this era of the 24-hour news cycle.

“This is not good journalism,” Saltzman, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, wrote in an email. “This is gossip and chatter.”

Robin Roberts, anchor of ABC’s “Good Morning America,” came in for some of the harshest criticism for a Feb. 14 exclusive interview with Smollett. Many accused her of failing to push him hard enough.

On Thursday’s show, Roberts called the situation a “setback for race relations,” adding that she “cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.”

Trump’s sympathy for Smollett also evaporated. “What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?” he tweeted Thursday, tagging the actor.

Earlier this week, as Smollett’s story began to unravel, his siblings took to Instagram.

“This is the media, an irresponsible media,” Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett posted, using a picture and slightly altered quotation from slain civil rights leader Malcolm X. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”

Smollett is free after posting $10,000 in bail, and his attorneys said he maintains his innocence. On Friday, he was cut from the final two episodes of this season of “Empire.”

During a news conference announcing the charges, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson surveyed the packed room of reporters.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said angrily.

On Thursday morning, he was formally charged with a felony for filing a false police report. Whether he will be sent to jail or get off with only probation is still yet to be decided. But what about the other two men who played a major role in the hoax? Smollett allegedly paid Abel and Ola Osundairo $3,200 to serve as his fake attackers in the scheme. After they were arrested as suspects for what police originally thought was a hate crime, they saved themselves by revealing Smollett’s real motives, according to The Washington Times.

The Osundairo brothers were caught on video surveillance in downtown Chicago the night the incident took place. They fit the description that Smollett gave to law enforcement of the men who attacked him. The actor even went on live television saying he had no doubt in his mind that those men were the individuals who had targeted him by yelling racist and homophobic slurs. He also claimed that they threw bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck.

Jussie Smollett Denies Allegations, Posts Bond https://t.co/P0EE3S7wLx pic.twitter.com/sFh3FGcr5g — The Source Magazine (@TheSource) February 23, 2019

It became clear that Smollett was going to let the brothers go to jail if it meant that his story looked more authentic. Thus, the brothers told police everything and were released from custody.

Chicago-based defense attorney Gal Pissetzky believes police are more focused on going after Smollett than the Osundairo brothers.

“I don’t think they are going to bother spending resources on charging them. They would rather get the big fish, Smollett.”

Whether or not the brothers are held accountable for the part they played in the hoax is dependent on several factors that have not yet been made clear. Police haven’t revealed whether or not the brothers knew how far Smollett was going to take the hoax before becoming involved. The actor’s motive for staging the entire thing was reportedly to get more publicity and be awarded a higher salary at Fox. If the Osundairo brothers were aware of this, they could be wrapped up in a charge of conspiracy.

If the brothers are charged in the case, it likely won’t be because of any injuries they caused Smollett. Smollett was almost entirely uninjured during the staged attack. Reports saying the actor suffered broken ribs as a result of the incident were later proven false. Photographs do show Smollett with small cuts on his face, however police now believe these could have been self-inflicted."

Kelly is now in the custody of the Chicago Police Department after turning himself in to officials to face 10 counts of sexual abuse.

Kelly arrived in a black Sprinter van Friday night outside the Chicago PD station as a huge crowd of media waited for his imminent arrival.

Wearing a blue jacket -- and no sunglasses -- Kelly made his way through the crowd and into the station. As we reported, he was indicted on 10 counts of felony sexual abuse, with 9 of those counts involving underage female victims ranging from ages 13 - 16.

The Blast first reported on the Cook County State's Attorney Office assembling a grand jury after lawyer Michael Avenatti delivered a tape allegedly featuring Kelly having sex with an underage girl.

Top prosecutor Kim Foxx gave a press conference today and revealed Kelly is facing a maximum 70 years in prison, with up to 7 years for each count of sexual abuse.

He's due in bond court Saturday afternoon, in the same court that ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett made an appearance earlier this week.

After he turned himself in, Kelly's attorney gave a press conference claiming one of the alleged victims is the same girl from Kelly's criminal case in the early 2000's. He claims the singer can't be successfully prosecuted because of the ""double jeopardy"" rule."

Most of the nation now knows that the Empire actor allegedly faked his own hate crime by hiring men to attack him. As law enforcement releases more threads from Smollett’s past texting conversations, the actor is looking worse than ever.

It’s clear that he allegedly put time and thought into staging his attack, wanting to make sure every detail was planned just right. On January 25, he sent Abel Osundairo a text requesting his help and asking to meet up face-to-face to discuss plans, according to Jezebel.

Smollett was able to persuade Osundairo to get on board with his plan by promising him a heap of cash. When he wasn’t sure if one fake attacker would be convincing enough, he decided to bring another man into the scheme. He sent Osundairo a text saying, “Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?”

Following that message, Osundairo and Smollett met up in person and decided to bring Osundairo’s older brother, Ola, on board. He then gave them $100 to purchase the supplies necessary to disguise themselves for the staged attack. The brothers then went to a local store where they bought ski masks and red hats similar to the infamous “Make America Great Again” hats. Video surveillance footage shows the men purchasing these items on the morning of the day the hoax was to take place. Smollett also gave the brothers a $3,500 check, with the word “training” written on the memo line. He reportedly instructed the brothers to rough him up, but to not hurt him too badly.

Many are wondering how a man who has a career as an actor could have made so many obvious mistakes in covering his tracks. Smollett not only failed to turn over his phone to police, but he waited before calling them. When they entered his apartment building, he even asked them to turn their body cameras off. The Chicago Police Department were suspicious of the attack from the beginning, with many details simply not adding up. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was admittedly furious about the wild goose chase Smollett allegedly led them all on, according to NBC News."

Smollett isn't just borderline color blind, either.

The star, who was paid $65,000 per episode for his part in the show, thought this wasn't enough, however, and used some of it to pay two black men - who he thought were white men - to 'beat him up', in order to publicize himself, and attract public sympathy.

This plan went badly wrong when the real color of the men was discovered.

Smollett now receives $0 per episode.

Color blindness is a condition that is present in about 8% of the US male population, but is usually found where there is a problem discerning red and green, but this is the first known case of someone being unable to distinguish between black and white.

His color-blindness isn't the only disability he from which he suffers

He also doesn't know which day of the week it is, when he's onto a good thing, which way to turn, and, in a test, didn't know his arse from his elbow.

Smollett's attorney says the forlorn 'star' is now due to audition for a major part in 'The All-New Muppet Movie'."

Smollett's attorney announced:

""My client has been the victim of yet another racist atrocity, which happened whilst he was in the supposed-comfort of his own home.

The university employee, Yuvi Panda, cheered the alleged assault – which campus police said happened on Tuesday -- on Twitter on Wednesday night.

He tweeted: “OH MY GOD THE MAGA PEOPLE ON UC BERKELEY CAMPUS YESTERDAY GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY SOMEONE THIS MAKES ME FEEL EMOTIONALLY SO MUCH BETTER.”

In a news release Friday night, UC Berkeley officials announced that police had identified a potential suspect ""Based on current information available to the department,"" the statement read, ""the suspect is not a student at, or affiliate of, the university."" The person was not named in the news release, which urged anyone with information to share it and aid in efforts at apprehension.

The release also took pains to say that UC Berkeley did not condone such behavior. ""Let there be no mistake,"" it said, ""we strongly condemn violence and harassment of any sort, for any reason. That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here. Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.”

The statement did not make reference to Panda, who had thanked the attacker for punching conservative activist Hayden Williams and “not letting it go unchallenged.”

“Hope you aren’t in too much trouble,” he added, before adding an expletive addressed to Turning Point USA, the organization that had been recruiting at the time.

CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST ASSAULTED AT UC-BERKELEY CAMPUS DURING RECRUITMENT DRIVE

In the incident, captured on cellphone video, two males walked up to the table containing information about Turning Point USA and engaged in an argument with Hayden Williams, who was sitting there.

As Williams began to film the incident with his cell phone, one of the men is seen punching him several times. It was also filmed by at least one witness.

The Turning Point table was also knocked over and their signs were ripped, according to accounts by people who were there.

Williams, who is not a student, is a field representative of the Leadership Institute, and in that role helps train and organize conservative students on college campuses across the country. He had been invited by Turning Point USA, which is in the midst of establishing a chapter at Berkeley, to man the table at the plaza on campus.

CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST TELLS 'HANNITY' ABOUT ALLEGED ASSAULT ON UC BERKELEY CAMPUS

In an interview Friday with Fox News, Williams said that the two men who approached him took issue with a sign at the table that said “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,"" in an apparent reference to the Jussie Smollett scandal, and accused the group of promoting violence.

He said that a student and his friend walked up to the table ""erratically and abruptly,"" cursing at him for the conservative signs and literature at the table. The signs included support for President Donald Trump and the one about bogus hate crime allegations.

Williams, 26, told Fox News on Friday that he’s been attacked before while helping recruit on college campuses, including two weeks ago at U.C.L.A., but never to the degree he was on Tuesday.

“We get all sorts of flack at Berkeley,” he said. “I’m an easy target for these people. I’m a small guy.”

Williams said Tuesday’s attack was “discomforting.”

“It does make me fear for my safety,” he said.

He lamented the glee many are expressing on social media over the violence on Tuesday.

""The person who assaulted me is being hailed as a hero by the campus community, many people are told not to snitch on him. That’s how hostile campuses are to conservatives. People think it’s totally justified to violently attack conservatives because they disagree with their views.""

Panda works at Berkeley’s Data Science Education Program as a DevOps Architect, according to the university’s website.

Campus Reform, a news site that is operated by the Leadership Institute, said that UC-Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof confirmed Panda's employment at the school.

“This person does not speak for the university, does not represent the university, and does not share the university’s values,” Mogulof told Campus Reform. “The University has made clear through word and deed that violence and harassment are reprehensible and intolerable, no matter who the perpetrators and victims are, or what they believe in.”

“We have sent a message to the entire campus community with a picture of the suspect and a strong request that those with information come forward to report what they know. We very much want to identify the suspects and bring those responsible to justice,” he added.

“While we have no legal ability to control or sanction what employees do during their free time, it should be absolutely clear that any expression of approval and support for violence stands in complete and total opposition to the values, commitments, and policies of this university,” said, adding that Panda ""does not speak for the university, does not represent the university, and does not share the university’s values.""

Williams, meanwhile, says he will not be intimidated into staying quiet about his conservative views.

He will continue being an advocate, he said, “because of dedication to our beliefs and values.”"

Of course, Surviving R. Kelly is probably the most relevant if you are looking to do the latter. Kelly was (finally) charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault today, including abuse of underage girls, and many reports credit this disturbing documentary (featuring many of his victims’ first-hand accounts) as the catalyst for the charges. The docu-series, which can be viewed via Lifetime on Demand now, is riveting and shocking, not only for its graphic accounts of the R&B singer’s brutal attacks and brainwashing but also for the way it shows how he got away with it for so long, thanks to enablers and a complicit public that allows rich, famous and powerful men to circumvent the law, maybe especially when the victims are women of color. There are many more #MeToo stories to be told in the music industry and the say of reckoning is coming (we’re looking at you, Ryan Adams) but this one helped kick-start it, so it’s a must-see.

Speaking of portrayal of abuse, Lorena, the story of '90s tabloid couple Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt, from the amazing Jordan Peele (Get Out), is a four-part docu-miniseries (streaming on Amazon Prime) recounting the infamous penis-cutting incident that Gen X-ers in particular will never forget. It was a sensationalistic story at the time that made many guys’ groins ache just thinking about it. But we'd be lying if we said that many women almost understood Lor’s frustration. John was a garbage human being, an abusive serial cheater who should have been exposed as such rather than portrayed as an unwitting victim or brunt of bad late-night talk show jokes. His wife was wrong, of course, but it was hard to see John “Wayne” (telling name) as victim when soon after penis enlargement surgery, he became a porn star, and a bad one at that.

If you haven’t lost complete faith in humanity after watching the two shows above, you will after seeing Abducted in Plain Sight on Netflix. The true-crime chronicle tells the story of the Broberg family and their creepy pedo neighbor Robert Berchtold. Berchtold lusted after the family’s oldest daughter, 12-year-old Jan, whom he abducted twice. But he didn’t stop there, not by a long shot. There’s lots more shocks and twists to this one; we won’t spoil it for those who still haven’t seen it but suffice to say it is a heart-breaking and WTF-inducing watch. We actually don’t advise screening all three of these in one weekend unless you’re a fan of real-life torture porn, and if you are, get help. Everyone featured in the terrifyng trifecta above sure needs it.

It’d be nice if we could all escape the harsh realities of the world while watching the Oscars, but it will probably take years to wash the stench of Harvey Weinstein's omnipotent presence off the show for those who've watched every year. And this year’s slate of nominees isn’t really about escapism, anyway. With nominated performances dealing with mental illness, HIV and the struggles of life as a domestic worker, to name a few, it was far from a frivolous year thematically. The historic nominations of Roma and Black Panther (both on Netflix, by the way) make it an important year, too. Sadly, the recent Jussie Smollett charges probably will be a big topic on the red carpet beforehand, but the power of the films and their stars dressed in their finest are sure to outshine everything else as they usually do, even without a host to hold it together. The show airs live on Sunday at 5 p.m. And warning: Don't go anywhere near Hollywood on Sunday unless you really, really like crowds."

Robert Sylvester Kelly, 52, surrendered on Friday night at the 1st District Chicago police station, hours after the Cook County State's Attorney office issued a no bail warrant for his arrest.

Kelly arrived at the station in a large black van with tinted windows at around 8pm CT. He exited the vehicle wearing a puffy blue coat, entered the station house, was handcuffed and led away.

The R&B singer did not respond as reporters shouted questions, including 'Are you innocent?' and 'How do you explain the video?'

In response to a question about what he had to say 'to the black women of Chicago,' Kelly's attorney shot back: 'That's an offensive question.'

Following Kelly's arrest, his attorney Steve Greenberg addressed reporters outside the station.

He said that several of the charges are 'double jeopardy' because they 'involve the same girl' that Kelly was acquitted of producing child pornography with in 2008.

Greenberg went on to say that all of the accusations against Kelly, including those in the recent documentary Surviving R Kelly, are false.

'I think all the women are lying, yes. This has become, 'Hey I can say R. Kelly did something.' Boom,' the lawyer said. ''Oh I met R Kelly once, he looked at me the wrong way.' Boom, money.'

Greenberg also blasted celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti, who said last week that he had turned over to prosecutors damning video evidence of Kelly performing sex acts on a 14-year-old girl.

'I haven't seen Avenatti's tape,' Greenberg said. 'I wonder why [prosecutor] Kim Foxx isn't investigating him for disseminating child porn and watching child porn, which I'm sure he's done many times.'

Avenatti blasted back minutes later on Twitter: 'Steve Greenberg is exactly what R Kelly deserves. Happy to be living rent free in this guy's head.'

Singer R Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg denied the charges against his client, telling reporters that 'all the women are lying'

Upon news of his arrest, some of Kelly's accusers spoke out to express their gratitude.

'When I first heard the news, I started crying because it was tears of joy,' Asante McGee told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

She appeared in the Surviving R Kelly docuseries, in which she accused the singer of holding her in a Georgia home and abusing her six years ago - allegations that are unrelated to the criminal charges Kelly faces in Chicago.

'To know that we finally got an indictment after two decades, after him getting away with the allegations, it was a joyous moment for me,' McGee said. 'Just knowing the things that he was doing to those young girls was really sickening.'

Kelly will appear in bond court on Saturday and then be formally arraigned on March 8, according to court records.

Records obtained by DailyMail.com reveal that most of the counts Kelly was charged with on Friday involved girls who were between the ages of 13 and 16 at the time.

The fourth, who claims that she was assaulted by Kelly in 2003, was over the age of 18 at the time of the alleged offense.

In a statement, Kelly's attorney said the singer is 'shell-shocked' by the sex abuse charges.

Kelly has previously denied all allegations of assault and abuse through his lawyer.

Aggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony with a sentencing range of 3-7 years in prison. He faces up to 70 years behind bars if convicted.

These new charges come one week after the emergence of a rape tape that allegedly features Kelly and a minor.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx spoke about the charges at a brief press conference on Friday.

She went through the charges related to each of the four victims, using only initials to identify the women.

Got him: The incidents allegedly took place between 1998 and 2010, and is unclear if the grand jury is done hearing testimony and evidence in the case (Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx at a press conference on Friday)

Back to court: R Kelly (above at his 2008 trial) has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse by the Cook County State's Attorney's office

First was H.W., who was under the age of 17 between the dates of May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999.

Kelly is charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for the alleged offenses involving that victim.

Those include an instance of 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and H.W's sex organ,' an instance where the contact was with 'H.W's mouth' and when 'Robert Kelly touched his penis to H.W's breast.'

The fourth count stems from the claim that 'Robert Kelly touched his mouth to H.W's breast.'

R.L. was involved in an incident which occurred between September 26, 1998 and September 25, 2001 when she was a minor.

That alleged incident resulted in two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse - one for 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and R.L's sex organ' one for contact with her 'mouth.'

The third victim L.C. was of the age of consent on February 18, 2003.

'A grand jury returned an indictment of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse based on the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly upon any part of the body of the victim for the purpose of sexual gratification during the course of the underlying forcible felony of Attempt Criminal Sexual Assault,' said Foxx.

The fourth and final victim was identified as J.P., and the incidents she was involved in led to the final three sexual abuse charges against Kelly.

Those incidents took place between May 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, and the victim was under the age of 17.

In that case there was 'contact between Robert Kelly's penis and J.P's sex organ,' 'moth' and 'the transmission of semen by Robert Kelly.'

Foxx had made a very public plea for accusers to come forward last month, and there could be more charges to come.

This comes just one day after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office announced that Jussie Smollett had been indicted by a grand jury on a single charge of disorderly conduct for falsifying a police report in a suspected hate hoax.

Illinois is just one of the states where there is an open investigation into Kelly.

Lawyers for the Southern District of New York have also been meeting with alleged victims as well as agents from the IRS and FBI while the Department of Homeland Security has also opened up a probe.

The alleged rape tape was submitted to the State's Attorney's Office last week by Michael Avenatti.

At the time, Avenatti said that he believed it showed Kelly and an underage minor whose age he guessed to be 14.

CNN then watched the tape as well, despite the fact that it is a federal crime to watch child pornography.

When asked if either party might be investigated for these actions, an FBI spokesperson declined to comment.

R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving several victims including minors. He is seen above performing in 2016

This all comes in the wake of the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly.

The six-part docuseries ended on a devastating note, with the parents of one of the young women who had run away with Kelly seen throwing rocks at his studio windows trying to get the attention of their daughter.

When they called Chicago police however, the members of law enforcement were not able to legally enter the property.

Kelly had yet to be hit with any criminal charges in the wake of the docuseries until Friday.

His manager however found himself in trouble with the law days after the series premired.

A police report filed in Georgia reveals that Don Russell texted and called Timothy Savage, the father of one of the alleged victims, to say it 'would be best for him and his family if the documentary does not air.'

Russell later said that he and Kelly might have to release information that would destroy Savage, his family and his business.

Savage and his wife Jonelyn have been trying for years to get back their daughter Jocelyn, who ran off to be with Kelly shortly after meeting him backstage at a concert when she was only 17.

They believe that she is being held captive but the singer, but both Kelly and Jocelyn deny this is the case.

The report states that Savage called police shortly after 5am on the day of the incident.

The responding officer then arrived at the house before 5.45am, which is when Russell called Savage on the phone.

Savage was then able to put the phone on speaker so that the officer could hear everything that was being said by Russell.

'Don says several times that Timothy is providing Lifetime with false information, and that is he continues supporting the documentary that they (R Kelly / Don) would be forced to release information disproving Don,' reads the report.

'Don advised Timothy that the information would ruin him, his reputation, business and family, because it would show him a liar.'

This is actually the second time one of the singer's managers has threatened Savage, who previously filed a police report against James Mason.

There is now an outstanding warrant for Mason after he failed to respond to police when they asked to question him about the 'threats' he made to Savage.

The Savages first spoke out in an interview with BuzzFeed on in 2017 which contained worrying allegations that Kelly had been holding a handful of young women in cult like conditions and effectively treating them as his sexual slaves for years.

Some former members of his entourage vouched for their concern. Three separate women said they were all forced to subscribe to his rules.

They said they were told when to eat, bathe, sleep and had to perform sexual acts on one another which the singer then recorded.

Savage's mother recalled painstakingly how she was present when her daughter met the singer as an aspiring musician herself after being invited backstage to a concert in 2015.

It's not clear exactly when Jocelyn went to live with Kelly but her family say they have not seen her since December 2017. 'It was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner — it was horrible,' her mother said.

The mother-of-three boasted about meeting the star again in January 2016. On Facebook, she posed with Jocelyn and the star along with one other women, telling friends how they were 'in the studio'.

In her BuzzFeed interview, she said she thought it would be 'fine' for her daughter to spend time with the star if she was there to watch over her.

Jocelyn's father Timothy believes she is suffering Stockholm Syndrome, a condition which sees hostages grow to love their captors.

The family contacted police after their daughter fled to live with the singer and told officers how he was running a 'cult'.

Police visited the home where they said she was but it was empty. They then tracked her down in Chicago but she said she was fine and wanted to be left alone by her family.

Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee - all former members of Kelly's entourage - described in detail the sort of treatment endured by young women who find themselves pulled into the singer's orbit.

A representative for Kelly spoke out at the time about the claims, saying the singer 'unequivocally denies' them and said he will 'work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and to clear his name'.

Earlier, Mack, Jones, and McGee said there are at least six women living in properties rented by the R&B star in Chicago and Atlanta. The 'guest houses' where the women are kept are near his home in suburban Atlanta, and his apartment at Trump Tower in Chicago.

'You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom… [Kelly] is a master at mind control... He is a puppet master,' Mack, who worked as the singer's assistant, told the website.

The women, who said the 'babies' - as the girls are referred to - are required to call Kelly 'Daddy', then ran through a list of people they believe were living either at one of the performer's properties in Atlanta or his Chicago recording studio last summer.

The first woman mentioned in the article was a 31-year-old 'den mother', who is reportedly responsible for 'training newcomers on how Kelly liked to be pleasured sexually'.

The 'den mother' 'had been best friends since high school' with the person who was allegedly in the videotape that led to Kelly standing trial on child pornography charges in 2008.

Mack said many of the young women are sucked in by the singer because they think: 'This is R. Kelly, I'm going to live a lavish lifestyle'.

In addition to the aforementioned control Kelly has, he allegedly demands the women ask his permission before leaving a room, are forced to wear jogging suits in public in order to keep their figures hidden, have their phones taken and are given new ones that are only allowed to be used to contact him or others approved by him, and have to deal with a 'burly' SUV driver parked outside his properties.

Both Mack and Jones said that if any of the women break the 'rules', Kelly 'punishes them physically and verbally'. Jones recounted a time she angered Kelly by 'being too friendly' with the male cashier.

'I got trapped. I had people telling me I was an idiot. But it took me a long time to realize they were right, and I'm talking now because I hope I can help some of these other girls,' said Jones.

McGee added: 'R. Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet. But Robert is the devil.'"

The 'Empire' actor had claimed he was the victim of a shocking assault in Chicago last month but doubt was cast over the situation when it emerged he knew two men investigated over the alleged attack, brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo, and now a Cook County Grand Jury have charged him with a felony offence that could see him spend up to three years behind bars if found guilty

23 February 2019

However, lawyers acting for the 36-year-old star have vowed to ""mount an aggressive defence"" against the charge.



Attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.



""Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount and aggressive defense.""



According to TMZ, the two brothers who had been investigated told the jury they had been paid to stage the attack at Jussie's behest.



They were caught on camera buying supplies including ski masks, gloves, bandanas, sunglasses and red hats, and are said to have told police they spent days driving with Jussie to find a location for the incident to take place and even rehearsed their attack.



The actor will appear in court on Thursday (21.02.19).



The star's lawyers recently claimed he was ""angered and devastated"" by suggestions he had staged the attack.



They said: ""As a victim of a hate crime who has co-operated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.



""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.



""One of these purported suspects was Jussie's personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video.



""It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity.""

Smollett plays Jamal Lyon in the show, which is wrapping up its fifth season. In it, he’s the son of music mogul Lucious Lyon, portrayed by Terrance Howard.

“To avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season,” the show’s executive producers said Friday in a statement to UPI. “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us.

“Jussie has been an important member of our ‘Empire’ family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

Smollett appeared at the Chicago set of the show Thursday and apologized to cast members, while insisting he didn’t fake an assault for which he is facing the felony charges. There, he filmed at least one scene.

Fox had previously said it was “considering options” about how to handle the actor’s status on the show.

The charges stem from a Jan. 29 report in which Smollett, 36, said two attackers poured bleach on him and made racial and homophobic slurs. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said investigators believe he staged the attack because he was unhappy with his pay on “Empire.”

Smollett recently received a salary raise to $125,000 per episode in a deal that also allowed him to make extra money off the show’s music.

Smollett posted a $100,000 bond after being charged with felony disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. After his release, Smollett’s legal team said he feels “betrayed” by the legal system.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” said a statement from Smollett’s lawyers Thursday. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

Throughout this entire ordeal, Smollett has maintained that he was innocent in the entire saga, and that he was nothing more than a victim of a homophobic and racially motivated attack. Now Page Six is reporting that Smollett told law enforcement after he was taken into custody on Thursday that he has an untreated drug problem.

This latest claim is only serving to confuse the issue more, because after he was released on a $100,000 bond, he visited the set of Empire to apologize for the situation, while still insisting he had nothing to do with the attack. The claim has some wondering whether Smollett is already setting up his defense to argue that he cannot be held accountable for any part he may have taken in staging the attack.

According to prosecutors familiar with the case, text messages discovered on the actor’s phone indicate that one of the brothers who Smollett accused of attacking him, Abimbola Osundairo, is actually his drug dealer. They believe that Abimbola has been selling Smollett “designer drugs” since April of 2018.

Jussie Smollett claims he has an untreated drug problem https://t.co/phezzFH3u1 pic.twitter.com/MdnPYx1uzK — The Sun (@TheSun) February 22, 2019

Despite having allegedly told police he has an untreated drug problem, Smollett answered “no” on legal forms that asked whether he had any alcohol or mental health issues.

Shortly after the January 29 attack, Smollett filed a report claiming he had been attacked near his Chicago home by two men who were shouting racial and homophobic slurs at him in between yelling “MAGA country.” He also reported that they tied him with a rope and poured what is believed to be bleach on him.

Authorities believe that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 to attack him.

He has now been charged with filing a false report, and could face up to three years in prison if he’s found guilty on the charges. Smollett has also been removed from Empire in upcoming episodes of the show, and there is talk that he could be replaced.

The attack came after a threatening letter was addressed to Smollett on the set of Empire, which is also speculated to have been sent by Smollett to himself to draw attention. After the letter failed to hit the news the way he wanted, he decided instead to stage the attack on himself with the help of the Osundairo brothers."

A Houston sixth-grader was kidnapped and robbed by a band of young white supremacists, one with an “I hate black people” tattoo on his arm. And on one of the coldest nights of the year in Chicago, Jussie Smollett, a black and gay actor, was attacked by two men who shouted “MAGA Country” and slipped a noose around his neck.

The three victims reported these horrific assaults to the police as hate crimes, all built on America’s race, religion and sexual identity fault lines. Except the police say the incidents never happened.

Smollett’s dramatic tale of a hate-fueled assault by Trump supporters last month was pure fiction, according to the Chicago police, a calculated stunt to generate publicity and a higher salary for his role on the show “Empire.” On Thursday, the actor was arrested on a felony charge of having filed a false police report.

Despite the headlines that have dominated the news cycle since, fake hate crime reports are uncommon.

Hoaxes are not tracked formally, but the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said that of an estimated 21,000 hate crime cases between 2016 and 2018, fewer than 50 reports were found to be false. The center believes that less than 1 percent of all reported hate crimes are false.

But such false reports can play an outsize role in undermining the credibility of real bias victims and anti-hate efforts. In the aftermath of Smollett’s arrest, one lawmaker has even promised to draft a bill increasing the penalty for filing false hate crime reports.

“Devastating is how I would describe this Smollett story, especially during this legislative season when some states are trying to pass hate crime reform bills,” said Brian Levin, a national hate crime expert and the California center’s director. “This has the potential to eclipse the real facts about hate crimes.”

In the six weeks after Donald Trump’s election, hate crime reports spiked to their highest number in more than a decade, according to the center. Levin, whose research draws from news media reports, counted nine false hate crime claims in this period, most detailing pro-Trump signs and symbolism.

Among those cases was the one in 2016 reported by Yasmin Seweid, 18, the young woman on the New York City subway who told police that she was the victim of an anti-Islamic assault. She said the attackers yelled “Donald Trump.” But within weeks, Seweid admitted that she had made up the story, reportedly to cover for a night of drinking with friends. She was charged with filing a false report, a misdemeanor in New York state.

As with the Smollett case, the sensational elements of the story — a young Muslim woman cornered, harassed and followed — became fodder for the news media.

“These kinds of rare cases do damage, especially in the current hostile political environment,” said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “They are seized upon and used to try to discredit legitimate anti-Muslim incidents or used to say there is no such thing as a hate crime.”

Hooper said his group received 2,000 to 3,000 bias reports annually before verification, and “less than a handful” were deemed false each year.

Cynthia Deitle spent more than 20 years as an FBI special agent in the civil rights unit, focused on hate crimes and police brutality. As the director of programs and operations at the Matthew Shepard Foundation, she said the most common motivation behind the false hate crime reports that she had investigated was the desire for attention and sympathy.

“They felt that being labeled a ‘hate crime victim’ would be a positive result,” Deitle said. “The cases I examined took place in a workplace environment and at residences, and sometimes the allegation was made to draw attention away from a real negative aspect of the complainant’s life, like poor performance at work or school, or a feeling that the complainant was not getting the attention she or he deserved.”

In Smollett’s telling of the Chicago attack, he was leaving a Subway restaurant in the Streeterville neighborhood when two masked men attacked him around 2 a.m. He said they called him homophobic and racial slurs and slung a rope around his neck. Even by hate crime standards, the story of an assault on a celebrity seemed shocking and garnered relentless attention.

But it wasn’t long before the story collapsed. Questions, inconsistencies and a lack of evidence chipped away at Smollett’s version of events. He steadfastly push backed at doubters, even appearing on “Good Morning America,” where he passionately proclaimed his innocence and questioned why anyone would make up a hate crime. “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this,” Smollett told Robin Roberts.

According to some experts, the motivation behind filing false hate crime reports may be more than just getting attention.

“As a community we have to say this is unacceptable, because it’s wrong and dangerous and puts others at risk,” said Kelly Champion, a clinical and forensic psychologist specializing in trauma and anxiety. And, she added, Smollett “may have been under so much stress that we don’t know about that this seemed like an effective solution” to his problems.

By the end of the week, police had built their own narrative. They announced that Smollett had staged the assault, hiring two brothers for $3,500. They said he was also responsible for sending himself a threatening letter. Both acts were done to promote his career, they contend. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

Smollett’s legal team has denied the claims made by police. “He wants nothing more than to clear his name,” said Jack Prior, one of his lawyers.

In the wake of the Smollett case, state Rep. Nick Zerwas, a Minnesota Republican, said he planned to introduce legislation this session increasing the penalty for falsely reporting a hate crime. The announcement was met with pushback from Democrats.

“I don’t think we need to create a chilling effect on people reporting hate crimes,” Minnesota state Rep. Ryan Winkler, the majority leader, told the Star Tribune in Minneapolis. If anything, he said, hate crimes were underreported."

In that interview, published on the 15th of February 2019, Jussie detailed the night of his attack. He said the attack happened at about 2am as he was leaving a Subway Restaurant in Chicago. According to him, the two attackers got his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, and they put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance, likely bleach, on him.

When asked why he hesitated to call the police. He responded by saying, “there's a level of pride there. We live in a society where, as a gay man you're considered to be somehow weak. And I'm not weak; we [the gay community] are not weak. I'm glad that Frank reported it.” This was at the center of all he said throughout the interview: his pride, how society considers gay people and his empowerment of gay men. What he didn't, however, add was that any of it be done by violence.

ABC News’ Robin Roberts asked him what he would say to a young gay man and this was his answer: “learn to fight; learn to be a fighter. I'm not advocating violence…”

The two attackers, in a new twist to the case, have alleged that Jussie Smollett paid them to orchestrate and stage the attack on him. According to them, Smollett was upset that the threatening letter sent to Empire studios didn't receive enough attention. Jussie’s attorney in response to this new twist said: ‘Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he's familiar with. He [Jussie Smollett] has now been victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth, and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.’ The threatening letter is now gaining serious attention as journalists are asking whether he sent them himself.

Today on ABC News, the police released a formal statement calling Jussie Smollett’s attack fake. He's been charged a felony, for filing a fake report."

The brothers, identified by Schmidt as Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, are of Nigerian descent. But they told a reporter at CBS2-Chicago that they were “born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens.”

They are bodybuilders who have developed an online following and have dabbled in acting and at least one failed business venture, according to social media posts and news reports.

Abimbola Osundairo, 25, graduated from Lake View High School in Chicago, where he participated in football, track and field, soccer, and wrestling, before joining the football team at Quincy University in western Illinois, according to a football profile on the university’s website. Olabinjo Osundairo, 27, also was on the Quincy football team and had attended Latmos Comprehensive College in Lagos, Nigeria, according to his football profile.

Smollett, who is black and gay, he was physically attacked by two men who shouted homophobic and racial slurs at him before beating him up and throwing some kind of chemical on him the early morning of Jan. 29. He also said his attackers shouted, “This is MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and looped a rope around his neck.

The brothers told a CBS2 reporter in a phone interview that they are not racist, homophobic or anti-Trump, the news station reported.

Chicago police said they reviewed video of Smollett walking downtown but found nothing showing an attack. They released images of two people , later identified as the brothers, whom they called “persons of interest” in the case because they were in the area at the time.

The Osundairos were arrested on Feb. 13 at O’Hare International Airport after returning from Nigeria when police learned at least one of them worked on “Empire.” Police said they left for Nigeria on the day of the attack. Police released them released after two days, saying the “investigation had shifted” following interviews with the brothers.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a news conference Thursday that investigators reviewed extensive phone records between Smollett and the brothers, including calls from when the brothers were in Nigeria after the allegedly staged attack.

The Cook County State’s Attorney charged the 36-year-old Smollett on Wednesday with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He turned himself in to police early Thursday to face the charge, police said.

Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, met with prosecutors and police earlier Wednesday afternoon. It’s unknown what was discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.

A man identified on some videos as the Osundairos’ business partner, Leland Stanford, did not respond Wednesday to a Facebook message. The Osundairos did not respond to a message on their “Team Abel” Facebook page or to an email posted on their YouTube page, and a voice message left at a phone number listed for their father also was not returned.

Smollett’s lawyers had said the actor was angered and “victimized” by reports that he may have played a role in staging the attack.

“As a victim of a hate crime who has co-operated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,” the weekend statement read. “He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.”

The statement said one of the brothers was Smollett’s personal trainer, and the Chicago Tribune — which is not naming the brothers — reported that Smollett follows their bodybuilding page on Instagram.

The Osundairos, who promote a fitness and diet program under the title “Team Abel,” have more than 20,000 Instagram followers and more than 1,600 followers on Facebook. They also have a “Team Abel” YouTube channel.

They’re also aspiring actors who have posted auditions online and reportedly worked with Smollett on “Empire.”

The Tribune reported that neither brother has been credited for work on “Empire,” though the older brother said in a 2015 interview that he played the prison bodyguard for Chris Rock’s character. Rock guest-starred on the Season 2 premiere of “Empire” in 2015.

The newspaper also reported that the brothers signed in 2016 with Hinsdale, Illinois-based Babes ‘N Beaus Model and Talent Agency, according to one of the owners, Don Underwood.

Each appeared on an episode of NBC’s “Chicago P.D.” last year, and both had roles in the 2017 independent movie “The Worst Nightmare,” the Tribune reported. One had a small part in Spike Lee’s 2015 film, “Chi-Raq.”

State records showed the Osundairos established a party and decoration store in 2015 that was dissolved last year, the Tribune reported. Federal court records show they filed for bankruptcy in 2016 with tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt and their store “operating at a loss.”

The newspaper reported that the older brother pleaded guilty in 2012 to aggravated battery and was sentenced to two years of probation for a stabbing that occurred a year earlier about a block away from the brothers’ home, according to Cook County records. His brother was ticketed for a DUI in 2015.

Members of Congress tweeted messages of support; CNN’s Don Lemon texted him every evening to see how he was doing. People on the left, it was clear, wanted to believe that Jussie, who is both gay and black, had, as he claimed, been set upon at around two A.M., in subzero weather, on a Chicago street by a pair of white thugs wearing MAGA hats and spouting anti-gay and anti-black insults.

Never mind that the whole tale seemed fishy from the start. The assailants had supposedly been wearing MAGA hats and hoodies. How does that work? Apparently they’d not only recognized Jussie from a show most of us have never heard of (Empire, on NBC) but also knew he was gay. They’d said he was in “MAGA country.” (Since when is Chicago MAGA country?) They’d put a noose around his neck and poured some liquid on him that Jussie first identified as bleach and that the cops later said was gasoline. (So they’d been wandering around the Windy City on an ice-cold night with a noose and a container of caustic liquid on the off chance that they’d run into a black TV actor?) Perversely, when the cops showed up at Jussie’s home to take down his report, he still hadn’t removed the noose from around his neck.

Yet some folks were so fiercely supportive of Jussie that they slammed journalists for (quite properly) using the word “alleged” to describe the attack. At Out Magazine, a writer named Tre’vell Anderson instructed readers that it was wrong to harbor any doubt about Jussie’s claims: “Somehow, I thought, or at least hoped, society at large was at the point of believing victims, what with the enduring impact of the #MeToo movement.” That some observers were still uncertain proved to Anderson “that we as a country are still in denial” about the fact “that Donald Trump’s presidency has thrown a rock at the beehive of white cis hetero patriarchy and supremacy hanging over our heads.” Not a terribly felicitous metaphor, but you get the gist.

Even after it began to be painfully clear that the whole thing was a scam, many of Jussie’s hangers-on hung on. As recently as last Wednesday, the day before the Chicago Police finally arrested him, actress Gabourey (Precious) Sidibe insisted she still stood by him, whatever that can mean under such circumstances. Don Lemon, instead of exhibiting even a scintilla of contrition for the speed with which he’d lapped up Jussie’s lies, reacted to the collapse of the scam by complaining that Sean Hannity and others on the right would exploit it to the hilt.

The bottom line about Jussie (who, cops say, conceived of the hoax as a way to get a raise) is that he should be thrilled to have what he has. He’s a very lucky guy. But in these twisted times, in places like Hollywood, it’s better to be a victim than to be a success. No, that’s not quite it: the thing nowadays, in such milieux, is that it’s good to be a success, but if you’re going to be a success, you’d better also be a victim, owing to your group identity or identities, and had better embrace that victimhood with all you’ve got. That’s what Jussie was doing with his scripted assault: claiming his factitious victimhood. Sending out the message that, in Trump’s America, even somebody with a network TV series can still be legitimately considered oppressed because of the minority groups he belongs to.

Jussie might have used his success in the opposite way: to show young black and gay kids that their group identities need not be barriers to achievement. That America, in the year 2019, is bigger and better than that. That playing the victim is a loser move that leads nowhere good. But that’s the old-fashioned approach. In the age of Trump, when the PC armies demand that you buy into the proposition that the orange-haired billionaire’s presence in the White House has unleashed a nationwide tsunami of violence against women, blacks, gays, transsexuals, disabled people, etc., etc., you’d better go along with that party line or else.

What’s supremely ironic here is that even as Jussie Smollett was selfishly exploiting – and encouraging – the corrosive notion that Trump’s America is a society awash in homophobia and racism, the Trump administration itself was preparing a concerted effort to fight anti-gay prejudice in those places around the world where it really exists on a lethal level. In 72 countries, being gay is illegal; in eight, it’s a capital offense.

In the aftermath of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the U.S. and other Western nations, this is what gay-rights professionals should be concerning themselves with: namely, helping gays abroad to achieve at least some measure of the rights they themselves enjoy in the West. Instead, most of them are preoccupied with transsexuality – specifically, with advancing such dubious causes as the right of unstable parents to give their “gender-nonconforming” kids puberty blockers and with demonizing decent people (such as Martina Navratilova) who challenge the right of men who say they’re women to compete as female athletes, use women’s bathrooms, and so on.

It’s bad enough that people who work in the gay-activism racket or for gay “community” institutions show so little interest in working for the rights of gays in non-Western countries. Even worse is that when word came out that the Trump administration was taking on that job, some of these people reacted with outrage. At Out Magazine, Mathew Rodriguez (who’d covered Jussie’s saga with total sympathy and not a hint of doubt) waxed cynical: although Trump’s “global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality in dozens of nations where anti-gay laws are still on the books…looks like an atypically benevolent decision by the Trump administration,” wrote Rodriguez, “the details of the campaign belie [sic] a different story. Rather than actually being about helping queer people around the world, the campaign looks more like another instance of the right using queer people as a pawn to amass power and enact its own agenda.” In the U.S., of course, it’s the left – the Democrats – that has consistently used gays as pawns over the past decades; offhand, I can’t recall a major instance in which the right has done so. I also know that Trump publicly supported same-sex marriage long before any of the Obamas or Bushes or Clintons did. But let’s set all that aside for now.

Rodriguez went on to note that the new Trump pro-gay plan “centers [on] homophobic violence in Iran” and “has reportedly been spearheaded by the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who is also the administration’s top-ranked gay official, in response to news that a young gay man was hanged in Iran recently.” How to make this sound nefarious? Well, first Rodriguez referred to “Grenell’s sudden interest in Iran’s anti-gay laws.” What does Rodriguez know about Grenell that justifies his use of the word “sudden”? Rodriguez also compared Grenell’s supposedly cynical concern about gays in Iran to Trump’s response to the 2016 Pulse massacre in Orlando: “Trump used the 49 deaths as a way to galvanize support for an anti-Muslim agenda rather than find a way to support LGBTQ+ people.”

As it happens, the Pulse massacre was an act of jihad, pure and simple, and Trump’s response was therefore entirely appropriate. But such facts are too politically incorrect for Out Magazine. No, here’s Rodriguez’s angle: just as Trump used Orlando to bash Islam, Grenell is using Iran’s anti-gay laws to bash, well, Iran. Rodriguez even quoted postcolonialist academic hack Gayatri Spivak’s famous statement that Westerners who profess to care about oppressed Islamic women are “white men saving brown women from brown men” – i.e., racists. For Rodriguez, Grenell’s attempt to keep gay Iranians from being hanged or thrown off roofs “might be a case of white men trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men.” You’d think this would be a good thing, but in a world where white people are never right and people of color are never wrong, it’s not.

Rodriguez wasn’t alone. In Britain, the Independentran a story by Louis Staples headlined “Thanks, Donald Trump, but as a gay man I’d rather you didn’t go on a global campaign in my name.” Thanks, Mr. Staples, but if I were a gay man in Iran or some other hellhole, I’d rather you didn’t try to talk the most powerful man in the world out of doing something to prevent my execution.

Staples’s piece was more of the same: “The Trump administration’s unlikely foray into the realm of LGBT+ rights is just the latest in a long tradition of far-right parties attempting to rebrand themselves as pro-gay. Marine Le Pen surrounded herself with gay advisers during the 2017 French presidential election. Geert Wilders from Holland – the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage – cherishes the ‘tolerance of homosexuality’ as a Dutch value. Alice Weidel, leader of Germany’s far right party Alternative for Germany, is a lesbian. So is Britain’s Anne Marie Waters, who was even considered too right-wing for UKIP. Tommy Robinson even said in 2015 that he wants to ‘fight for a gay man’s rights.’”

Staples summed up all this as follows: “These people have one thing common: they loathe Islam and want you to hate it too.” Yeah, they loathe Islam at least in part because it condemns gay people to death. But for the proud bridge-builders at the Independent, as for their counterparts at Out, admitting this reprehensible truth is a bridge too far.

So it stands. For a few weeks, at least, the hero of the American left, and especially of America’s gay-left establishment, was a TV actor who did something incredibly selfish based on the premise that Trump and his supporters are racists and homophobes. Meanwhile the most prominent gay member of the Trump administration is taking real action to help gay people around the world – and the same professional gays who unquestioningly bought Jussie’s shaggy-dog story are, out of sheer irrational Trump-hatred, distancing themselves from what may well be one of the most significant human-rights initiatives in decades.

Such is the state of gay activism in the Western world today. Even as the lockstep soldiers of the gay-left establishment (which has never been about helping people, but about using gay-rights rhetoric to win gay support for Democratic politicians and “progressive” policies) keep promoting the transsexual agenda and keep denying that Islam is an existential threat to gays, the president whom they’ve cast in the role of their #1 enemy is taking on Islamic regimes in an attempt to help gay people around the world to whose plight that gay-left establishment is indifferent. They call themselves gay activists; but Trump is the real gay-rights hero – an objective fact that they’re obliged to deny in order to keep their tiny heads from exploding."

There was no question the news coverage was going to be massive.

In many ways, that coverage is an object lesson in the foibles of modern reporting. The story showed where news outlets teeter on the line between driving social media and being driven by it, between healthy skepticism and cautious credulity.

“We have the combination of social media and a polarized country converging here,” said Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. Everyone is seeing events “from their political lens. No one is really good at distancing themselves.”

The story began as an account of a hate crime that went viral instantly.

A star of the hit Fox television show “Empire,” Smollett reported that he had been attacked around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 on his way home from a sandwich shop. Smollett — who, like his character, is black and gay — said two masked men shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured bleach on him, beat him and placed a rope around his neck.

He also claimed they shouted, “This is MAGA country” — a reference to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

National media soon got wind of the story. Social media poured rocket fuel on it and set it ablaze.

Celebrities including “Empire” co-star Vivica A. Fox and Oscar winner Viola Davis tweeted their love and support. Talk show host Andy Cohen, who is also gay, tweeted simply: “This. Is. Vile.”

Within hours, now Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — both African-American — compared the attack to an “attempted modern-day lynching.” Even President Donald Trump seemed to take the story at face value.

But as police searched for surveillance footage of the attack, people began to wonder. Two men seen in a video went from being persons of interest to suspects, then to witnesses against Smollett.

It all came crashing down Thursday, when the 36-year-old actor turned himself in and was charged with felony disorderly conduct, an offense that alleges he made a false police report. Police claim Smollett staged the attack, enlisting two brothers who were his friends because he was unhappy with his salary.

After Smollett was charged, it seemed people who had been holding back suddenly felt free to admit they had doubts all along.

CNN anchor Don Lemon — who met Smollett during a guest appearance on “Empire” — said his initial reaction to the attack was not disbelief but “sadness.”

“I wasn’t shocked,” Lemon, a black man who came out as gay in 2011, told “Entertainment Tonight.” ”I didn’t like that it happened to him.”

As police waited for Smollett to surrender, Lemon acknowledged Wednesday on CNN that many in the gay and African-American communities “had questions about this from the very beginning, the veracity of this story.”

It was minus 4 degrees that night.

“And let’s be honest,” Lemon said, “there are probably not a whole lot of MAGA fans watching ‘Empire.’”

But Smollett stuck to his story. And until a couple of weeks in, the media had nothing but a “gut” feeling to go on, said Tom Jones, senior media writer for the Florida-based Poynter Institute.

“I think most of the media handled it responsibly, saying, ‘Hey look. Here’s what the allegations are. Here’s what he’s saying. Here’s what he claimed happened. And then we’ll see where the investigation goes from here,’” Jones said.

“The word ‘alleged’ was all over any reference from the moment it was first reported,” Northwestern’s Whitaker added. “I didn’t hear a lot of really super-sympathetic coverage.”

Conservative columnist Ben Shapiro disagrees. He told Fox News that the volume of coverage on Smollett was “enormous” because “there’s a narrative to be promoted.”

“When a story is too perfect to be true, it usually is, and this is one of those cases,” he said.

Joe Saltzman said the Smollett story was a case of sheer “overkill,” even in this era of the 24-hour news cycle.

“This is not good journalism,” Saltzman, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, wrote in an email. “This is gossip and chatter.”

Robin Roberts, anchor of ABC’s “Good Morning America,” came in for some of the harshest criticism for a Feb. 14 exclusive interview with Smollett. Many accused her of failing to push him hard enough.

On Thursday’s show, Roberts called the situation a “setback for race relations,” adding that she “cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides, and you can understand why there would be.”

Trump’s sympathy for Smollett also evaporated. “What about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?” he tweeted Thursday, tagging the actor.

Earlier this week, as Smollett’s story began to unravel, his siblings took to Instagram.

“This is the media, an irresponsible media,” Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jocqui Smollett posted, using a picture and slightly altered quotation from slain civil rights leader Malcolm X. “It will make the criminal look like he’s the victim and make the victim look like he’s the criminal.”

Smollett is free after posting $10,000 in bail, and his attorneys said he maintains his innocence. Today, he was cut from the final two episodes of this season of “Empire.”

During a news conference announcing the charges, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson surveyed the packed room of reporters.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,” he said angrily."

This tweet sums it up:

In 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till walked into a Mississippi store to buy candy. After being accused of whistling at the white woman behind the counter, he was kidnapped, lynched and dumped into a river. https://t.co/tcbBgVxVPt — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 21, 2019



What made the Till story timely this week? Could there be a connection between the Jussie Smollett fiasco and the Times’s interest in the 64-year-old Till case? Steve Sailer actually predicted the Times story on Till a week ago:

As I predicted in a February 15, 2019 iSteve post on the New York Times’ credulous coverage of Jussie’s Hate Hoax: I imagine we’ll once again be deluged with NYT stories about late-breaking developments in the Emmett Till case.

Sailer recalls his own column from last August, which is a pretty brilliant analysis of how the press operates, and why it influences us even when we are aware of its profound bias:

There is always vastly more news than a person can remember. Thus your picture of reality is inevitably distorted to some extent by the power of the media, what I call the Megaphone, to pound over and over into your head certain true news, but not other true news.

***

For example, consider two black teens who once were true news. In 1955, Emmett Till was murdered by two white men who were quickly acquitted, making his story memorable for being one of the last examples from a long era of state-excused white-on-black civilian violence over black males hitting on white females. In 1987, Tawana Brawley launched our present era of making up hate hoaxes against whites by claiming that the reason she got home late was because she was being gang-raped by six white policemen. Which incident is more rationally relevant to 2018? But which does the prestige media consider more au courant?

The statistics that follow call out for an explanation:

In 1980, the name “Emmett Till” did not appear in the pages of the NYT. In 1990 it showed up twice, and in 2000 four times. From 2004 through 2012, the Times mentioned this old incident an average of nine times per year, and from 2013 to 2016 almost two dozen times per year. Last year, “Emmett Till” appeared in 72 different Times articles. And this year is on track for 92 stories about the 63-year-old tragedy.

Tawana Brawley, on the other hand, has gone down the memory hole–to the point where Al Sharpton, of all people, was quoted seriously in the “prestige” media to the effect that Smollett should be punished if he fabricated the MAGA assault!

[I]n the 2010s, Tawana Brawley has come up in only 15 articles versus 249 mentioning Emmett Till.

So, why does the New York Times believe that the Till case has somehow gained ever more relevance, more than a half century after it occurred? Because large numbers of similar cases are taking place? Of course not. Rather, the opposite. Given the lack of racist outrages in contemporary America, the Times has to keep going back to the historical well to fire up its constituency. Some have put this in economic terms:

Black-on-white crime vastly exceeds white-on-black crime, as everyone knows. But the Times stubbornly pursues its partisan agenda.

The problem is that the Megaphone, as Sailer calls it, is effective even though nearly everyone is on to the leftists’ game. I liken the insistent agendas of papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post to annoying jingles in radio and television commercials. We all know what the marketers are up to. Nevertheless, we can’t get the annoying jingles out of our heads."

What is it? It’s a sense of humor, something which has become an endangered species in America recently.

As Ed noted earlier, Charles Barkley went way off script and (with an assist from Shaq) poked some hilarious fun at Jussie Smollett. On its own, that would have been a breath of fresh air but it turns out the Daily Show actually did a spoof and it’s genuinely funny. I’ve watched this three times and it makes me laugh every time. I’m not sure what my favorite part is. It’s a close call between the explanation of the bleach and the refrain “And gay!” uttered by the same character. I don’t know who the actor is (I don’t watch the Daily Show) but he’s hilarious.

I don’t want to get too carried away, but having a few media figures who are black sort of lead the nation in laughing over this seems like a pretty significant thing after the past couple weeks. This hoax was an attempt to tear the nation apart in the ugliest way possible. And there were lots of people who seized on the story eager to use it for that purpose. Laughing at this is probably the best way to heal some of the bad feelings it has generated. At least for a few moments, the laughter puts us all back on the same side.

Anyway, enjoy this brief respite. Next week it’s back to taking everything with utmost seriousness and being deeply hurt and offended by every joke."

A painstaking review of more than four dozen surveillance cameras — including some hidden in residents’ doorbells — helped Chicago investigators uncover Jussie Smollett’s alleged hate hoax, police said.

Police Commander Edward Wodnicki recalled step-by-step how police tracked down the two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who say they were paid by the “Empire” star to help him stage his own hate assault.

Cops culled footage from about 35 Chicago police “pod” cameras in the Streeterville neighborhood where Smollett lives and where the attack took place on Jan. 29, as well from more than 20 private cameras, including the hidden gadgets.

“I gotta say, that was super helpful in this investigation,” Wodnicki said at a press conference this week. “The city came together to investigate and help the police with this crime.”

“It was because of these pod cameras, our investment into technology the City of Chicago and the great assistance from the community in giving us those other cameras that led us to a really solid timeline of where our two persons of interest went,” he said.

Police worked backward to track the Osundairos’ movements — learning that the two beefy men fled on foot and then jumped in a cab after the allegedly staged attack.

The cab was located and led cops to a critical piece of the puzzle: a ride-share car the duo hailed to get to the scene of the supposed assault.

“That was the lead that we needed in order to identify the two persons of interest,” Wodnicki said. “At that point, we had a real good timeline of where these two people went.”"

Chicago police claim Smollett, who is gay and black, engineered an elaborate hoax in late January to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck, sending himself a hate-filled letter and then hiring two people to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him in downtown Chicago.

The producers of the Fox television program, on which Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, had repeatedly expressed their support for the actor prior to the police allegations that the attack was a hoax.

But on Friday, they said in a statement that they had “decided to remove the role” from the final two episodes of the current season “to avoid further disruption on set.”

It was not immediately clear if Smollett might return in a future season of the program.

“The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us, the producers said while adding that Smollett was “an important member of our EMPIRE family.”

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”

Smollett was arrested Thursday and charged with a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. He was freed on a $100,000 bond.

The actor’s lawyers maintained his innocence and accused law enforcement of wanting to “skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

The case has drawn intense national interest with everyone from politicians to celebrities and late night talk show hosts commenting.

Law enforcement officials said the allegations against the actor were backed by evidence such as a cashed check, text messages and phone records.

It was a shocking loss against a shadowy YouTube ‘stream-ripper’.

Now, major labels Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment are appealing a quick defeat at the hands of Russia-based stream-ripper FLVTO.biz. The major labels are being represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), alongside hired counsel Jenner & Block.

Earlier this year, the RIAA-led legal team suffered an embarrassing defeat against FLVTO.biz and its owner, Tofig Kurbanov, who also operates 2conv.com. In a quick and decisive judgment, U.S. District Court judge Claude M. Hilton tossed the case on jurisdictional grounds.

Jenner & Block insisted that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Court of Virginia was the correct venue against a site operator in Russia, though Hilton strongly disagreed based on the irrelevance of the state to the site. But Hilton took things further by blocking a refiling in any other U.S. District Court, including the Southern District of California.

The seemingly sloppy legal work was actually part of a well-worn strategy that backfired.

Essentially, the RIAA planned on Kurbanov not responding, a situation that produces fast, decisive victories that can then be used to shut down numerous sites in a category. In fact, leading up to the actual proceedings, the RIAA had little idea who Kurbanov was, and even added multiple ‘John Does’ to the defendants list.

But Kurbanov not only responded, he responded with a serious legal defense team spanning multiple law firms. Suddenly, Kurbanov was outsmarting the RIAA’s seasoned legal team, and outmaneuvering them into an early defeat.

But this ain’t over yet. Earlier this week, the major labels filed a notice of appeal, with a formal appeal expected within the next few months. That’s according to Val Gurvits of Boston Law Group, PC, one of three firms defending Kurbanov, FLVTO.biz, and 2conv.com.

Jonathan Lamy, the RIAA’s PR person, did not respond to an inquiry on Friday.

Earlier, Gurvits predicted that an appeal was on the way. But the attorney told us that the timetable will be slow. In an email exchange this week, Gurvits said he expects the RIAA’s appeal to be filed in a few months, with a decision handed down in a year’s time.

Ultimately, the opening salvo in this battle won’t be decided until 2020. All of which gives FLVTO.biz considerable room to maneuver, especially given that the legality of YouTube stream-ripping has yet to be argued."

According to Page Six, he made the claim after surrendering to authorities on Thursday on a fourth-degree felony charge of filing a false police report.

As CrimeOnline previously reported, the 36-year-old actor claimed he was attacked last month outside of a Chicago-area Subway restaurant by a pair of assailants shouting racist and homophobic taunts.

Investigators have since alleged that he paid two acquaintances to orchestrate the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary from the television series.

Smollett might be planning to cite his drug problem as a mitigating factor that could reduce his sentence if he is ultimately convicted, TMZ reported.

According to court documents, he denied having problems with alcohol or mental issues. But authorities have already claimed that he purchased illegal narcotics from Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, one of the two brothers Smollett allegedly paid to stage the assault.

The show’s production company confirmed Smollett’s character has been cut from the final two episodes of the season, according to CNN.

Following his release on bail, he reportedly visited the set to apologize for the embarrassment the ordeal has caused while maintaining he is innocent of the allegations against him.

His legal team previously released a similar statement on his behalf.

“Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,” the statement read. “The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

Adding hilarious fuel to that fire, on Friday morning, Noah tweeted a brilliant parody of the Smollett plot to frame Trump supporters for a fake hate crime, cooked up over a supposed paltry salary of $60,000+ an episode.

It’s a truly hilarious bit, reminiscent of those old 80s afterschool specials but with a True Crime vibe that makes it better than anything SNL has done in quite a while.

It’s fantastic. But see for yourself. I’ll leave you with this teaser:

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ″Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

“Empire” has nine episodes left to air in its fifth season; the last two episodes are still being worked on.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camera that he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars."

And Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's defense of infanticide?

Now Vermont, with Democrats in the majority, has gone further, and talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh is warning that the Democratic Party is ""becoming sick, and it's getting sicker by the day.""

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

""'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up,' the new theme song of the Democrat Party. 'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up,' not to be cowboys or anything,"" he said. ""I'm telling you, folks, you want to find out – you want to know – why there's rampant crime? You want to know why inexplicable deterioration is happening to our culture? Look no further than this kind of thinking.""

Limbaugh decried the ""wanton devaluing of life and the total loss of the appreciation for the sanctity of life and for the miracle of life.""

""To just casually be able to discard this? By a political party? You don't think that has deleterious, dramatically destructive impacts on society at large? Thirteen-year-olds are shooting 10-year-olds and people are asking themselves, 'How can this happen?' Look no further than stuff like this,"" he said.

""If life is cheap, if life is not special, if life doesn’t have anything noteworthy about it, then nobody is going to have any appreciation for it at any stage of it. My God, this is Satanic! This is just – and they pass these bills and they end up applauding and whooping it up, and I still maintain that one of the primary reasons for that is that they are celebrating victory over us, that they are just loving cramming it down our throats. They love getting in our face and telling us to go to hell, and this is one of the ways in which they're doing it.""

He said his concern was raised by a vote in the Vermont legislature to pass H. 57, ""which would legalize abortion at any stage of pregnancy and for any reason.""

""Folks, they are off to the races on this. First it was the New York State Senate with a standing ovation after the law was passed that you can even perform an abortion during birth and after! They stood up with a standing ovation. Shortly after that, the governor of Virginia came out, Ralph Northam, and he basically endorsed the same thing. And then we heard that out of New Mexico, they are working on similar legislation.""

The Vermont bill states, ""Every individual who becomes pregnant has the fundamental right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, give birth to a child, or to have an abortion.""

Limbaugh explained the legislation ""is far more radical than the recent expansion of late-term abortion in New York, as well as the proposed expansions in Virginia and Rhode Island.""

The New York and Virginia bills allow abortion for any reason up to viability and have ""health"" exceptions that are often loosely interpreted to permit abortion on demand after viability as well.

But the Vermont bill ""offers a blanket permission slip for any and all abortion, throughout pregnancy, and for any reason.""

Further, the bill specifically dehumanizes the unborn, stating, ""A fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus shall not have independent rights under Vermont law."""

On her Instagram stories on Thursday, Kardashian published a series of cryptic quotes, including where she seems to reference Woods.

“The worst pain is getting hurt by a person you explained your hurt to,” the post said. Kardashian later seemed to suggest that the “betrayal” was a blessing in disguise.

“Somebody needs to hear this…that betrayal was your blessing!!!”, she posted.

The final post appears to reference Thompson, where she appeared to have a message for him as he moves on.

“If they ask you about me, tell them: ‘She was the only person that loved me with honesty, and I broke her.'”

Kardashian later took to Twitter where she began liking various posts referencing the broken relationship, including her best friend Malika Haqq, who has been loudly defending Kardashian online.

Kardashian later liked a tweet published by a fan’s account. The fan claimed that they had spoken to Kardashian via DM and said that the reality star expressed gratitude for their support.

“I spoke to Khloé on IG DM and she wanted me to let you all know that she loves us all and that she can’t ‘thank God enough for each and every one of us,” the tweet said. “I notified her that I’m here to pass this message along.”

Kardashian then liked a post that encouraged her not to blame herself for Thompson’s infidelity. Thompson, who currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, has a history of cheating on Kardashian.

Smollett claimed that he was attacked in Chicago in late January by two men shouting racial and homophobic slurs and insisting that they were in “MAGA country.” Roberts interviewed Smollett on “Good Morning America” (GMA) last week about the alleged hate crime, despite some red flags being raised about his story.

During the interview, Smollett tearfully insisted he was telling the truth about the attack and reacted angrily at people who were doubting his story. Roberts said she found him “credible.”

“If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more,” Smollett insisted.

The day before the interview aired, Chicago police arrested two Nigerian brothers who are extras on “Empire” in connection to the attack. Just 12 hours after the interview, local Chicago stations began reporting that Smollett was now a suspect in his own case. Smollett was arrested on charges of filing a false police report Thursday morning.

However, staffers at GMA are apparently not that upset that Roberts got duped, instead defending her decision to have the interview.

“It was an interview everyone wanted,” one GMA staffer told BuzzFeed News.

“There’s not really a spirit of regret about the Jussie interview,” another BuzzFeed source claimed. “And no one feels that Robin got duped. Taken advantage of, yes, but not duped.”

Another source suggested that Roberts was a victim who was “lied” to by Smollett, while a network executive said the interview is “central to the story as a whole.”

Roberts spoke out about her interview with Smollett on Monday, explaining that she thought the timing of the interview was unfortunate. (RELATED: ‘Good Morning America’ Has Robin Roberts Breaks Silence On Smollett Interview)

“When I sat down with Jussie, it was Tuesday night in Chicago, at the time to give his first account — publicly give his first account — of what he said happened,” Roberts said. “And we have to remember, at that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. This was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

In the same way you can watch Hallmark movies to better understand some women’s daydreams, you can watch Vice to get a gander at the absurd, small-minded and hate-filled imaginings of leftists.

To say the movie’s political views are simplistic is to insult simplism. Cheney is a conniving moral monster who bombs nations for profit. His president, George W. Bush, is an idiot, whom Cheney leads by the nose. Democrats are good. They put solar panels on the White House roof to save the planet! Republicans are bad. They do mean things for mean reasons because they are mean.

It’s a child’s view of the world, full of tendentious factual distortions and lies. But then director McKay is a Socialist, so he is a child in effect, or at least he knows what a child knows about economics, human nature and history — namely nothing.

What is so revealing about the film though is that it’s about Bush. Not Donald Trump. Bush. It’s a reminder that the hatred and rage, the wild charges of racism, and the madcap conspiracy theories with which the left has disgraced itself during the Trump administration are not anomalous, not directed at the outsized Trump specifically. This is just how the left thinks about the rest of us in every administration all the time. Republicans are either stupid like Eisenhower, Reagan and W, or they are evil like Nixon and Cheney, or they are both stupid and evil like Donald Trump.

And it’s not just the politicians either. This is how the left sees you too. Stupid, evil or both.

The fact that this silly film has been nominated for a best picture Oscar is a message from Harvey-Weinstein-World to half of America. The message is two words long. The second word is you.

If Vice is how leftists imagine life, it’s no wonder they have to spend so much time and energy preventing their childishly black-and-white viewpoint from being debunked by the complicated truth.

They have to take pains to insure that every movie, every television show, every comedy act, every news program, every college course reflects their ideas and only their ideas. They have to invent and propound primitive racist theories like Intersectionalism that give them license to categorize all disagreements as hateful. And if even that’s not enough, they have to hire friends to commit hate crimes against them so the world seems to look the way they think it looks.

They so surround themselves with people who agree with them, so immerse themselves in their imaginary narratives, they don’t even know they’re demonizing their opponents, they just think (as one leftist says in Vice) they’re relating the simple facts.

When actor Jussie Smollett reported the hate crime that police now say was an elaborate hoax, CNN’s Brooke Baldwin mourned, “This is America in 2019.” When media race scammer Nathan Philips started a scene with some innocent Trump-supporting Catholic school kids, CNN’s Ana Navarro falsely described the incident as, “Native-American elder taunted by racist MAGA-hat wearing teens…”

These people don’t even know that their brains are suffocating in the plastic bag of their own narrative. Who would tell them? They have demonized, blacklisted and condemned everyone who disagrees with them. They have chased them out of Hollywood. They have banned them from speaking at colleges. They have de-platformed them on social media.

While Vice is Oscar-nominated, the TV mini-series Path to 9/11 will not be released on DVD because it accurately depicts Bill Clinton’s failure to kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance.

While it becomes more and more clear that the Justice Department’s coup attempt against Donald Trump is one of the great scandals in American history, “journalists” are spending their time speculating on whether Donald Trump is a Russian spy.

Desperate to protect their simplistic imaginations from the healthy debate and interchange of the real and complex world, leftists have transformed themselves into willful idiots. They don’t know what they don’t know. And they don’t know that they don’t know."

Smollett might as well have been living in the Big Brother house. I believe Fox could actually film episodes of “Empire” just by using the city’s surveillance cameras.

Anyway, now we have to decide if this discredits every future claim of a racist attack. So I will go out on another limb and say that if, God forbid, Mr. Smollett is actually attacked – yes, he is going to have some credibility challenges. He may want to get himself a couple of bodyguards.

But just because this was made up doesn’t mean they all are. We also heard this headline:

“Now to the arrest of a U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant. Christopher Hasson is his name, a self-described white nationalist. Officials say they believe Hasson was not just fantasizing, but was serious about carrying out his plans for mass murder.”

… A little reminder that the real thing is still out there.

By the way, I’m glad Smollett’s two buddies cooperated with the cops, but could I just observe that it would have been even better if, when Smollett proposed his little plan, they’d just said “Jussie why don’t you just go in and ask for a raise like everybody else?”"

He is charged with lying to police about allegedly staging a hoax hate crime Police say Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary

The move came a day after the 36-year-old was charged with lying to Chicago police about the allegedly staged incident, in which he said two masked men beat him and slung a noose around his neck while yelling racist and homophobic abuse.

Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, will be removed from the final two episodes of the current season of Empire, according to 20th Century Fox Television, which said it wanted to avoid ""further disruption"" on the set of the show.

Smollett faces up to three years in prison if convicted in the case, which has become fodder for the culture wars that have roiled the United States since Donald Trump's 2016 election.

""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us,"" Empire's co-creators and producers said in a statement. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.""

Lawyers for Smollett did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. On Wednesday, they said they were conducting a thorough investigation to form an aggressive defence.

According to court documents, the black and openly gay actor wrote a personal cheque for $US3,500 to two brothers and gave them $US100 to buy the rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball caps that were used in the supposed attack on January 29.

Police said Smollett hoped the incident would advance his career and secure him a higher salary.

Detectives interviewed more than 100 people, reviewed footage from more than 55 surveillance cameras, and executed more than 50 search warrants during the investigation. Officials did not spell out how Smollett had hoped to boost his salary by staging such a hoax.

Actor out on bail

A judge set bail at $US100,000 on Thursday and ordered Smollett to surrender his passport. He was released after paying 10 per cent of the bail amount as stipulated by the judge.

According to an unnamed source cited by CNN, Smollett apologised to the cast and crew on the set of Empire late on Thursday, but maintained his innocence.

While Smollett initially received an outpouring of support on social media from fans, celebrities and some politicians, others were sceptical about the attack, which he said took place outside his Chicago apartment at 2:00am on a frigid night.

Among those who supported the actor were Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. On Thursday, Ms Harris said in a statement she was ""sad, frustrated and disappointed"" by the latest reports. Ms Gillibrand said she would wait to find out the facts before making another statement.

In his account, the actor said his attackers also shouted ""This is MAGA country,"" referring to Mr Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Mr Trump initially described the alleged attack on Smollett as ""horrible."" After the actor was charged on Thursday, Trump tweeted at him: ""(W)hat about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?""

The President's critics have said his rhetoric has fuelled racism and violence, while his supporters say the press has unfairly cast Mr Trump and his supporters in a bad light.

The actor relayed a horrific story of being victimized in a hate crime, but then came the twist: He allegedly orchestrated the whole thing. That Smollett, who is black, would go to such drastic lengths to fake the incident is a quintessential example of “victimhood chic,” argues John McWhorter—having fame and wealth wasn’t enough for the actor; he also was seeking to become the poster child against MAGA-style racism. Faking hate crimes is exceedingly rare, and the Smollett drama could lead some to question the damage done by future incidents. Adam Serwer writes that Smollett’s mendacity isn’t the exoneration of Trumpism that some of the president’s supporters have suggested.

Dieting fads typically call for pared-down meals that leave people feeling famished for most of the day. But a new trend called “intuitive eating,” founded by the dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, encourages people to eat whatever they want.

“Intuitive eating sounds like permission to sit on your couch and eat pizza until you pass out. But Tribole and Bahr don’t deny that different foods have different nutritional benefits, or aim to tear down public-health initiatives that tell kids to eat vegetables. Instead, they say they want to help people who have struggled with eating understand how food makes their body feel when the act is untangled from stress or shame. Both Tribole and Bahr find that in the first week or two, new adherents of intuitive eating do sometimes binge on the things they had always tried to skip. But the two researchers say the vast majority of their clients quickly habituate to burgers or donuts and then crave the variety and nutrition represented by the ‘healthy’ foods they once used as punishment.”

Why do some people think blank-faced cats are psychopaths? It has all to do with their resting cat face.

“Cats, she pointed out, simply don’t have the facial muscles to make the variety of expressions a dog (or human) can. So when we look at a cat staring at us impassively, it looks like a psychopath who cannot feel or show emotion. But that’s just its face. Cats communicate not with facial expressions but through the positions of their ears and tails. Their emotional lives can seem inscrutable—and even nonexistent—until you spend a lot of time getting to know one.”

Smollett fingered Abimbola ""Abel"" Osundario - one of the two brothers the 'Empire' star allegedly paid $3,500 to beat him up - as his drug dealer, selling him 'Molly' several times since the spring of 2018 according to text messages.

Police say Smollett text messaged Osundario asking for the drug - a street name for ecstacy.

Word of Smollett's drug problem comes as TVLine reports 'Empire' producers are considering bringing in a new actor to play the role of Jamal. Co-creator Lee Daniels - who reportedly loosely based the character on himself, is said to be a big fan of the idea.

20th Century Fox said on Friday that while they will wait for the legal process to play out, they ""have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.""

Smollett was arrested early Thursday after turning himself in on a felony criminal charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in connection with the hate crime 'attack.'

And in a sign that the left has finally accepted the situation, the Daily Show mocked the Smollett situation on Friday:"

According to TMZ, the 36-year-old actor made the claim Thursday, after surrendering to police on a felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false report. The outlet points out that this detail may be relevant to the case, as Smollett is believed to have purchased drugs from one of the brothers who allegedly helped him stage a phony hate crime.

Prosecutors said they have reviewed text messages indicating Abel Osundairo had sold Smollett ""designer drugs"" several times since spring 2018. TMZ notes that if the Empire star is convicted, he could use his alleged substance abuse problem as a ""mitigating factor"" in his sentencing.

Legal documents also show Smollett answered ""no"" when asked if he had any alcohol or mental health problems.

On Jan. 29, Smollett told authorities he had been physically attacked by two masked men at around 2 a.m. that day. The actor claimed the perpetrators had beat him, tied a noose around his neck, and poured a chemical substance—believed to be bleach—on him. Smollett also told officers the men shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him and referenced Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

Weeks after Smollett gave his report, officers arrested brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo in connection with the attack. The men were eventually released without any charges, and reportedly told authorities Smollett had paid them $3,500 to help orchestrate the assault. Smollett's legal team has denied these allegations on the actor's behalf.

""Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system,"" his representatives said in a statement Thursday. ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.""

Smollett was released from police custody Thursday on $100,000 bond. He's expected to enter a plea at his next court hearing March 14"

After all, I'm white. And male. And conservative.

So, by default, I'm part of the problem. Guilty. Of something.

Even though the Jussie Smollett story was a total hoax, we are to believe that it revealed the real problem in America. Angry white supremacists are destroying the country. Voting for Trump is akin to membership in the KKK. War has been declared against the African-American community.

Nothing can threaten that narrative.

And so, even if the Smollett story is false, it's actually still true.

TRENDING: White House condemns TV host's 'insensitive' mocking of Barron Trump

At least some pundits wish it were. It so wonderfully confirmed their biases and prejudices.

In the aftermath of the Smollett debacle, then, rather than deep soul searching, for some (like CNN's Van Jones), there's only one concern: How will this affect black Americans?

As for conservative white Americans, all hostility toward them is justified.

Just because they didn't put the noose around Smollett's neck, doesn't mean they didn't want to.

Van Jones put it like this: ""What I do want to say is that whatever [Jussie Smollett] is going through to do what he did has hurt the cause against racism and the cause against homophobia, if it's true. If there is any way that they can be redeemed, I hope it can be. He owes those same young black gay men in that interview. He owes them not just an apology but a lifetime of atonement. Because this ain't nothing to play with, and if he was playing with it, shame on him.""

Yes, shame on Smollett. And yes, he needs to make amends.

But Jones is missing the elephant in the room, namely, the justification of anti-white sentiments, sentiments that were whipped into a frenzy by comment after comment by pundit after pundit and celebrity after celebrity, all of whom embraced the Smollett story without question.

Van Jones and his colleagues need to be asking: What about the insult to conservative white Americans? What about the long-term after-effects?

To be candid, I've interacted with a lot of people about this story, some in the media but most not. Yet in all my interaction, I've not heard from a single person who drew general conclusions about blacks based on this debacle.

I've not heard from anyone who said, ""I'll tell you what. These African-Americans are always fabricating hate crimes to make themselves look like victims.""

Hardly.

In stark contrast, as has been demonstrated in article after article and commentary after commentary, all kinds of conclusions were drawn about conservative white Americans after the Smollett story.

Ugly conclusions. Vicious conclusions. Dangerous conclusions.

And those conclusions were felt to be justified, even without any confirming evidence. Even though the story was suspect from the start.

No facts were needed. Conservative whites (especially males) are guilty. Always.

Simply stated, the hoax attack served to confirm the anti-white, anti-conservative sentiments that are so prevalent in our society today. That hatred was stirred up as long as the shaky story could be maintained.

Now that it has collapsed, I don't expect to see a lot of hatred coming to blacks (or even to gays) in general. That's not the popular narrative, and that's not where Van Jones and others will be focusing.

But rather than asking, ""How will this hoax affect black Americans?"" they should be asking themselves, ""How have we fueled the fires of racism and prejudice? How have we contributed to anti-white, anti-conservative sentiment? What can we do to work against that? And what can we learn from the Jussie Smollet incident?""

According to Jones, Smollett was ""an icon … a beloved character … a Jackie Robinson [sic!] against homophobia in the black community, an icon, a beloved icon.""

And so, in his eyes, Smollett's betrayal of his people is all the more painful and consequential. But note again his words, quoted earlier, and speaking of ""the cause against racism and the cause against homophobia."" Jones said, ""If there is any way that they can be redeemed, I hope it can be.""

Redeemed? As in, ""If there is any way that the anti-white, anti-conservative narrative supported by the hoax crime can be redeemed, I hope it can be""?

Or does Jones really think that suddenly, because of the Smollett hoax, Americans will no longer care about anti-black racism or ""homophobia""?

It's almost as if the talking heads on the left, whatever their color, are really upset the story isn't true. It's as if they are not color blind but rather blinded by color.

For them, the Smollett story served a great (and ugly) purpose, and it's a shame that it couldn't be sustained.

The real irony in all this is that those who have been the objects of racial prejudice have become the practitioners of racial prejudice.

Those deemed guilty simply because of the (black) color of their skin have now damned others because of the (white) color of their skin.

Will we never learn?"

By Don Babwin, Associated Press

CHICAGO (AP) — Actor Jussie Smollett’s character on “Empire” will be removed from the final two episodes of this season in the wake of his arrest on charges that he staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself last month in downtown Chicago, producers of the Fox TV show announced Friday.

The announcement came a day after Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” ”Empire” executive producers Lee Daniels, Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer said in a written statement. “We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were still being made when Smollett was charged. At this point, Smollett is part of the seven already completed episodes.

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

Police said Smollett planned the hoax because he was unhappy with his salary and wanted to promote his career. Before the attack, he also sent a letter that threatened him to the Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot, police said.

As authorities laid out their case against Smollett, the narrative that emerged Thursday sounded like that of a filmmaker who wrote, cast, directed and starred in a short movie.

Prosecutors said Smollett gave detailed instructions to the accomplices who helped him stage the attack in January, including telling them specific slurs to yell, urging them to shout “MAGA country” and even pointing out a surveillance camerathat he thought would record the beating.

“I believe Mr. Smollett wanted it on camera,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a Thursday morning news conference. “But unfortunately that particular camera wasn’t pointed in that direction.”

Smollett’s legal team issued a statement Thursday night, calling the actor a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.” The statement called Johnson’s news conference “an organized law enforcement spectacle.”

“The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett,” the statement read.

Smollett is earning more than $100,000 per episode, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because salary details were involved. The studio declined to comment on the actor’s salary.

As is customary with a successful TV series, regular cast members on “Empire” received a boost in pay as part of contract extensions that followed the drama’s renewal for a second season, the person said.

Smollett is counted among the series regulars.

Late last January, Jussie Smollett, a black and openly gay actor known for his role on FX’s Empire, reported to the Chicago Police Department a series of hate crimes directed at him. On January 22, a homophobic and racist letter threatening his life was sent. One week later, January 29, Smollett reported being assaulted by two men in Chicago. They reportedly shouted a variety of slurs, wrapped a noose around Smollett’s neck, and said “This is MAGA country!” The same day, Chicago PD began investigating these incidents as hate crimes.

Outrage brewed over the days, coming from the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris, Ellen DeGeneres, and all across social media. OUT FRONT even followed this story over the weeks.

There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes. https://t.co/QAi0IYtSeR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 30, 2019

But as the investigation turned up little, skepticism mounted.The first turn in the story came on February 16, when Chicago PD detectives told the Chicago Tribune that they were investigating whether Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the whole incident. Smollett and his attorneys denied this vehemently. Four days later, Chicago PD and the Cook County state attorney charged Smollett with filing a false police report, a felony offense.

Finally, on February 21, Smollett turned himself in to Chicago PD, was arrested, his mugshot taken, and later released on $100,000 bond. The superintendent of the Chicago PD held a press conference on the case and stated that Smollett staged the attack and threatening letter because he was “dissatisfied with his salary on Empire.” Future court proceedings will eventually determine the fate of Jussie Smollett the man. The narrative ended February 22, exactly a month after the letter was allegedly sent, when Empire executives officially dropped Smollett from the show, leaving him stained likely forever.

Jussie Smollett is a visible figure, a (former) actor on a popular TV show. He is black, openly gay, vocal about his support for LGBTQ issues. The story of this targeted, explicit, chilling hate crime occupied queer media, social media, and mainstream news for nearly a month. It felt “perfect:” an incident that captured an intersection of race, orientation, political affiliation, in a major American city. It was a visible, volatile, tense flashpoint for a tense, volatile country in a tense, volatile time.

And it was a hoax. A goof. A sweeping piece of performance art that an actor engaged in to gain some publicity and boost his salary. Undoubtedly, Jussie Smollett did an inflaming, selfish, very serious thing that undermined not only the victims of actual hate crimes, but the LGBTQ communities and communities of color that he associated with and spoke for. Jussie Smollett’s stunt may have set these communities back years, and he deserves every ounce of blame and shame set on him.

Like most of you, I've seen the reports about Jussie Smollett, and I'm sad, frustrated, and disappointed. pic.twitter.com/91OHOymShi — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 21, 2019

Now that we’ve gotten the question of blame out of our system, we need to ask: what do we do now?

What do we do now that every report of a hate crime against a person of color or a queer person will be met with skepticism and doubt? Victims of real hate crimes, abuses, and assaults are all going to face the familiar stonewall propped up again by this farce: “I don’t believe you.” In the long run, that disbelief and doubt will excuse future hate crimes. “That Jussie Smollett guy faked it; you could be faking it too.”

Two days after Chicago PD detectives reported that Smollett may have staged what he staged, Scott Nevins from NewNowNext said about believing Smollett’s story and not apologizing for believing it: “I come from the school of always believing the victim, whether it be from sexual assault, violent hate crimes, hazing, or bullying, until proven that I shouldn’t. It’s the safest way to ensure we protect real victims.”

That was when allegations of a hoax were fresh. Now, with Smollett arrested, surrendered, charged, and dropped from Empire, should be the time to jettison him from the conversation. The longer we, as a community, continue talking about this story, the worse we will look.

But this whole debacle reveals a vulnerability that’s latent in any community, like a queer community, with a history of being marginalized, victimized, and oppressed. We, as a community, are constantly vigilant for injustice, ready to passionately defend ourselves and our own when we feel it. The fact that Smollett’s stunt garnered the response it did from queer media outlets, this one included, speaks to this.

Nevins isn’t wrong in suggesting we continue to support and believe victims of injustice, big and small, until proven that we shouldn’t. Of course we should listen to victims and support them and seek justice. But we also need to be careful, a little more on guard, and prepared to accept the possibility that we’ve been played. Because the story of Jussie Smollett could embolden more opportunists looking to stoke a fire, and actual committers of hate crimes finding a new excuse.

Democratic politicians and celebrities called it a shocking instance of Trump-era racism and hate. Republicans now depict it as yet another example of liberals and mainstream media rushing to judgment while disparaging the president’s supporters as bigots.

The case of “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett encapsulates the polarized state of political discourse in America.

With Smollett now accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack on himself , the case seemed to inflame political tensions even more while creating potentially damaging consequences for genuine hate crime victims in the future.

“The danger is that it will cause people to respond with skepticism whenever they hear reports of hate violence, even though the overwhelming majority of those reports are completely true,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Smollett, who is black and gay, is accused of filing a false police report last month asserting that he was attacked in Chicago by two men who beat him, targeted him with slurs, and yelled “This is MAGA country” — an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were among those who sided with Smollett early on and called the incident a “modern-day lynching.” They soon found themselves under attack from the right as Smollett’s story began to fall apart.

Trump initially called reports of the attack “horrible.” On Thursday, he tweeted, “what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?”

Harris tweeted Thursday that she was “sad, frustrated and disappointed” at Smollett’s alleged staging of the attack.

Editor and commentator Jarrett Stepman of The Daily Signal, an online publication of the conservative The Heritage Foundation, faulted left-of-center pundits and politicians for seizing immediately on Smollett’s claims in a bid to score political points.

“Instead of just treating this as a serious crime, it was used as a political bludgeon to malign large swaths of Americans,” he said. “There was a rush to find a story to attack half the country.”

However, Stepman said he shared concerns that the case might have unfortunate consequences for real victims who deserve support and compassion.

“Heinous hate crimes do exist in this country, but it’s the ‘boy who cried wolf’ thing,” Stepman said. “People become cynical, and that’s not a healthy thing for American society.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson had a hard time holding back his frustration over the allegation that a gay black man like Smollett would concoct such a story given the real struggles in the city with racial divisions and hate crimes.

He expressed similar concerns about how hate crimes are handled in the future because of this case while recognizing how his city became a participant in a national political debate.

“Celebrities, news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,” said Johnson, who is black and grew up in Chicago.

In the debate over the Smollett case, critics of Trump have pointed out that hate crimes have soared since his election, but the statistics are nuanced.

The most recent official figures from the FBI show that there was a 17 percent spike in hate crimes in 2017. But that data isn’t complete because it’s based in part on voluntary reporting by police agencies across the country.

Non-government researchers have come up with a variety of findings. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism in Cal State San Bernardino looked at hate crimes in the nation’s 10 biggest cities and found a 12 percent increase in 2017. There were similar annual increases during the Obama administration.

Shannon Minter said hate crimes already are underreported, and worried that the Smollett case would aggravate that problem.

However, Minter said he was heartened by some recent moves across the political spectrum to address racism and hate violence. He cited efforts by the Southern Baptist Convention, a generally conservative denomination, to acknowledge its past legacy of racism.

Robin Valeri, a psychology professor at St. Bonaventure University who has researched hate crimes, said the Smollett case reminded her of the 1987 case involving Tawana Brawley, a black teenager from New York state who falsely alleged that she was abducted and raped by a gang of white men.

“These cases make people skeptical,” Valeri said. “The assumption is going to be, ‘Oh, they’re just making it up.'”

Among the black activists who championed Brawley’s case before it unraveled was civil rights leader Al Sharpton.

Speaking Thursday on MSNBC, Sharpton called the hoax claims against Smollett “horrific” and said the actor, if proven guilty, “ought to face accountability to the maximum.”

Alvin Tillery, a political science professor who directs Northwestern University’s Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy, said racial hoaxes — including the Brawley case — have a long history in the United States.

“The Smollett case is likely to have an even larger impact on our politics and culture than those infamous hoaxes because of Mr. Smollett’s celebrity status and our deeply troubling political climate,” said Tillery, who is black.

The wall-to-wall media coverage that the case generated also left some people frustrated.

“There’s a lot of racial and anti-Semitic violence in this country that we didn’t even know about,” said Heidi Beirich, who heads the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project. “It outweighs one sensational fake crime.”

The Chicago police chief began his news conference Thursday by acknowledging the throng of reporters in front of him and declaring, “I just wish that the families of gun violence got this much attention.”"

According to TVLine, Jussie Smollett’s future on Empire isn’t looking good. The series is said to be trying to figure out what direction the show will head following the actor’s arrest for allegedly staging an attack against himself, which he called a hate crime.

Sources tell the outlet that the show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, loosely based the character of Jamal after himself, and is strongly suggesting recasting the role if and when Smollett is officially let go from the series.

On Friday, the network announced that they would removing Jussie from the final two episodes of the series to “avoid further disruption on set.” Following Smollett’s arrest and bail hearing, the actor went straight to the Empire set, where he reportedly apologized to the cast and crew, and maintained his innocence in the process.

“While these allegations are very disturbing. We are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,” the statement added, seemingly confirming that the network will see what happens with Jussie going forward, and if he is convicted on the felony charges of filing a false police report.

Meanwhile, any casting changes wouldn’t take effect until Season 6 of the show, which isn’t a given. Although the series is the network’s No. 2 rated drama, it has yet to be renewed for next season, but hopes are high that the series will come back, barring that Jussie Smollett’s drama doesn’t disrupt the plans.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing,” a statement from Jussie’s legal team read, following his arrest.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jussie’s Empire cast and crew members are said to be furious with him for all of the bad publicity, production delays, and rumors that have been flying around about the show since police accused him of staging a hate crime against himself.

TMZ reports that many of the show’s cast members are fed up with Smollett, and feel betrayed by him, and some even want him to be fired, feeling that if the network doesn’t give him the boot, then he should simply quit on his own due the spectacle he’s caused.

According to a source, Smollett’s Empire salary is significantly higher than initial reports of $65,000 an episode, and that all the actors got significant raises early when the show became a big hit. If Smollett was unhappy about his salary, it was not well known and to the source’s knowledge, he did not voice any complaints about his salary on Empire.

Smollett has maintained he was a victim and had no part in the alleged attack.

Roberts spoke to Smollett on February 14 in his only interview about the incident. She discussed her feelings on the matter on Thursday’s Good Morning America.

“This touches all the buttons. It’s a setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters. I cannot think of another case where there is this anger on so many sides and you can understand why there would be,” Roberts said.

Roberts also explained how the interview figured into the timing of events.

“At that time, on Tuesday, police officers were saying that his account was consistent, it was credible, and that he was being cooperative. Now this was all before the interview aired on Thursday, and then we found out about the brothers.”

CBS News reported on Saturday that Abel and Ola Osundairo claimed to police that Smollett knew them and alleged that the actor “paid them to participate in the alleged attack.” The two are brothers from Nigeria, who were arrested the week prior and released without charges. According to the brothers’ attorney, Ola was an extra on Season 2 of Empire, and Abel was Smollett’s personal trainer.

Smollett was taken into custody Thursday morning and faces a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report. Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, released a statement to ET.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.”

ABC News chief legal affairs anchor Dan Abrams told Roberts on Thursday that her interview with Smollett will likely be important evidence in the case going forward."

The Fox show's executive co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong released a joint statement with their executive producers on Friday (February 22) to announce that they would ""remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season"", effectively suspending Jussie while his case goes on.

Now though, TVLine reports that Daniels is backing an ambitious plan to recast the character of Jamal Lyon for future seasons so the character wouldn't have to be killed off. This option is apparently being actively considered by producers, but no decision has been made just yet.

Daniels's representative declined to comment on this latest news, as did a spokesperson for Empire.

Smollett was arrested and charged on Thursday by the Chicago district attorney's office with filing a false police report, following accusations that he staged a hate crime and falsely claimed to be a victim of a homophobic and racist attack. He denies these claims.

Smollett was released from jail on Thursday (February 21) after posting bond.

His lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson have said that they intend to mount a strong defence against the charge.

""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked,"" they said.

Empire returns to Fox in the US on Wednesday, March 13.

UC Berkeley Vice Chancellor Dan Mogulof did not name the suspect in a statement to the media but said “the suspect is not a student at or affiliate of the university.”

UCPD and the university administration thanked “the many members of the campus community who came forward with useful information.”

The university’s statement also claims the suspect in question is not a student or affiliate of the university. pic.twitter.com/LKqoiJmcx9 — Bradley Devlin (@bradleydevlin) February 22, 2019

UCPD and the university provided no further information about the potential suspect.

The UC Berkeley student who recorded the violent assault on campus Tuesday said on Fox News Friday morning that he was disappointed in the school’s “weak sauce” response to the attack.

During an interview on Fox and Friends, the student, Alexander Szarka, expressed his wish to see the suspect apprehended and prosecuted.

Szarka’s video, which went viral yesterday, shows a black-clad thug spewing obscenities and brutally assaulting Hayden Williams, a campus representative for Leadership Institute, who was manning Turning Point USA’s recruitment table. The man accused Williams of being a racist and “encouraging violence” before laying into him.

Szarka said that he noticed a verbal altercation at Williams’ table as he was walking through the area and saw it quickly escalate to a violent altercation. Some of the students reportedly objected to one of the signs at the table, which read “Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,” referring to the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax.

After the assailant flipped the table over, Sarka said he started to record.

“I was lucky enough to get the most egregious parts of the incident on camera,” he said. The attack left Williams with a black eye and a bloody nose.

“Fox and Friends” host Brian Kilmeade was incredulous that UCPD had still not been able to track down the suspect yet.

Szarka said he couldn’t weigh in on that but slammed the school’s chancellor’s “very weak sauce,” statement, calling it “a very blanket condemnation of violence” that didn’t go into any of the specifics. The student pointed out that a previous statement from Chancellor Carol Christ regarding a campus incident “was about three times longer” and went into much greater detail."

According to TMZ, Smollett divulged his alleged drug problem after turning himself in on Thursday morning on charges he filed a false police report involving the fake Jan. 29 hate crime. The admission raises questions about whether he might try to use alleged addiction as a defense of his actions.

The admission comes as Empire has shelved Smollett’s character for the rest of the season. Prosecutors said Abimbola Osundairo, one of the Nigerian brothers who allegedly helped Smollett stage the attack, was Smollett’s drug dealer, selling him Molly several times since the spring of 2018.

—Death of Tamla Horsford ruled accidental as her family demands answers—

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a press conference on Thursday that Smollett, 36, concocted the attack as a way to gain publicity and get a bigger salary. Smollett is said to make $65,000 per episode – which adds up to nearly $1.2 million for the season’s 18 episodes. Smollett has been with the show since it premiered in 2015.

“I’m left hanging my head and asking why,” Johnson said. “Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

—Keshia Knight Pulliam reacts to ex-husband Ed Hartwell marrying his alleged mistress—

In court documents, Smollett answered “no” to whether he had any mental or alcohol problems. Smollett was arrested and charged with filing a false police report — a felony in Illinois. Johnson said that Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500 using a personal check to stage the attack.

In claiming to have a drug problem, according to TMZ, Smollett could be paving the way to use it as a mitigating factor when it comes to potential sentencing."

But when Smollett talked to police on Jan. 29, he said he’d been attacked by two white men wearing masks. After 100 interviews and countless hours of investigation, police identified the two men, who told of being hired — by Smollett.

AD

If Smollett hoped to draw attention to himself, as Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson characterized the ruse, then Smollett accomplished his mission. Relatively not-famous before, he is now the infamous member of the “Empire” cast who is being written out of the show. He has been charged with disorderly conduct, which seems a mild offense in light of the resources and lost man-hours devoted to his case.

AD

Meanwhile: MAGA.

“Make America Great Again,” a campaign phrase used by Ronald Reagan that was later commandeered by Donald Trump, is increasingly perceived as a statement either of patriotic pride or racist malice, as nearly emotionally evocative as the Confederate battle flag is in some places. Thus, when Smollett allegedly used MAGA to fortify his tale of an attack, he was initially believed — at least by many in the pitchfork media — because it wasn’t totally unbelievable.

AD

Yet a more jaundiced eye might have been skeptical of a scenario in which two men would attack another man at 2 a.m. in subfreezing Chicago because he was black and gay — and in the name of President Trump. Then again, people have been acting strangely these days.

A woman recently attacked a man in Cape Cod, Mass., for wearing a MAGA hat in a Mexican restaurant. Last month, teen boys from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, who had come to Washington for the March for Life, were immediately condemned for what was initially reported as harassment of a Native American activist, but they were cleared of any wrongdoing by a third-party investigation. And, this week, a California high school student was banned from wearing her MAGA cap to school.

AD

On a far more serious note, the Coast Guard lieutenant and would-be terrorist arrested this week allegedly was mapping a plan to kill Democratic leaders and journalists. According to a court filing, Christopher Paul Hasson, 49, had been planning a killing campaign for at least two years, amassing an arsenal of weapons, including 15 firearms and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and contemplating a biological attack. He had studied other mass murderers, read their manifestos and compiled a list of “traitors” he allegedly intended to kill. Authorities say his motive was to “establish a white homeland” through “focused violence.”

AD

Because Hasson, a former skinhead, envisions a world of only white people — and given Trump’s attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity and religion — it doesn’t take much to imagine that he would vote for Trump over the Democrats he hoped to kill. What, if anything, would that mean? Not one thing, yet the president surely deserves some blame for contributing to the racist animus that percolates just beneath the surface in some pockets of civilized society.

Both Hasson and Smollett are 100 percent responsible for their own actions, full stop. But there’s a reason Smollett tossed a MAGA hat into his ring of conspiracy. There’s a reason Hasson, who reportedly never spoke of politics at work and seemed a dedicated military and Coast Guard service member, is presumed by some to be a Trump supporter.

AD

During the two years of the Trump presidency, MAGA has morphed in the public mind from a rah-rah rally chant to a nearly KKK-grade threat of white supremacy. This is obviously unfair to the millions who support, say, a conservative Supreme Court yet never racism or nativism, but this is where we are. The value of MAGA as a positive slogan is spent, except among a relatively small cadre of Trump loyalists who might as well be exchanging a secret handshake.

AD

As a symbol of rebellion, on the other hand, you might want to invest. It should come as no surprise that some kids love the hat because grown-ups are so upset about it.

There's at least one true thing Jussie Smollett said about his allegedly false hate crime report

This whole thing is way overblown. This guy try to scam us and now he's busted. And he has not set us back mightily (unless you let that be the case). He's one single person. So a few Democrats might have supported him before all the evidence came in, so what? They messed up, do you think they'll do it again? Now Republicans are using this to call into question the whole premise of the left and the Democratic Party. They are telling us (on this site) to stop watching MSM news because it's all lies and deceit. So we're supposed to look at Breitbart and Fox because they tell the truth?

The cons and Republicans are going to make a big issue of this as long as they can. Does the civilization of the Western World hang on this one scam? Don't we (Dems) have some real issues with the leadership of the Republican Party? They will try to keep it on the radar until 2020, I don't think it will work but they will try. Democrats shouldn't waste time by falling into their trap by pulling their hair out, explaining it all and trying to counter them with reason. If this incident was ""reversed"" they would have no compunction to defend themselves with every lie, piece of dis-information, insult and hate they could think of. They wouldn't buckle and give ""mea culpas"".

""Captain Marvel"" praised in strong first press reactions, so ignore those fake user reviews

I've learned to tune out the toxic fans. But, sadly, I'm also tuning out the critics. I think the ""The Last Jedi"" was franchise-cripplingly horrible. Yet there it stands with a rating among the critics of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience scored it 45%, and that wasn't just a handful of ""anti-SJW"" misogynists -- that's based on over 200,000 ratings.

Meanwhile, ""The Orville"" is the opposite. Although the critics have improved their opinions in season two, back in season one they had it at 20%, even as the audience gave it scores in the 90s.

I think of it as the Trumpification of criticism. Everything is culture-war politics these days. The critics tend to be liberal and can watch a horrifically bad movie and think it good if it's coming from the right place, politically -- a diverse cast, feminist themes, people of color and liberals-in-good-standing at the reins, etc. Then they can watch a good show and instinctively crap on it, if they detect a hint of reactionary politics -- or even just a persona non grata on the marquee.

The toxic fan-boys are even worse. They can hate a movie like Captain Marvel, or the new Ghostbusters, or a show like the latest season of Doctor Who without even seeing it, merely because they are reacting to the enthusiastic anticipation by the left. They perceive it as a product of the other tribe, and so they are dead set against it before they even have anything to go on. — Arkadia"

“Certainly, we’ve been inspired by real-life cases too,” Strong added, before detailing one that he truly became obsessed with while working on the show’s first season.

Producers for Empire announced early Friday (Feb. 22) that Jussie Smollett’s character Jamal Lyon would not appear in the final two episodes of the show after his cast mates made it clear that they want nothing to do with him after his arrest for lying to police about being attacked by racist, homophobic Trump supporters.

And now, reports suggest producers for the hit Fox series are considering bringing in a new actor to replace Smollett instead of simply writing his character out of the show.

According to TV Line, showrunner Lee Daniels—who loosely based the Jamal Lyon character on his own life—is a “strong proponent of the recast option.”

Fox said in a statement earlier today about Smollett’s Season 5 ousting: “The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our EMPIRE family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.

“We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of ‘Jamal’ from the final two episodes of the season.”

Fox added that Lee Daniels and his team of executive producers—including Danny Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo, and Dennis Hammer—all agreed that it would be best to remove Jussie from the Season 5 finale.

Smollett, who has played Jamal Lyon on the Fox drama since its debut four years ago in January 2015, was turned himself in to Chicago police Thursday after he was hit with a felony criminal charge of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report in connection to last month’s alleged hate crime attack.

Chicago police said in a press conference Thursday that Smollett paid two men, Nigerian brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo, to stage the attack because he was unhappy with his Empire salary.

After leaving Cook County jail Thursday on $100k bond, Smollett went straight to the Empire set and apologized to everyone, but maintained his innocence.

TMZ reported that Smollett changed his number “because certain pissed off cast members were blowing up his phone,” and he only gave his new number out to the people who still support him.

Not long after his arrest Thursday, the actor’s legal team released a statement saying: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election.

“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”"

The outspoken Barkley made his comments on TNT during the halftime of the Rockets-Lakers game.

“Two black guys beating a black guy up,” Barkley said. “Just thinking aloud.”

Shaquille O’Neal chimed in: “I can’t believe you, Chuck.”

Barkley wasn’t done.

“America, let me just tell you something,” he said. “Do not commit crimes with cheques. If you’re gonna break the law, do not write a cheque…Get cash, man. I never use the ATM. Now, I heard you can only get $200…Gonna make a lot of stops at the ATM…Do not write checks when you commit illegal activity.”

He was referring to Smollett allegedly writing two bodybuilding brothers a $3,500 cheque to pay for their role in the staged attack.

And he had some advice for Smollett.

“Jussie, you wasted all that damn time and money. You know what you shoulda’ did? Just went up to Liam Neeson’s neighbourhood. You coulda’ solved all your damn problems.”

All kidding aside, Smollett’s career trajectory is no joke.

Producers of Empire announced Friday that the troubled actor will be removed from the final two episodes of the season.

The axing comes in the wake of his arrest in Chicago for allegedly staging a racist, anti-gay attack.

The 36-year-old star faces charges of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report.

“While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays,” Empire’s executive producers said in a written statement.

”We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season.“

Smollett, who is black and gay, plays a gay character on the show that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.

According to cops, Smollett allegedly staged the hoax attack because he wanted more money from the show — he currently earns $100,000 per episode — and to give his career a boost.

In addition, they said he earlier sent a threatening letter to himself at the Windy City studio where the drama is shot.

His legal team predictably called Smollett a “man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence.”
