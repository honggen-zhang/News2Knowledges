“[He was] always respectful of his elders, always inviting and cool with people that he knew or people he didn’t know,” Wilson’s aunt, Shronda Parsons, told the Sun-Times.

Given Wilson’s easygoing personality, his family was shocked to hear that he had been shot in the chest on Feb. 1 at his apartment in the South Shore neighborhood. Shortly after being rushed to the University of Chicago Medical Center, the 31-year-old was pronounced dead, according to Chicago police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Since the medical examiner’s office informed Wilson’s family of his death, they’ve struggled to get in touch with the detectives who are investigating the slaying, she said.

Parsons is getting the sense that the family is being stonewalled, and noted they still don’t know fundamental details about the case, like who called 911.

“[The detectives] couldn’t reach out and try to come over to my sister’s house and say, ‘Hey, we understand what’s going on, sorry for your loss, we’re working the case,’” she asked.

“If you could just tell us you’re working the case, it would feel better than nothing,” said Parsons, a case worker for the Illinois Department of Human Services.

She said it was disheartening to see how many detectives are investigating the reported attack on “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. Police initially assigned over a dozen detectives to look into the Smollett case.

“I was kind of frustrated,” she said. “Like, wow, it takes 20 detectives to work on this one case for this actor but you have multiple people who are losing family members every day. And if they’re going through what our family is going through, that’s pretty sad that one person, out of those 20 people that are working around the clock, couldn’t contact us.”

Just after 1 a.m., witnesses heard someone come to the back door of Wilson’s apartment in the 1800 block of East 78th Street, police said. After firing a single shot, the suspect ran off.

Despite the mysterious circumstances of his death, Parsons claimed the family has some information that could be useful to investigators.

Wilson was hanging out at another aunt’s house Thursday evening and was picked up by two people, according to Parsons. Before he left, the aunt noticed that he was video chatting with a man with dreadlocks and a “tattoo on his face,” she said.

“It was a person that we’ve never seen before,” she said, noting that the aunt reported those details to investigators and suggested they interview the possible suspects.

Parsons said Wilson was “never a person to start trouble.” However, Cook County court records show that he had been arrested 10 times and convicted of a series of misdemeanors, including convictions for unlawful use of a weapon in 2010 and battery last year.

Nevertheless, Parsons described Wilson as a hard-working “jokester.” He graduated from Roberto Clemente Community Academy with honors, and had recently been working on a food truck and cooking at a Five Guys restaurant in the Loop, she said.

Parsons said the family is now planning Wilson’s funeral, but she wouldn’t release details about the service because “the killer is still on the street.”

A Chicago police spokesman didn’t respond to a request for additional information about Wilson’s death."

In the novel, the all-powerful State was the sole arbiter of reality, even to the stunning degree that cold, hard facts relating to just about anything could be summarily denied. If the State said that two plus two equals five, then two plus two became five.

Sadly, this is what we are seeing develop in the Western world at present, even more insidiously than in Orwell's time, when this writer and many of his generation feared the encroachment of such a system. Today, the political left is crafting ""truth"" out of abject falsehoods, and the more people who buy into it, all the better as regards the left's objectives.

It's become clear that the left is determined to tag President Donald Trump with the ""racist"" brand until it sticks, despite there being as much evidence for him being a racist as there is that he's a 4-year-old girl.

Earlier in his presidency, the left tried to convict Trump in the court of public opinion concerning allegations that he was an abusive misogynist. They weren't able to do this, despite the fact that he's been in the public eye for decades and has employed literally thousands of people, many of whom were women.

Trump's detractors weren't able to prove that he's some sort of sexual deviant either. This they attempted with almost as much determination as they did vis-à-vis their accusations of misogyny, handily ignoring the incongruity of their support for sexual deviance in all its forms in most other instances.

The charges of racism against Trump have enjoyed a much longer life, however, probably owing to such accusations being more potentially damaging. The vigor with which the left is fanning the flames of racial tension is very much in keeping with the wholesale sabotage of race relations that began during Barack Obama's presidency. Turn on any news show, or read anything emanating from the establishment press concerning race relations and Trump's alleged racial bigotry suddenly becomes front and center.

On last Sunday's installment of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, was asked by host Chuck Todd about the ongoing controversy over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook photo featuring people in blackface and Klan robe.

Brown responded in utter weasel fashion, declaring that ""[W]e have a president who's a racist,"" and then went on to spout a bunch of wholly irrelevant leftist dog-whistle phraseology. Brown also offered a preposterous analysis of the Trump family's business practices, claiming that these have been inherently racist for decades.

On Jan 29, Jussie Smollett, a young up-and-coming black singer and actor, was allegedly assaulted in Chicago by two white men. According to Smollett, the assailants yelled racial and homophobic slurs (Smollett self-identifies as homosexual), beat him, poured some chemical substance on him and tied a rope around Smollett's neck. The entertainer said in an interview following the attack that his alleged attackers yelled, ""This is MAGA country!"" during the assault.

Within hours, leftists came out of the woodwork to condemn the attack and to exploit it as evidence of an emergent culture of intolerance, which, whether they articulated explicitly or not, is obviously a top-down effect of our Racist-in-Chief's well-known bigotry. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and other prominent uber-libs weighed in, calling the attack on Smollett ""an attempted modern-day lynching.""

The ever-intrepid Smollett made a triumphant return to the stage in Los Angeles last Saturday, announcing to a nightclub crowd that ""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I can't let the motherf--kers win.""

Here, I am inclined to ask precisely who these ""motherf--kers"" are in Smollett's view. His attackers? Bigots in general? Is it more likely that Smollett's sympathies lie with those who came out to support him following the attack (excluding the president, who condemned the assault)? Those who have mercilessly excoriated Trump over the last two years have not been shy about extending their condemnation to all Trump supporters, which obviously encompasses at least half the electorate.

In the end, it doesn't matter if it is never proved that Smollett was assaulted by Trump supporters. In fact, it would be better for the left if the case were never resolved; that way, they can offer up any narrative they like. To those on the left, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown having been murdered by racist white police officers is truth. From the moment the assault on Smollett became known, the left seized upon white racist Trump supporters as having carried it out, and this will undoubtedly continue.

What's most disturbing about all this vitriol and wholesale demonization is that when you have large political factions (as opposed to small ones) squaring off in this manner, there is a markedly increased potential for things escalating, even into widespread civil unrest – or worse."

Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier said that the new Fox Corporation will be “more nimble” and getting a “rare business opportunity” to rethink what it means to be a broadcast network once the sale of other 21st Century Fox assets to Disney is completed.

“Weâre all eagerly awaiting our companyâs new Day One,” said Collier at the Television Critics Association winter press tour Wednesday. The former AMC/SundanceTV programming chief took on the new role in November overseeing Fox Broadcasting and the companyâs live, scripted and unscripted entertainment programming strategy.

He touted New Foxâs flexibility in deal-making, and indicated that it plans to work with independent studios not aligned with a Big Four network, such as Sony Pictures TV and Warner Bros. He called the ability to play the field “a real powerful tool in our arsenal” at a time when the rest of the industry is highly vertically integrated and networks are focused on keeping productions in house.

“I think we’re going to have capabilities without a lot of the overhead that you saw before,” Collier said on stage, nodding to the potential to enhance Foxâs physical production capabilities down the road.

Collier also announced the formation of SideCar, a content development accelerator headed by Jackal Group chairman and CEO Gail Berman, which will be committed to finding and incubating content.

Separately, when asked if there was friction with the creative community because of Foxâs association with Fox News, Collier sidestepped the issue. He said he understood why it was a heated issue for many people — given the perception in Hollywood that Fox News is often a cheerleader for the Trump administration. Collier said he “found (himself) looking across the aisle,” and the bottom line is that the news and entertainment divisions are run completely separately.

Collier also discussed:

Ryan Murphy: “Any time Ryan Murphy wants to build something, we take it very seriously,” he said, but said there are no plans to revive Murphyâs Fox series “Scream Queens,” as was recently floated on Twitter. Wrestling: Fox Broadcastingâs cable sibling Fox Sports 1 and other networks will have “some” other wrestling under Foxâs new deal with WWE. But the “Smackdown” and “Raw” franchises will be reserved for the broadcast net. “Rent.” Collier said it would have been “impractical” to have understudies for the entire cast of the Jan. 31 telecast that was hampered when star Brennin Hunt broke his foot at the dress rehearsal the night before the live telecast. “Rent” was a commercial flop for the network, drawing just over 3 million viewers. Collier nonetheless asserted that Fox “had so much to be proud of” and “executed beautifully.”

Not one to drink Kool-Aid (or anything) without asking lots of questions, Joe Budden explained to the crew of Revolt’s State Of The Culture during the February 4 episode why he thinks the attack did take place — just not the way Smollett tells it.

Calling it bizarre that — among other things — Smollett would leave a noose around his neck for 45 minutes after the attack, Budden remarked “Everything about this looks funny.

“I’m not saying he wasn’t attacked,” he quickly clarified, “he was certainly attacked … I want to make sure that I’m not being as insensitive as I’m known to be because he [definitely] got his ass beat. But, niggas get they ass beat all the time.”

Citing a Reddit theory that rather than heading to local Subway at 2 a.m., Smollett had been at a gay club with a man already in a relationship — and that the man’s boyfriend and a friend followed and attacked him that night — Joe suggested that the story we’ve heard was perhaps a spin of sorts.

“When bad things happen [to famous people] and they want to cover the story (because famous rich people do fuck shit), you cover the story so you can protect your image, your likeness, and your career,” Budden noted, at one point calling it record industry bullshit 101.

“I don’t know if we feel the same way if we find out it’s a regular crime,“ he said. “I’m waiting for footage. Just show me the footage and I’ll shut the fuck up.”

Meanwhile, Smollett — back in Chicago on the set of Empire — is being sought by detectives to chat about the incident. According to TMZ sources, police have not found any video of either the attack itself or anyone fleeing the scene.

Smollett was attacked on January 29 by two assailants allegedly wearing MAGA hats, who broke his ribs, put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and called him a bevy of slurs names. It is currently being investigated as a hate crime."

The actor was the target of a homophobic and racist attack in Chicago last week.

“First of all, on any situation like that, the first thing I’ll say is that my heart goes out to Jussie and everyone involved. It really is a tragic thing,” Collier said. “He’s an important and so talented member of the Fox family, and our heart goes out to him.”

“There is an ongoing criminal investigation, so I won’t go deeper than that, except to say it’s been really gratifying to watch the creative community rally around him,” he continued, adding that at this time, Fox is not announcing whether “Empire” has been renewed for another season.

ET learned on Wednesday that Smollett was back to work on the “Empire” set this week. Security has been present and is of importance to everyone. ET has also learned that Smollett is healing well.

The 35-year-old actor and musician appeared onstage for his planned set at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California, on Saturday night, where he clarified details of his attack.

“There’s a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that is absolutely not true,” Smollett said. “I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked. They were not broken.”

“I went to the doctor immediately. Frank Gatson drove me, I was not hospitalized,” he added. “Both my doctors in L.A. and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously.”

“And above all I fought the f**k back,” he concluded.

As previously reported, a source told ET that Smollett was walking around Chicago early last Tuesday morning when two men started yelling racial and homophobic slurs at him, before repeatedly hitting him. The men then poured a substance on him (believed to be bleach), according to the source, and one of the attackers put a rope around his neck. Smollett was then taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Police tweeted photos of two persons of interest in the attack last week, asking for the public’s help in identifying them. See more on the incident in the video below.

Up until that point many of us assumed that Savage, whose real name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was African-American. But once it was reported that he was actually a British citizen who has overstayed his visa, Black Twitter wasted no time turning the situation into a barrage of clever memes poking fun at the Brit who was secretly living in their midst.

For the most part, immigration tends to be a topic that the Black community has precarious views on with many Black people born in this country taking the stance that they have their own problems to deal with and can’t be bothered fighting for immigrant rights as well. Which is why when political commentator Angela Rye, made the statement that, “Black folks are immigrants too,” during a January 11th segment of The Breakfast Club, it isn’t surprising that she received a lot of pushback from those begging to differ.

The truth of the matter is, as a collective, most Americans treat immigration as a “brown” issue. When folks hear stories about ICE deportations it often conjures up images of someone being sent back to Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras or some other Central American nation. While it is true that nearly half of all deportations are indeed targeted towards these communities, sometimes what you guys would call “regular Black folks” get targeted too.

It’s a shame that it took 21 Savage’s plight to drive this point home for so many people, and as a fellow immigrant myself, I would be remiss not to admit that the news of his detainment triggered some old feelings of fear and trauma.

Immigration is the new Terrorism

While civil rights violations are something that all people of color in this country face, immigration is an extra layer of terror that many of us have grapple with on a daily basis. Unless you’ve personally been through it, I can’t even begin to explain how swift and brutal the process of legal residency or even citizenship can be.

There are people who have unceremoniously been yanked up by ICE at the beginning of the week, ripped from their families and “sent back” by the end of it. At first, I assumed that would be 21 Savage’s fate and rightfully so, that is UNTIL I found out that Black Lives Matter had gotten involved and was claiming this was an incident of racial bias and discrimination.

My first reaction to this stance was, ‘Ok that’s cool…ya’ll want to help a brother out, but if he was living here illegally as a felon, and had the nerve to be a celebrity on top of that, well this is pretty much an open and shut case.’

Turns out I was wrong. Not only is this situation not as Black and white as the media headlines would have us all think, the more you look into it (which I did), the more obvious it becomes that this legitimately is a case of racial profiling and systemic oppression at the peak of it’s audacity.

Let’s start first with the facts….

Do The Right Thing

Usually when politicians, particularly conservatives, speak about immigration they stress that those seeking a home on U.S soil need to be reasonable and “fill out the proper paperwork.” What is perhaps the most ironic part of this case is doing things the right way, is what put 21 Savage on the government’s radar.

In 2017, the rapper wanted to finally be seen as a U.S resident and contacted his legal team to start the process. Normally people who have been living illegally in the United states for 10 years or longer, but have a qualifying U.S. relative living here, are granted a U-Visa. Given that Savage has three American-born children who he takes care of financially, he is clearly eligible under those guidelines.

I can already hear some of you saying, ‘But Blue, he’s a felon, so doesn’t that mean all that goes out the window?’

Not exactly.

In 2014, Savage pled guilty to felony drug charges, but had his record expunged in 2018. For those who aren’t clear what that means, expungement is a court-ordered process in which the legal record of an arrest or a criminal conviction is “sealed,” or erased in the eyes of the law. The whole point of getting a conviction expunged is to set aside a criminal conviction. In this case, that was done to ensure that this young man could get all the “proper documentation” immigration alarmists are always demanding.

ALSO…can I just please point out that 21 Savage is only 26? That means he was a minor when he first arrived in the United States in 2005 and is now being punished for the actions of the adults responsible for him. DACA was implemented to prevent this very thing from happening.

FREE 21 SAVAGE! pic.twitter.com/2ggdhQYxxS — RICH THE KID (@richthekid) February 6, 2019

“As a minor, [Savage]’s family overstayed their work visas, and he, like almost two million other children, was left without legal status through no fault of his own,” explains his attorney Charles H. Kuck.

“This is a civil law violation, and the continued detention of Mr. Abraham-Joseph serves no other purpose than to unnecessarily punish him and try to intimidate him into giving up his right to fight to remain in the United States.”

READ MORE: Jussie Smollett was reluctant to report his brutal attack to Chicago police, report says

Now, you’re probably wondering, if this is all the result of his adult guardians not filing the proper paperwork, and he hired a legal team to make things right when he had the funds (because trust me – this is a VERY expensive undertaking), then why is he being detained and threatened with deportation?

Because, racism.

Cold as I.C.E

ICE, who is now working under the regime of the Trump administration, has decided to ignore the paperwork expunging his record, and nullify his blatant eligibility for a U-Visa.

“The Department of Homeland Security has known his address and his history since his filing for the U Visa in 2017, yet they took no action against him until this past weekend,” points out Kuck.

This is not an unfortunate case of one official looking over Savage’s record and using his/her discretion to determine he’s a poor candidate for relief. The legal breadcrumbs tell a much more sinister story.

READ MORE: Here’s why Stacey Abrams delivering the Dems’ State of the Union response is so historic

ICE has a track record of disproportionately targeting people of color. These deportations have nothing to do with fighting crime or keeping our streets safe because only 5 percent of new removal filings were based on aggravated felony charges, and a meager 1.3 percent were on the basis of possible terrorist ties, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) under the Freedom of Information Act. The rest of the people being targeted are just regular people contributing to our economy.

“Before the Trump administration, courts would sometimes take into consideration factors and decide to not deport certain people,” explains Luis Mancheno, a New York-based immigration attorney explained to CBS News last November.

Having ties to the community, owning property and being connected to family members already in the U.S., have always been reasons for a judge to choose not to deport someone. In fact, those are some of the very reasons I got to stay in this country, while I gathered the funds to pay my own astronomical legal fees to become a U.S. citizen.

But now, ICE has taken up the mantra of “arrest everyone brown first and check paperwork later,” which has prompted numerous immigration and civil rights lawyers to file lawsuits about what amounts to a clear miscarriage of justice.

This isn’t just an issue in border states either. In Pennsylvania they had to create new police guidelines, because officials were pulling over random cars and demanding people of color show their passports. The ACLU has even set up a page on their site to explain what to do if you are stopped by ICE.

21 Savage’s detainment is just the tip of the iceberg.

So if ya’ll need to laugh at a few Twitter memes to blow off some steam, that’s fine, our people have laughed to keep from crying for generations. But after all the “LOL’s” subside, please be clear that overzealous immigration attacks are basically just a more clever iteration of the same racial profiling thats African Americans have had to endure for generations.

Looks like some of ya’ll owe Angela Rye an apology because it turns out immigration IS a Black issue after all.

Yesterday, Chicago writer Emily Zanotti claimed that the Chicago Police Department has subpoenaed Jussie Smollett’s phone records.

The tweet came after the two men who were seen on the surveillance video are determined to be homeless and having no connection to Smollett.

Later, Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel quoted the Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett will be held accountable if they find he was lying about the attack and made a false report.

At this point, with few leads about the people who attacked him, the Chicago police claim that they are trying to match the rope around Smollett’s neck to other surveillance video to see if they can determine where it was purchased.

Ok, great.

Personally, the suggestion that Smollett might have been faking his assault is problematic at this stage. By law, anyone who files a false police report will be held accountable. So it’s strange that they would put this idea out into the world.

Just keep investigating until all possibilities have been exhausted.

I can’t for the life of me think of a reason why Smollett would lie about such a thing and then involve the police. And until it is absolutely proven that he did, the suggestion shouldn’t be thrown out there.

See what a few people have to say about all of this on the following pages, including a thread of the police department’s inconsistencies from activist DeRay McKesson."

State of which union? These are the questions Billy Porter laid to rest when he delivered the official LGBTQ State of The Union address. The acclaimed theater actor, who has stolen television hearts with roles in FX original series Pose and American Horror Story: Apocalypse, addressed our (gender)queer country with remarkable grace. Trump could never.

The seven-minute video from Logo touched a number of topics, directly impacting the LGBTQ community in the United States and abroad. With poise and passion, Porter addressed the rise in trans/homophobic violence, including the recent attack on Jussie Smollett, whom he referred to as ""our brother."" Porter also referenced the U.S. military transgender ban and the violent, institutionalized policing of queer people in places like Brazil.

Porter's speech was not all sadness and despair. He acknowledged recently elected officials who are openly gay, plugged the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots and the world Pride celebration that NYC will host to commemorate it, and heralded the wave of LGBTQ representation spreading across film, music, and television (an expansion he has, no doubt, played parts in).

""Love will and love must keep us united. Only with the strength from love can we continue to forge ahead,"" he urged. ""Make no mistake, our best days are ahead of us."" I receive this. The only thing that could have made this video better was a collective of drag queens and other femmes dressed in white behind him."

Smollett told police that on Jan. 29, two men who seemed to know who he was beat him, shouted racial and homophobic slurs and looped a rope around his neck during an early-morning attack in Chicago, according to a recently released police report.

""Empire"" executive producers Brett Mahoney praised Smollett, who is back at work on the Chicago-based drama, and condemned his attackers during a panel featuring producers from Fox dramas.

“The attack on Jussie, because he is such a beloved member of our family, hurt us all very hard. Jussie is a proud, gay black man,"" he said. ""I don’t know whether the cowards who attacked him were trying to beat the gay, the black or the pride out of him, but that’s impossible, because he’s strong. And so we’re happy that he is back at work.""

Earlier in the day, Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier offered his sentiments.

“My heart goes out to Jussie and everyone involved. It really is just a tragic thing,"" he said, responding to the first question during his inaugural executive session as Fox program chief.

Collier went on to praise Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the fifth-season family drama, but did not comment on the investigation by Chicago police.

As for a related question regarding the potential renewal of ""Empire"" going forward, Collier was mum: ""We don't have pickups to announce.""

Smollett took the stage Saturday for the first time since the attack, performing at a concert in Los Angeles.

""Empire"" executive producer Danny Strong pointed to Smollett's concert appearance and statement as evidence of his spirit and class.

“Anything you want to know about Jussie, you could see from his statement when he performed on Saturday night, which was a statement of defiance for what happened to him and then a statement of love,"" Strong said.

""He’s truly a very special person, which is how he got cast as Jamal, because we needed someone special to play that part and it was him. So, I’m not surprised at all by the class and the poise of his response to what happened.”

SGA will also fund 100 percent of the travel costs for the group’s adviser, who is required to chaperone the trip.

It is reported by ABC7 Chicago that there is more evidence surrounding the January 29 incident that led Smollett to take himself to the hospital.

Smollett made his first public appearance since the attack on Saturday when he performed for a sold-out show at Troubador in Los Angeles. The show was supposed to be a meet-and-greet, but this aspect was canceled due to concerns about the artist’s safety. During his set, Smollett addressed the attack to his fans.

“There are so many words on my heart that I want to say,” he said. “The most important that I can say, to keep it simple, thank you so much. I’m okay… I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. I’m going to stand strong with y’all.”

Smollett told police that he was walking alone from a Subway restaurant at 2 a.m. when the attack took place. He said the two men that attacked him were wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. New details from the Chicago Police Department have surfaced stating responding officers found Smollett at his home with stained clothing and white rope around his neck, ABC7 Chicago reports. Surveillance footage from the night of the attack has been released, though it doesn’t show the alleged suspects. Police have also released a photo of two people who have been identified as potential persons of interest.

They are reportedly searching for the two possible suspects, and left their contact information in the article for those who know where to find them.

The Chicago Police Department previously confirmed in a statement that Smollett’s attack was racially-charged assault and battery, based off of the evidence they found while working on the case.

“Two unknown offenders approached him and gained his attention by yelling out racial and homophobic slurs towards him,” an officer said in a statement.

Smollett has historically been vocal about topics regarding equality among people in the LGBTQIA community, as well as on topics of racial equality. Though he has yet to speak on the horrific incident on his social media accounts, he is still receiving support from celebrities and fans.

Taraji P. Henson, who plays Smollett’s mother on Empire, appeared on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Monday and said that he is “resilient.” The show shared the video with Henson on its Facebook page.

New episodes of Empire will return on Fox on March 28."

On Wednesday, Fox's day at the Television Critics Association 2019 winter press tour, the animated series was renewed for 31st and 32nd seasons which will take the series to 713 episodes. This also makes The Simpsons the longest-running primetime scripted show in television history. “Woo hoo! 32 Seasons! Watch your back, ‘Meet the Press,” said Homer Simpson.

Besides that news, CEO Fox Entertainment Charlie Collier stepped out wearing the head of the Hippo from the Fox hit The Masked Singer....but when the mask was removed, in line with the masked singing competition series, it wasn't Collier after all! Instead, it was actor Jonathan Banks (Better Call Saul, which airs on Collier's prior network job, AMC).

In his first executive session since joining Fox in November, Collier says they're waiting for the close of the Disney transaction so they can get to ""Day One"" of what the network will be moving forward as ""Fox Entertainment,"" ditching what was being called ""New Fox"" by the former regime.

On the brutal attack on Empire star Jussie Smollett last week in Chicago, Collier said, ""He's an important and so talented member of the Fox family... it's been really gratifying to see the creative community rally around him."" Collier added that he didn't have an answer about a renewal for Empire yet.

In being asked about last month's Rent live performance, which had low ratings and, due to the injury of actor Brennin Hunt, wasn't completely live, Collier said. ""I think it would've been impractical to have understudies for the entire cast,"" he said. ""I'm really proud of what we accomplished and what the audiences got to enjoy.""

Asked about the future of Damon Wayans on Lethal Weapon (after Wayans said he was quitting the crime drama last October) Collier didn't have anything to announce in terms of the actor's future with the show or whether the show would return for a fourth season.

Is Scream Queens coming back to Fox, since Ryan Murphy recently posted on Instagram about a possible return? Collier said there are no plans to bring the horror series back. He also said he didn't have news about a new iteration of 24."

While Collier and Fox won’t say anything official, we hear talks regarding more of the series toplined by Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson are actually quite far along.

Smollett, who plays openly gay Jamal Lyon on the Fox drama, had just returned last Tuesday from New York to Chicago where Empire is shot. He was reportedly on the street near his apartment at around 2 AM when two men began hurling derogatory slurs at him. The two then attacked Smollett, hitting him repeatedly and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him now thought to have been bleach. The attackers reportedly also put a rope around Smollett’s neck before fleeing the scene.

After reporting the incident to police and conducting an initial interview with them, Smollett drove to Northwestern Hospital to be seen by doctors. Bruised but not admitted, the performer returned home under increased security later that morning and was said to be in good condition, police said.

Chicago police said quickly they were treating the matter as a “possible hate crime.” On January 31, one day after local law enforcement released photos of “persons of interest” in the matter, Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi called the incident an “assault and battery case.”

On the day of the attack, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment

said in a statement that they were “deeply saddened and outraged” by the assault.

At a long-scheduled and SRO gig at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday, Smollett addressed the incident himself from the stage. As the Chicago police and FBI assisted investigation continued back in the Windy City, the performer told the packed crowd that “I had to be here tonight!”

Clearly moved by the turnout and reception of support, Smollett added to cheers in the legendary venue that “I couldn’t let those motherf*ckers win!”

Yesterday, the Chicago PD offered an update on the case via social media:

Collier’s executive session in Pasadena this morning followed a Prince soundtracked greatest hits video of Fox’s current programming with its mix of NFL, MLB, drama, unscripted, upcoming WWE, comedy and animation fare.

Noting that the “Disney transaction is yet to close,” Collier’s subsequent entrance appeared to mirror a segment of The Masked Singer with a hooded exec onstage. But of course it wasn’t the former AMC boss but Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul alum Jonathan Banks, who proceeded to introduce Collier who pushed the “Let’s Go Crazy” theme.

Pumping the optimism on what he called a “start-up company,” Collier noted it seems crazy “to scale down when everyone else is scaling up.”

Killing the first third of the 45-minute exec session with an inaugural address of sorts, seasoned pitchman Collier plugged the small is beautiful logline of New Fox and that the now NFL-fueled outlet was the only broadcast net to grow this season. Taking that ball over the line, to continue the gridiron connection, Collier made no small point of noting that Fox has Super Bowl LIV in 2020 out of Miami Gardens.

“I can assure you that the Murdochs and this management team are as curious as ever,” he assured the assembled media of the big bosses and the flexible strategy the new network plans to employ."

File Photo by Pete Marovich/UPI | License Photo

Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring on Wednesday apologized for wearing blackface to attend a college party in 1980, becoming the third elected official from the state to be embroiled in scandal in less than a week.

Herring revealed he darkened his skin to dress as a rapper when he was an undergraduate student.

""In 1980, when I was a 19-year-old undergraduate in college, some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song. It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes -- and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others -- we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup,"" Herring said in a lengthy statement posted to social media.

Herring said he has ""deep regret"" for his actions and realized it has caused pain for others.

""That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others,"" he said. ""It was really a minimization of both people of color, and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.""

The admission came less than a week after a conservative website, Big League Politics, posted an image of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 yearbook showing a photo of two unidentifiable people dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes and blackface.

The photo appeared on a yearbook page apparently dedicated entirely to Northam, who admitted he was in the photo Friday before doing an about-face Saturday and denying he was in the picture. He said he did darken his skin, though, when he attended a party dressed as Michael Jackson.

Northam has faced dozens of calls for his resignation from both Republicans and Democrats, including from Herring.

Herring met Wednesday morning with members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, which said it plans to release a full statement. The group spoke out against Northam on Friday, calling the photo ""disgusting, reprehensible and offensive.""

Should Northam resign, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax would lead the state, but this week he faced his own scandal after a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2004 at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. He denied the allegation and said he had a ""consensual encounter"" with the accuser, Vanessa Tyson.

RELATED Japan court issues fine for hate speech targeting ethnic Korean

""While this allegation has been both surprising and hurtful, I also recognize that no one makes charges of this kind lightly, and I take it and this situation very seriously,"" he said in a statement released Wednesday.

Tyson released a statement Wednesday through Washington, D.C., law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, offering details of the alleged assault. She said she wanted to ""set the record straight"" and accused Fairfax of branding her as a liar.

She said that ""what began as consensual kissing quickly turned into sexual assault,"" adding that Fairfax allegedly forced her to perform a sexual act on him.

Sam Lloyd, best known for playing Ted Buckland on Scrubs, has been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Tim Hobert, an executive producer on Scrubs, created a GoFundMe account for Lloyd this week, sharing the news that the actor received his diagnosis on Jan. 15.

“By all accounts, 2019 was off to a roaring start for our dear friend, Sam Lloyd. He and his wife, Vanessa, had recently welcomed their first child, a beautiful baby boy named Weston to the world,” the page reads.

The description continues: “The musical that Sam had been working on for over a decade had just been accepted into a prestigious theatre accelerator program. There was so much to be grateful for… Midway through January, Sam began to experience headaches and he had lost 10 pounds. He figured the headaches were caused by the lack of sleep that came along with his new role as Daddy, and the weight loss seemed like it could easily be the byproduct of a busy schedule.”

Lloyd went to see his doctor on Jan. 17 “as his headaches grew stronger” and the doctor “ordered a CT Scan.”

“The scan revealed a mass on Sam’s brain. Within a day, he was in brain surgery. Unfortunately, the tumour was too intertwined so the surgeons couldn’t remove it. By Sunday, Sam and Vanessa were informed that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Further scans showed the cancer was also in his liver, spine, and jaw,” the page reads.

“As Sam and Vanessa face the challenges ahead, they will both have to put working on hold,” Hobert wrote in the campaign description. “There will be a range of medical, childcare, and other expenses. We are asking for your help so our dear Sammy can use the time ahead to GET HEALTHY, spend time with his wife, his new son, and his wonderful friends.”

Hobert mentioned that Lloyd has not lost his sense of humour.

“Just hours after being diagnosed, Sam was cheering on his beloved New England Patriots in his hospital room,” Hobert shared on the GoFundMe page. ” When the nurse asked him to ‘cheer quieter,’ Sam politely nodded. When the nurse left the room, Sam turned to Vanessa and his friends and said, ‘What are they gonna do? Kill me?’

Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence tweeted a link to the GoFundMe page on Tuesday.

“This is Sam,” he wrote. “He was Ted on SCRUBS. He’s a pal. Just had his first baby. Get involved if you can. I am.”

Investigators continue to gather evidence in the hunt for his masked assailants.

In the mean time, Jussie has returned to work -- and Chicago PD hopes to do a follow-up while he's in town.

As we reported over the weekend, Jussie performed in Los Angeles.

He has remained adamant that the ""motherf--kers"" do not win. That's a great attitude in the face of true horror.

But he's also being careful. The planned meet-and-greet was canceled over security concerns.

TMZ reports that the actor returned to Chicago on Sunday to continue filming for Empire.

On Monday, he shot scenes for one of the final episodes of the season.

On Tuesday, Jussie did a table read with the cast.

In line with statements from showrunners and from Fox, security personnel were present the entire time.

TMZ's sources say that, while Jussie is in town, law enforcement officials are hoping to do a follow-up interview.

It's fairly standard for police to want to speak to victims of crimes more than once.

Though the first interview may be the most important, follow-ups may yield new information if the victim recalls something.

(That first night of sleep after a traumatic event can help people process their memories)

But police are not just relying on Jussie recollection of his attack -- which took place at night, at the hands of men wearing ski masks.

On Monday, Chicago police revealed obtained additional surveillance video.

Though the public has already seen this distant photo of the suspects, the hope is that additional CCTV footage will yield further clues.

Unfortunately, TMZ's sources say that police have yet to find video of two key things that police hope to see.

One, they have not found video of the attack.

Such video would be useful at trial, and would also help to silence the conspiracy theorists who believe that Jussie fabricated his own attack.

Two, police have not uncovered footage of anyone fleeing after the attack.

That would help them to track down at least the direction in which the pair of men traveled to escape.

Jussie was not attacked because he is a famous black man or an openly gay man.

He was targeted for this attack because he is both.

As we mentioned on the day of the vicious attack, Jussie had two targets on his back.

As an actor, he is able to provide much needed representation in the world of television, where gay roles so often go to white men.

Unfortunately, that is also what made him such a ""threat"" to the pair of hateful bigots who attacked him.

We hope that these monsters can be brought to justice, and swiftly.

Though it has been a week without any arrests, we need to remember that investigations take time.

A pair of masked men, men who may have picked their target in advance and who may have known where cameras were not, are tough to identify.

If the FBI is successful in tracking down the origins of the threatening note that was mailed to Fox just weeks before, that may go a long way.

And there is always a chance that, when the investigation appears to die down, one of the assailants will brag to the wrong person about the attack.

In the mean time, we all need to remain patient and to wish Jussie the best.

TMZ notes that Jussie continues to reside at his Chicago apartment, where he was living when the attack took place.

We hope that he remains safe."

Smollett was allegedly attacked while walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in downtown Chicago. Smollett says that two men approached him, targeted him with both racial and homophobic slurs, tossed a rope around his neck, and then poured an unspecified liquid on him, which may have been bleach. Smollett reported being injured in the attack, and later told law enforcement officials that the two attackers yelled “Welcome to MAGA country!” during the incident.

A subsequent investigation by Chicago police revealed that, indeed, Smollett did walk several blocks to and from a Subway sandwich shop that evening, but that Smollett was on camera for all but about 60 seconds of his trip, during which Smollett reports the attack took place.

Although two individuals were pictured on security cameras near where Smollett says he was attacked, sources close to CPD told local media that those two individuals appear to be homeless and were in the vicinity between 15 and 30 minutes before Smollett arrived back at his apartment on East Water Street, just north of the Chicago River. Chicago Police also reportedly dismissed a neighbor’s claim that a “redneck”-looking man was loitering behind Smollett’s apartment building, according to Chicago crime watch blog, CWB Chicago.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that Smollett was “reticent” to file a police report, but that another individual, present in Smollett’s apartment, encouraged him to call police and to seek medical attention. Smollett also refused to provide police with his phone, despite telling law enforcement that he had been on a call with his manager at the time of the attack.

The developments have led some to question Smollett’s version of the attack, even though the “Empire” star insists that his original version of events is the correct one, according to the Associated Press.

Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel reported Tuesday that he spoke to Police Superintendent Johnson and that Johnson told him Smollett is “still being treated as a victim” in his case, but that the police are pursuing all angles of the event.

#ChicagoPolice Supt Eddie Johnson says #JussieSmollett is still being treated as the victim in this case but if the investigation does reveal he made a false report he will be held accountable. — Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) February 5, 2019

Sources close to the Chicago Police Department also tell The Daily Wire that police have filed a series of subpoenas in order to compel the production of Smollett’s phone records from the night of the attack, a report apparently confirmed by CWB Chicago.

Police are also looking into the source of the rope Smollett says was placed around his neck during the attack. Initially, Smollett said the rope resembled a “noose,” but upon closer examination, according to the Sun-Times, the rope appeared to be a thin “clothesline” which police believe came straight out of the package before it ended up around Smollett’s neck (Smollett was still wearing the rope when police arrived to take his report, 45 minutes after the attack).

Investigators are reportedly “visiting retail stores” looking for surveillance camera footage of anyone buying a similar product in the days before the attack.

Fox News reporter Matt Finn also says that CPD is getting its “ducks in a row” for “possible interrogations” regarding the attack, but Finn did not provide details as to who or what might be interrogated.

Enter the latest blackface scandal involving politicians in Virginia.

The state’s attorney general, Mark R. Herring, who is second in line to succeed current governor Ralph Northam who’s embroiled in his own blackface yearbook scandal, admitted today that he dressed like rapper Kurtis Blow with a wig and blackface while in college.

—Stacey Abrams calls Trump’s government shutdown a “disgrace” in SOTU response—

Herring released this statement in response to the controversial confession, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports.

“The very bright light that is shining on Virginia right now is sparking a painful but, I think we all hope, important conversation. The stakes are high, and our spirits are low.

“I am sure we all have done things at one time or another in our lives that show poor judgment, and worse yet, have caused some level of pain to others. I have a glaring example from my past that I have thought about with deep regret in the many years since, and certainly each time I took a step forward in public service, realizing that my goals and this memory could someday collide and cause pain for people I care about, those who stood with me in the many years since, or those who I hoped to serve while in office.

“In 1980, when I was a 19-year-old undergraduate in college, some friends suggested we attend a party dressed like rappers we listened to at the time, like Kurtis Blow, and perform a song. It sounds ridiculous even now writing it. But because of our ignorance and glib attitudes – and because we did not have an appreciation for the experiences and perspectives of others – we dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup.

“This was a onetime occurrence and I accept full responsibility for my conduct.

“That conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others. It was really a minimization of both people of color, and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.

“Although the shame of that moment has haunted me for decades, and though my disclosure of it now pains me immensely, what I am feeling in no way compares to the betrayal, the shock, and the deep pain that Virginians of color may be feeling. Where they have deserved to feel heard, respected, understood, and honestly represented, I fear my actions have contributed to them being forced to revisit and feel a historical pain that has never been allowed to become history.

—Jussie Smollett is back on set filming ‘Empire’ after violent attack along with trauma counselors—

“This conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.

“As a senator and as attorney general, I have felt an obligation to not just acknowledge but work affirmatively to address the racial inequities and systemic racism that we know exist in our criminal justice system, in our election processes, and in other institutions of power. I have long supported efforts to empower communities of color by fighting for access to healthcare, making it easier and simpler to vote, and twice defended the historic re-enfranchisement of former felons before the Supreme Court of Virginia. I have launched efforts to make our criminal justice system more just, fair, and equal by addressing implicit bias in law enforcement, establishing Virginia’s first-ever program to improve re-entry programs in local jails, and pushing efforts to reform the use of cash bail. And I have tried to combat the rise in hate crimes and white supremacist violence that is plaguing our Commonwealth and our country.

“That I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt. Forgiveness in instances like these is a complicated process, one that necessarily cannot and should not be decided by anyone but those directly affected by the transgressor, should forgiveness be possible or appropriate at all. In the days ahead, honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general, but no matter where we go from here, I will say that from the bottom of my heart, I am deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation.”

Herring’s confession seemed to have come out of nowhere, but it was just a matter of time before Herring’s racist costume fiasco surfaced.

As for Northam, he is still resisting calls for his resignation from his own party after a bizarre weekend in which he first admitted he was in the picture where one man wore Blackface and another wore KKK garb, and then he denied it was him.

And Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, who many in the party were pushing to replace Northam, is also facing some tough questions after the same conservative web site that outed his boss published material accusing him of sexual assault. Fairfax strongly denied the allegations Monday.

According to USA Today sources, the woman accusing Fairfax has retained Washington law firm Katz Marshall & Banks. Once of the firm’s founding partners, Debra Katz, represented Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting when they were teenagers. He denied the allegation and was eventually confirmed to the court.

Just throw the whole administration away."

WARNING: This story contains explicit language.

Empire actor Jussie Smollett was initially hesitant to report an attack he allegedly suffered last Tuesday by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and put a rope around his neck.

According to a recently released police report, the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but that another person convinced him to do so.

The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with the actor when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name Empire as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

According to CNN, Smollett told police that “as he was walking to his residence, two unknown males approached him and gained his attention by saying verbatim ‘Empire fa***t n***er.'”

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

“The primary aggressor was wearing a black mask concealing any facial features and both offenders were dressed in black,” according to the report. “The victim does not remember any other distinguishing features of the offenders, or in which direction they fled,” it added.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday.

Guglielmi said that police are also going to stores to ask employees if they remember selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows anyone buying the kind of rope that was tied around the Beautiful singer’s neck.

“We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,” Guglielmi said.

The actor took police officers to the spot where he was allegedly attacked and told investigators he had received hate mail a week prior to the attack.

Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where Empire is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don’t yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

“Detectives continue to follow-up on investigative leads as additional security cameras have been located and footage is being downloaded and reviewed,” Guglielmi said. “The people of interest have not been identified (as homeless or otherwise).”

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations levelled on social media that he has been less than co-operative and changed his story.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett said in an exclusive statement to Essence. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger.”

“More importantly I want to say thank you,” Smollett’s statement continued. “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.”

His family said that the attack on the Empire actor in downtown Chicago this week was a “hate crime” and they pushed back against any suggestion that he was anything but honest with the police.

“Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice,” the family said.

Jussie Smollett is back on the Empire set, having shot scenes and even participated in table reads for the popular Fox show following the brutal racist and homophobic attack he endured last week.

According to TMZ sources, the actor has been on set this week with the cast and crew with full security in tow.

Smollett was grabbing a quick bite from a local Subway last week when he was attacked by two men wearing “Make America Great Again” hats at around 2 a.m. According to the Chicago Police Department, the thugs beat him, poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him, and tied a noose around his neck while calling him racist and homophobic slurs.

New details from the Chicago Police Department’s incident report revealed that responding officers found Smollett at his home with stained clothing and “white rope draped around” his neck, ABC News reports.

Smollet told police that two attackers caught his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs and began to beat him “about the face with their hands,” the report said.

They used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault. Smollett was not able to identify them, though he was able to share some key details about the height and weight of one the attackers.

TMZ reports that the police want to speak with Smollett again while he’s in town as part of their ongoing investigation.

The Empire star performed to a sold-out show at Los Angeles’ Troubadour on Saturday, using the opportunity to share a message of resilience with his fans.

“I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to, and I’m going to stand strong with you all,” he told the crowd.

Smollett exclusively told ESSENCE last week that he’s recovering, but that he’s thankful for the mass outpouring of support he’s received over the last few days.

“Let me start by saying that I’m OK,” Smollett began in his statement to ESSENCE. “My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words. “"

Sutherland faces charges of suspicion of sexual assault and vulnerable adult abuse for the assault of the 29-year-old woman who had been a patient at the facility for the last 10 years.

The nonverbal woman has ‘”no capacity to resist or even cry out,” he lawyer said. Workers at the facility became aware she was giving birth when she started moaning. Since the sexual assault, the Hacienda HealthCare facility “increased security measures to ensure the safety of all our patients.”

The Phoenix Police Department immediately started investigating the case and ordered DNA samples of employees who possibly had access to care for the woman.

Sutherland was a licensed practical nurse and had worked at the facility since 2011. He provided care to the unnamed woman around the time she became pregnant, police said. He was fired after being found that he was a match and arrested.

Hacienda’s CEO, Bill Timmons, stepped down Jan. 7. A doctor also resigned in the wake of the sexual assault revelation and another was suspended.

Sutherland is reportedly due back in court March 19."

Smollett then paused and stated: 'I'm the gay Tupac.'

Back in action: Jussie Smollett spoke out about his attack on Sunday while performing for fans in Los Angeles (above)

The 36-year-old actor is now back at work on Empire, and was seen in a video posted by a crew member on Tuesday.

It has been a busy few days on set as the cast and crew is wrapping up production on the fifth season of the Fox series after Smollett missed work last week in the aftermath of the attack.

The show has also been working around the absence of star Taraji P Henson these past few days, who is currently in New York promoting her new film What Women Want.

Cast members have now been given security details to ensure no one else is targeted while working on the show.

The incident report from the attack was released on Tuesday, and raises some questions about comments made by the police early in the investigation.

In the wake of the attack, the Chicago Police Department opened Smollett up to criticism by electing to publicly announce less than 12 hours into the investigation that detectives had reviewed 'hundreds of hours' of security footage and not found any evidence of an attack.

Th night of: Smollett posted on Instagram after arriving in Chicago around midnight, complaining about the cold weather

The report however shows that only four cameras were initially identified as being near the area where the attack took place.

One of those cameras was located in a parking garage and the other attached to a building across the street, which is five-lanes wide.

Those were also both north of the route that Smollett took home from the Subway.

The same goes for the two other cameras, which are used for traffic purposes and were not particularly close to where Smollett was attacked by the men.

It was then made public that after an expanded search that detectives still could not find footage, yet in the end the image of the two persons of interest came from a camera located less than a block from the scene that was in fact closer than the other four cameras noted in the report.

It was also on the route that Smollett took to return to his apartment.

Scene: 'I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately ... but I was not hospitalized,' said Smollett (map with inset of the scene where the attack occurred just outside Smollett's apartment)

Persons of interest: The two men who were seen walking across the street from Smollett (above) just before the attack

Smollett has never wavered from his timeline, and prior to the attack had been documenting his much-delayed flight back to Chicago from New York.

He posted on Instagram as soon as he landed, just after a midnight, but it is unclear if he had his luggage with him when he was attacked or had returned to his apartment first before going to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway.

Smollett was then just across the street from his residence when the attack occurred, and appeared to be heading into a back entrance of the building that was closer due to the weather.

The attack happened in a below ground street that runs by the building where Smollett lives, and video did show him entering with a noose shortly after 2am on Tuesday.

The proximity to his apartment would also explain why Smollett was so quick to get inside from the cold after spending close to 10 hours in transit that day.

Smollett told Chicago police that his attackers seemed to know who he was before they beat him and tied a rope around his neck.

He also reported that the two men were dressed in black and wearing black masks, and another eresidence at the apoaportment building recalled seieng men who fit that description earlier that night.

The men shouted a Smollett 'Empire f****t n****r' before attacking him in the street.

Smollett is black and openly gay.

He also revealed that he had been sent 'hate mail' at his work one week prior.

The report also revealed Smollett did not want to report attack, but another person believed to be Jackson went ahead and called police.

There is no mention of Smollett having been to Subway or that the men made any 'MAGA' comments in the incident report.

Police have said they would like to speak with Smollett again, who has been labeled a liar by a number of people in the wake of the attack.

At the same time, Liam Neeson has been making the press rounds after revealing he had an urge to commit a hate crime against a black person in response to learning that a female friend had been raped by a black man.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has done little to help the situation, choosing to comment by stating that Smollett's 'alleged statement of what happened' is 'horrific.'

Police meanwhile have confirmed that Smollett is scene walking across the street from the men in the video, disappears for minute, and then reappears with a noose around his neck."

It features this passage:

The Super Bowl should be pure, or as pure as any comically overblown brand extension devise can ever be. This is not a time to squabble over our differences. It should be a time to get together, eat a whole bucket of chicken, and punch your best friend in the stomach – like God intended.

So you know we’re off to a highly authentic, nuanced start, the Internet equivalent of Alistair Cooke’s Letters from America BBC radio series. As Lileks replies:

Okay, let’s look at some more . . . Trump Trump Trump and so on. Kapernick, whose kneeling showed that “America has a persistent problem with racial inequality that we seem to have no interest in reckoning with.” Nope, no discussion on that issue. You’d think it would come up in elections and political discussions, but it’s just not a big thing. Odd. Despite the cavalcade of horrific news stories about the rise of white supremacy in the US that bolstered Kaepernick’s thesis – from Charlottesville to the latest tragedy involving Empire star Jussie Smollett – We’ll just leave that one there, and skip ahead a bit. The build-up to this year’s Super Bowl has been mercifully free of political squabbling and self-righteous posturing. As much as I’d like this to be a sign that we too can move past the last three years of perpetual in-fighting, this detente is guaranteed to be short-lived. Surely, another front will open up in this rhetorical pillow fight. Maybe halftime show performers Maroon 5 will unfurl a Palestinian flag during their set. Could Patriots quarterback Tom Brady remove his jersey to reveal a “Build the Wall” t-shirt? What if the Los Angeles Rams win the game and refuse to visit the White House, then donate their championship bonus to Kamala Harris? Dave Schilling is a writer and humorist

I’m hardly the “stick to sports” guy conservative Americans are so fond of lashing out at, Wait a minute. Hold on. Conservatives lash out at the guys who want sports to stick to sports? but I also would like to enjoy my Bud Light commercials in peace. And what prevents you from doing so?

Certainly nothing this year, as Anheuser-Busch’s latest round of Super Bowl ads were consistently designed to please elite American leftists and cop Clio awards from the advertising industry (but I repeat myself). This year the ads featured ill-conceived freakouts over corn syrup, a Leonard Nimoy-esque search for both Bob Dylan and wind turbines, and, plugging Anheuser-Busch-imported Stella Artois, an ad that co-starred that legendary blue collar lager lass, Sarah Jessica Parker.

Exit quote:

The one thing right-wing bloviators are correct about is that sport is meant to be an escape. I’ve grown tired of mixing my personal ideological convictions with the simple, binary pleasures of watching two teams compete in an athletic contest.

Police have yet to apprehend two unidentified men suspected of assaulting actor Jussie Smollett, but they have located more surveillance footage relevant to the case.

The 35-year-old “Empire” star was allegedly attacked by two men as he was leaving a Subway restaurant in Chicago at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. The men allegedly started off their attack by shouting racist and homophobic slurs at Smollet, before beating him, throwing an unknown chemical on him, and leaving a noose around his neck.

Days after the attack, police released surveillance footage of two men considered persons of interest in the case. Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago Police Department, said in an update on Monday that police have since located more surveillance footage, but they are still calling for the public’s help.

“Detectives continue to follow up on investigative leads as additional security cameras have been located and footage is being downloaded and reviewed,” his statement reads. “The people of interest have not been identified (as homeless or otherwise).”

A portion of the newly discovered footage shows Smollett entering his apartment building with the noose still around his neck, an unnamed police official told CBS Chicago.

New details concerning the alleged assault were also released to the public this week. An early incident report states that Smollett did not initially want to report the alleged attack to police, ABC News reports. It was a friend of his who called police on his behalf, and officers arrived at the actor’s home to find him in stained clothes and a “white rope draped around” his neck, according to the outlet.

Smollett reportedly told police that the men who allegedly assaulted him yelled, “This is MAGA country,” as they left, according to earlier reports. He went to the doctor directly following the attack to treat his injuries, which included bruised ribs, Smollett said during his first post-assault performance on Saturday. Despite his injuries, he said that doctors have cleared him to continue performing.

“I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherf---ers win,” he said, according to Variety. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.”

The popular series that followed the personal and professional shenanigans of Gabrielle Union‘s character Mary Jane Paul ended with a marriage proposal from news producer Justin Talbot (Michael Ealy).

And now it looks like BMJ fans will finally get a wedding.

But is Mary Jane going to marry Justin? Or will one of her other former flames like married man Andre Daniels (Omari Hardwick) or her first love David Paulk (Stephen Bishop) try to put a ring on it?

In the clip that debuted last night during the premiere for BET’s new series American Soul and on social media, Mary Jane is standing in front of a mirror in a wedding dress and veil. Then her mom Helen (Margaret Avery) enters the room and says, “Pauletta it’s time.”

But the question remains: who is the boo that she’s marrying?

All eyes are on Mary Jane. Literally. Union herself even posted up some eye emojis in reference to the mysterious clip.

And her fans rejoiced.

As is the American custom, at the beginning of each calendar year the president addresses a joint session of Congress along with the U.S. Supreme Court and his cabinet. Blasted into television sets around the country (and the world), his annual “State of the Union” speech is meant to offer insight into national priorities and propose legislative agenda. (Last night’s official “State of the Union” address by Trump had actually been postponed after its originally planned date, Jan. 29, occurred during the government’s partial shutdown.)

But unlike Trump, Billy Porter’s “State of the LGBTQ Union” speech took the opportunity to address issues facing the queer community in particular — both the triumphs and the setbacks of 2018, and a look at what’s ahead for 2019, a year that marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots.

“While our rights are under threat and the sanctity of identities is in peril, let me be clear: the state of our union is strong,” Porter says.

But the “State of the LGBTQ Union” is not all metaphorical rainbows. Last year, in 2018 alone, 29 trans individuals lost their lives to violence, and anti-LGBTQ violence rose from previous years’ numbers. “And as the attack on our brother Jussie Smollett shows, violence can touch our lives no matter who knows your name,” Porter says.

Billy Porter also mentions our queer brothers and sisters in Chechnya, and our fellow community members in Brazil, where the nation has elected one of the most virulently anti-LGBT politicians to its highest office. And then there’s the trans military ban the Trump administration is attempting to enact.

But Porter insists the way to combat all of this is through love: “Love is strength — strength we must have to fight for our integrity and for our very lives. We will fight hate with solidarity by standing for our siblings around the world.”

“And If the victories of the last year prove anything,” he says, “we ain’t going no damn where.”

Donald Trump didn’t mention LGBT+ people once in his 2019 State of the Union address, so Pose star Billy Porter decided to do it himself.

The gay actor recorded his own State of the Union speech about equality, releasing it via queer TV network Logo before Trump addressed Congress on Tuesday (February 5).

Billy Porter: Trump administration ‘seeking to erase our very existence’

In the powerful eight-minute speech, Porter reflected on the issues that LGBT+ people still face across the US, from discrimination and hate crimes to a spate of anti-transgender violence, to the regressive policies of the Trump administration.

Porter said: “We are living with an administration that is seeking to erase our very existence. But we won’t let them.

“We must loudly and proudly declare, we are here, through the banning of transgender service members. We are here through the violence enacted by hate speech. We are here and if the victories of the last year prove anything, we ain’t going no damn where.

“We’re coming for that White House, and we’re gonna paint it rainbow!” — Billy Porter

“In November of this past year, America elected the most diverse Congress in history, with a record number of LGBTQ candidates seeking and winning office.

“Jared Polis of Colorado became the first openly gay man elected governor in these United States, and you better believe, we’re coming for that White House, and we’re gonna paint it rainbow!”

The Pose actor referenced Pete Buttigieg, who “has become the first ever openly gay, Democratic presidential candidate, joining a strong crop of Democrats ready, willing, and able to throw down with 45.”

Porter added: “While our rights are under threat, and the sanctity of identities is in peril, let me be clear: the state of our union is strong.”

Quoting Dr Martin Luther King Jr, he said: “Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that. As LGBTQ people, we face hate every day, due to the simple fact of our existence.

“The Human Rights Campaign reported that in 2018, no fewer than 29 transgender souls, mostly trans women of colour, lost their light to violence. We will try to do right by them, to say their names, so that their deaths may not be in vain.”

Billy Porter: We must stand up to hate crimes in the US and around the world

Porter cited statistics that show “the severity of hate violence against LGBTQ people is increasing,” adding: “As the attack on our brother, Jussie Smollett shows, violence can touch our lives, no matter who knows your name.”

Porter continued: “How do we fight this hate? With love. We must continue to demonstrate our love for each other. Love is strength, strength we must have to fight for our integrity and for our very lives.

“We will fight hate with solidarity by standing up for our siblings around the world. We stand with our siblings in Chechnya, where a crackdown on the LGBT community has resulted in 40 people being detained in recent months and at least two being killed.

“We will stand with our siblings in Brazil, where a rash of anti-queer violence has been compounded by the presidential election of a far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has a history of homophobic, racist and sexist comments, and who is enacting policies that leave LGBTQ Brazilians fearing for their rights, their freedom and their safety.

“We will fight hate by sharing their stories so the world may never turn a blind eye to injustice.”

Porter also referenced the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion, in June 2019.

He added: “We will continue to carry on the legacies of our elders, of Marsha P. and Sylvia, of Baldwin and Bayard, of Harvey, Larry, and Miss Major, we will continue to come together, to acknowledge and embrace our intersectional community, and to push for equality and justice for all.

“Though darkness may seem to overshadow the progress we’ve made, we must not let it snuff our light out. Love will and love must keep us united.

“Only with the strength from love can we continue to forge ahead, make no mistake. Our best days are ahead of us. Onward, and upward.

“God bless our LGBTQ community and God bless the United States of America.”"

According to a production source who spoke to TMZ, Smollett, who plays Jamal Lyon on the popular FOX drama, returned to the Chicago set on Monday to film the final scenes for one of the remaining episodes of the series’ fifth season. He then completed a table read with the cast on Tuesday.

His return to the set was aided with an upped security presence, with it previously having been reported that the series held an “emotional” production meeting just after Smollett’s attack. The cast and crew were reportedly informed that Fox had increased security around filming locations, including the presence of armed guards.

Just prior to the attack, FOX Studios in Chicago had received a letter threatening Smollett’s life, reading “You will die black f—“ in letters cut from magazines.

Smollett returned to Chicago on Sunday following his performance at the famed West Hollywood venue the Troubadour on Saturday, where he gave a live performance and addressed his attack to the audience of more than 300.

“I'm not fully healed yet. But I'm going to (be), and I'm gonna stand strong with y'all,” he said. “I had to be here tonight, y'all, I couldn't let those (expletives)...win.”

“I don't even care to name any names,"" he continued. “The hateful rhetoric that gets passed around, it has to stop. But guess what, it stops with the people that believe in love.""

The show marked the actor’s first public appearance since the Tuesday, Jan. 29 attack, in which two men wearing masks approached him in the early morning hours yelling racist and homophobic slurs. The verbal attack quickly escalated to a physical one, with the men assaulting Smollett with their hands and pouring an unknown chemical substance over him before tying a rope around his neck.

The incident required Smollett to be hospitalized for lacerations to his face and neck.

Investigating the attack “as a possible hate crime,” the Chicago Police Department scoured nearby cameras for any surveillance footage that may have captured the attack or any possible suspects. Shortly after, they released images of potential persons of interest.

On Monday, authorities announced that they had found additional surveillance footage from the time leading up to and following the incident. The video, which has not been released, does not contain the attack nor any possible suspects, according to reports.

The Chicago Police Department is now hoping to speak to Smollett to gather more information on the case now that he is back in Chicago."

So far, it looks like many Democrats and other political observers are laughing off Trump’s warning as a desperate Hail Mary pass to avoid meeting his political doom.

MSNBC’s Steve Benen, for instance, observes that the president’s decision to attack investigations in his State of the Union shows that “Donald Trump is afraid of what investigations might produce.”

Republican strategist Rick Wilson, meanwhile, writes that Trump’s pleas to not investigate him are a sign of obvious desperation that demonstrate just how much he is worried about what the multiple probes swirling around him and his associates will turn up.

“Trump knows his legal peril grows by the day, and he’s struggling to pry it off him while there might still be time,” Wilson writes. “Robert Mueller wasn’t in the House chamber tonight, but Trump’s odd performance and shambolic affect tells you the president felt the special counsel’s presence.”

Similarly, Trump’s political opponents did not appear to be fazed by the president’s threats to veto their legislation unless they backed off investigating him.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) literally laughed off Trump’s warning during a CNN appearance on Wednesday.

“He’s scared — he’s got something to hide!” Schumer told CNN’s John Berman. “Because if he had nothing to hide, he’d just shrug his shoulders and let these investigations go forward.”

If Trump seriously hoped he could scare off investigators with threats during his big speech on Tuesday, the reaction so far indicates his plan is backfiring."

—Metro Atlanta Church could be added to list of hate groups over pastor’s call for death of gays—

“I’ve always been fascinated with Christine Beatty,” Kwame told Crimetown reporter John White from federal prison. “She had an electric personality that kind of drew people to her.”

Beatty also sat down and gave her side of events about her relationship with Kilpatrick.

“It wasn’t some random affair, you know, I was in love with him,” she said. “He loved me. Again, I never speak for him, I speak for me, but I know that he loved me. It’s not stupid.”

Kilpatrick spoke with the producer in a number of telephone interviews from prison to detail the disgraced mayor’s full story of his rise and fall from grace. He resigned from office after pleading guilty to perjury in 2008. He was later found guilty on 24 of 30 counts, including racketeering.

Kilpatrick is scheduled to be released from jail on Aug. 1, 2037. He is also ordered to pay millions back to the city of Detroit in restitution.

Former Mayor Seeks Trump Pardon

In a lengthy Facebook post last June, Kilpatrick laid out all the reasons why Donald Trump should commute his prison sentence.

Kilpatrick has been incarcerated for seven years total between his stints in county, state and federal prisons on various charges and now sits in a New Jersey prison. His Facebook post asking for clemency highlights his faith and what he has endured since being imprisoned.

Excerpt:

“I accepted Christ as my Lord, my Savior, and my Redeemer that day; June 9, 2014. And everything in my life changed! Not just in my life, but also in the lives of my parents, my siblings and my sons.



“Yes, I have been punished severely. I have been chained like a wild animal, shacked around my ankles, waist and wrist, with a black box to keep my hands at my side many times. I have spent more than 5-Months in Solitary Confinement at different periods in this journey because they wanted to do that to me. I have experienced ridicule, scorn, and disrespect from prison staff that you couldn’t imagine.

He says he’s been taking lots of courses (literally every course he could) and now teaches his own courses in public speaking, employability skills, and Bible study. He is also a worship leader for the prison’s church services. Basically he’s saying he’s a model prisoner and he’s even copping to his own bad behavior.

“Yes, I have made some very bad decisions in my life. Yes, I betrayed my wife and family because of my own lust and sin. Yes, I failed to deliver on the promises and opportunities that was given to me by the people of Detroit, Michigan. And yes, I have been severely punished for it.”

Ultimately he’s making the claim that Detroiters, his family, and even Jesus have forgiven him and Trump should too.

“My family has forgiven me. I have asked the people of the city of Detroit for forgiveness many times. And most Detroiters have forgiven me as well…

By God’s grace, I have received a pardon from Him, through Christ Jesus. I pray that I will receive the opportunity for Pardon/Clemency from the President of the United States as well.”

Trump recently commuted the sentence of a Black woman named Alice Marie Johnson who was serving a life-sentence for non-violent drug offenses. He has also granted clemency to his supporters Dinesh D’Souza, Joe Arpaio, and Scooter Libby."

Empire actor Jussie Smollett was attacked in a hate crime against him in Chicago last Tuesday, by two men wearing “Make America Great Again,” or MAGA, hats.

The two men called him racist and homophobic slurs after identifying him as the character Jamal Lyon from Empire. In the show, Lyon faces adversity within his community for being a gay musician. Smollett himself is an activist and member of the LGBTQ+ community.

His attackers poured chemical substances on him, put a noose around his neck and ultimately hospitalized him.

Because the attack is still being investigated, police are calling it a “potential” hate crime. But it would be hard to deny that this attack wasn’t a racially motivated or homophobic act, especially because of the slurs directed at Smollett before he was attacked.

The use of the noose in the attack too-closely reflects lynching symbolism. Historically, these were used to murder and intimidate black civil rights activists for hundreds of years.

The use of lynches seems like some torture tool from the past — a racist and bigoted past. But it’s clear that these intimidation tactics are still being used, and they are still sending the same violent messages.

Obviously because the attack is still being investigated, a verdict of the motivations cannot yet be determined. But to say that this attack was not a hate crime is to erase centuries of violence against black Americans and LGBTQ+ individuals.

This isn’t the only case of lynching symbolism in America recently. In 2018, two black men from Oklahoma were lynched by a white family. The was ultimately not deemed to be racially motivated by investigators, but it would be ineffectual to deny the role of the noose in the crime.

And this is not the only homophobic attack either, not by far. According to the FBI’s 2017 hate crime statistics, 1130 out of 7175 hate crimes were based around sexual orientation. This doesn’t account for the crimes that weren’t reported.

The point is, Jussie Smollett’s attack is not a one-off case. Being both a black man and an LGBTQ+ member, the chances of this attack being hatefully motivated are high.

In a statement that day he said, “These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

The same report that identified which hate crimes were sexual orientation-based also reported that hate crimes have increased by 17 per cent from the previous year.

If it’s possible to conclude that lynching symbolism is representative of centuries of racism and degradation against black populations, I would say it’s also possible to conclude that MAGA hats represent something much more sinister as well.

The role of the MAGA hats worn by Smollett’s attackers should not be downplayed.

The attackers allegedly yelled “This is MAGA country” while committing their assault — a reference to Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Trump himself has a history of condoning violence in his campaigns. In 2017, he was reported to have encouraged police to be violent with potential offenders, saying, “when you see these thugs … please don’t be too nice.” He has also promoted violence against those who protested his presidential campaign, saying he’d defend anyone who hurt his protesters in court.

The hate and discrimination that has been incited in recent years seems to have made once-hidden racists and bigots much bolder in their actions. The guise of “making America great” has been cultivating racism.

It’s not just a matter of “opinion” or “picking sides.” Claiming allegiance with MAGA has become synonymous with violence, intimidation and oppression.

It goes without saying that no one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or their skin colour. Smollett has not yet fully healed, but this past Sunday he was set to perform at his first show since the attack.

In a statement that day he said, “These types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident.”

He went on to say that hate can only be stopped “with the people that believe in love.” He told the crowd that now is the time to be “blacker and gayer.”

Smollett’s belief that, in order to stop evil and violence, allies and minority individuals must work together to further prevent hatred from festering is, in my opinion, the most viable solution.

What better way to combat hate and destruction than by standing tall and persevering despite all odds."

Jussie Smollett has gone back to work on the set of 'Empire', a week after he was hospitalized following a brutal attack that police are investigating as a racist and homophobic hate crime.

A production source on the Fox drama series told TMZ that Smollett returned to Chicago on Sunday following his weekend show in Los Angeles, where he told fans he 'had to be here tonight' and 'couldn't let those [expletive] win'.

With security present the whole time, Smollett reportedly joined cast members shooting scenes for one of the final episodes of the season on Monday and completed a read-through on Tuesday.

Detectives investigating the case are keen to speak to the 35-year-old actor again now that he is back in town, according to TMZ.

The attack took place on January 29 at around 2am, soon after Smollett had left a Subway restaurant and was heading back towards his apartment. He is believed to be staying in the same complex while he is in Chicago.

On Monday, authorities said they have found further surveillance footage from the the time leading up to and after the incident, in which the actor was brutally beaten and a noose was put around his neck.

Police have not released the video and TMZ reports that it contains neither attack itself nor the assailants fleeing the scene.

The incident has shocked America for its allegedly racist and homophobic motives.

Smollett told police the two male attackers got his attention by calling him 'Empire f****t n*****' then battered him 'about the face' and 'poured an unknown chemical substance on him.'

One of the men, described as a 'primary aggressor' was wearing a black mask, he told them.

Smollett's manager, Brandon Z. Moore, previously said that he was on the phone to him when the incident happened and that he heard the attackers shouting 'This is MAGA country!'.

These are of two people of interest who were in area at the time of the attack but police have not been able to identify them or even determine if they are homeless

The attacks are believed to be premeditated as Smollett received a cut out letter, that appears to be dated from January 18, containing a racist and homophobic threat. Fox Studio received the letter on the 22nd and cops said it was laced with powder Tylenol

The photos show two men walking on North New Street (depicted above) near East Illinois Street around 1.45am on Tuesday. Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached him

President Trump condemned the attack last week, saying: 'That I can tell you is horrible. I've seen it ... last night. It doesn't get worse, as far as I'm concerned.'

A police incident report confirmed that Smollett had also told authorities he received homophobic hate mail in the week prior to the alleged hate crime.

It was sent to the studio where he films Empire and is said to have terrified staff.

Although he played the sold-out show at the famous Troubador in Los Angeles over the weekend, Smollett cancelled a follow-up a meet-and-greet session because of the incident."

Actor Jussie Smollett was initially reluctant to report that he had been racially attacked by two men last month in Chicago, according to a police report.

Smollett, the 36-year-old musician and actor who appears on the show Empire, told the police that he was accosted on the street at 2 am on January 29.

TV station ABC7 obtained a partially redacted copy of the report through a Freedom of Information Request on Monday. According to the report, the officers were told that Smollett “did not want to report the offence, however, he believed it to be in the best interest to”.

The report states that police found Smollett with a white rope around his neck, and that he stated the attackers threw an unknown chemical substance on him, staining his clothes.

Smollett said he was accosted by two men dressed in black, one of whom was wearing a ski mask. He did not remember any other details of the suspects.

Chicago Police have reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage in an effort to find the attackers, but have not found video of the attack. The department released an image of two ‘persons of interest’ in the case on January 30.

Smollett performed on February 2 at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, during which he sought to clarify some details of the incident.

“I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately… I was not hospitalised. And above all: I fought the f-back,” he said on stage."

CHICAGO – “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett told police that two men seemed to know who he was before they beat him, shouted racial and homophobic slurs, and looped a rope around his neck during an early-morning attack in Chicago, according to a recently released police report.

Smollett told police that two men dressed in black got his attention by mentioning the name of the TV show as he walked downtown early on Jan. 29. Smollett said the more aggressive man wore a black mask to conceal his face.

Smollett, who is black and openly gay, said the men then shouted slurs, beat him in the face with their hands and poured an unknown substance on him that stained his clothes. He said the men tied a rope around his neck before running away, according to a brief police report released to the public following a Freedom of Information request by media outlets.

The report noted that the 36-year-old actor said he initially didn’t want to report the attack, but that another person convinced him to do so. The name of the person who encouraged Smollet to call police was redacted in the report, which notes that the person was with Smollet when officers arrived at his Chicago apartment.

When officers arrived at his apartment, Smollett still had a white rope draped around his neck. The report also noted that officers turned off their body cameras at Smollett’s request, something that crime victims sometimes ask officers to do, according to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

No arrests have been made but police continue to collect and review surveillance video from the area and look for possible witnesses, Guglielmi said Tuesday. He said police are also going to stores to ask employees if they recall selling rope to anyone and to determine if security camera footage shows someone buying the kind of rope that was tied noose-like around Smollet’s neck.

“We are starting to search stores to see if any of this kind of rope was purchased in the area,” Guglielmi said.

Smollett went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being advised to do so by the officers, according to the police report. Police said he was treated for scrapes and bruises and released.

Smollett took officers to the spot where he was attacked and told investigators he’d received hate mail a week earlier. Police have said the FBI was investigating the letter, which was sent to the studio in Chicago where “Empire” is filmed.

Guglielmi said officers don’t yet have video showing the attack and are continuing to search for two men who were walking in the area at around the time of the attack to question them about what they may have seen.

Smollett and his family have defended themselves against allegations leveled on social media that he has been less than cooperative and changed his story. On Saturday, Smollett gave a concert at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, telling the audience that if he did not perform his attackers would win."

The Stand is one of Stephen King's most beloved novels, and one of the stories his fans have most wanted to see adapted for the screen. First released in 1978, it tells the story of an apocalyptic plague that kills nearly all of the human race, and leaves the survivors caught in a battle between the forces of good and evil. In 1994, The Stand was adapted for TV and broadcast on ABC. That version is not always remembered fondly among King aficionados, but its cast saw huge success in the years afterward. The series put stars like Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinise in starring roles. This time around, there is no telling who might take on King's classic tale. The show is being produced as a CBS All Access original, meaning it will be made just for the streaming service. In addition, it will get 10 episodes to tell its story this time rather than four. There have been a lot of Stephen King adaptations since the last attempt at The Stand, and the writer's work has a much bigger Hollywood appeal. With that in mind, here are some of the actors we at PopCulture.com would most like to see in the upcoming adaptation of The Stand.

Warning! Spoilers for The Stand lie ahead!

Stu Redman (Photo: Amazon Studios) The Stand is more or less led by white-hat-cowboy archetype Stu Redman. The character is reserved and decisive, and plays a pivotal role in the story's battle between good and evil. Last time around, Redman was played by Gary Sinise. This time, a good pick could be John Krasinski. Krasinksi has proven his ability to adapt to the role he is given, and audiences already love him as both a comedian and a dramatic actor. The role of Stu will involve a lot of posturing and stare-downs, and Krasinksi has the best dead-pan resume in all of Hollywood. Elsewhere, on fan sites and blogs, many are floating names like Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Gosling for the role of Stu Redman. These choices make sense, as the actors have a history of completely transforming for their characters.

Frannie Goldsmith (Photo: Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto via Getty Images) Frannie Goldsmith is going to be a complicated character to cast, especially in 2019. Last time around, she was played by Molly Ringwald, leaving no doubt that she was the leading lady of the story. Still, in King's book, Frannie is college age, while Stu — her eventual love interest — is portrayed as older, likely in his mid-30s. This will pose a problem for audiences who are tired of seeing these massive age gaps perpetuated on screen. The problem will likely lead to the studio casting a young, largely unknown actress. However, many fans are hoping a recognizable actress like Elizabeth Olsen will take on the role. Olsen could be a good choice to bring some independence to the role of Frannie. She would help portray the subtler parts of Frannie's thinking that are more difficult to translate to the screen. Other popular choices among fans are Shailene Woodley, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Alison Brie.

Larry Underwood (Photo: Getty Images) Larry Underwood is one of the characters that presents the most possibilities for casting The Stand. The disgruntled rock star was played by Adam Storke in the 1994 version, and while he is meant to be on the young side, he could be played by a wide range of ages, ethnicities and appearances. With that in mind, why not consider an actor on everyone's mind for the role: Jussie Smollett. The Empire star has a proven track record playing a musician on-screen, and he has the voice to back it up. Smollett could play a contemplative version of Larry Underwood, capturing the confusion and alienation of the character in a new way. Other popular picks for Larry are Charlie Cox, who played Daredevil in Marvel's Netflix series, and Bill Skarsgard. Skarsgard is an easy pick as well, and he has already proven successful in two recent Stephen King adaptations — It and Castle Rock.

Glen Bateman (Photo: Earl Gibson III/WireImage) Glen Bateman is one of those background characters that is integral to the story. He serves a vital purpose as a friend, mentor and springboard to the world's rising leaders in The Stand. In 1994 he was played by Ray Walston, but there are plenty of faces that could play the 57-year-old sociology professor. Our first big proposal for Bateman is Jim Rash. The actor has the kind of limitless affability needed to play the chatty professor, and he has has collegiate mannerisms well practiced from his years on Community. On the other hand, an interesting choice for Bateman could be comedian Dave Chappelle. Again, there are no restrictions on race or ethnicity for Bateman. In his most recent stand-up specials, Chappelle talked a lot about his life outside of Hollywood living in Ohio, and those experiences could translate nicely to Bateman's native New Hampshire. Chappelle also brings the conversational wisdom that Bateman is famous for to the table.

Nick Andros Whoever takes on the role of Nick Andros has big shoes to fill, a they will replace Rob Lowe, who played the character in 1994. Andros is a poor transient worker who is deaf and mute, yet clever enough to navigate most situations. His instincts come in handy after the apocalypse, and he becomes something of a heroic figure in the Boulder Free Zone. Why not cast a young heroic type that is already popular with TV viewers and cast Cole Sprouse? Sprouse has the kind of ease and charm that Andros projects in the story, and he is just the right age for the character. It doesn't hurt that Sprouse also has a built-in audience of dedicated fans who have a proven love for unravelling mysteries, of which The Stand will present many. Another strong contender here is Dane DeHaan. The actor is a few years older than Nick Andros, though he has the features and comportion to play a young drifter. DeHaan has delivered some stunningly emotional performances with few words, and he could likely do the same if he were cast as The Stand's silent hero.

Tom Cullen (Photo: Netflix) Likely the trickiest character to cast will be Tom Cullen. Cullen is a mentally handicapped man with no support system, who joins up with Nick early on. He was played by Bill Fagerbakke in 1994, and may represent another of King's characters that simply does not age well. Still, there is a way to bring fresh relevance to a character like Tom Cullen, and there are actors who could do it. One clear choice might be Adam Devine. The comedian has a kind of self-effacing earnesty that would serve the character well. There is no doubt that Cullen has to be energetic, and who is better at that than Devine? Fans have had a hard time coming to a consensus on ideal actors for Cullen, not least of all because his age is not very clear. Popular options range from John C. Reilly to Andy Samberg, and everyone in between.

Ralph Brentner (Photo: Theo Wargo/Getty Images) Another side character with a lot to contribute is Ralph Brentner. The easy-going army veteran picks up Nick Andros and Tom Cullen, carting them to Boulder in his old pick-up truck. He was played by Peter van Norden in 1994. A lofty option for Brentner is John Goodman. The actor is perfect for the blue-collar archetype with sage wisdom and quick wit. While it may seem like a stretch to get an actor like Goodman, it is worth noting that he returned to network TV last year for Roseanne, and then again for The Conners. Failing that, many fans envision a slightly younger, more battle-ready version of Brentner this time around. Names that have been suggested include Christopher Meloni and even Josh Brolin.

Harold Lauder (Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Critics' Choice Awards) Producers will have to take care in casting Harold Lauder, who becomes a central figure as The Stand goes on. The age of the actor becomes an issue again here, as it is important to the story that Harold and Frannie went to high school together, and both graduated within the last few years. The actors playing both of them should be with a few years of each other in age. In 1994, Harold was played by Corin Nemec. Alex Wolff is one interesting choice for Harold. The actor has a resume going all the way back to childhood with The Naked Brothers Band, though more recently he burst onto the scene in Hereditary. Wolff has the raw emotion needed for Harold Lauder, which might be especially important in an on-screen version without the character's point-of-view thoughts and narration. If age were a bit more flexible, another good choice for Lauder could be Alfie Allen. The actor has a history of playing similar characters, portraying both Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones and Iosef Tarasov in John Wick.

Mother Abigail (Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Finally, the last two characters are King's virtual demi-gods in The Stand, including 108-year-old Mother Abigail. The elderly African-American matriarch is a bit outdated, matching the stereotypical ""magical black mentor"" character that persists in many of King's stories. In the 1994 version, she was played by Ruby Dee. Accepting that 108-year-old actresses are few and far between, there are plenty of performers who could be artificially aged for the role. One frontrunner is Yvette Nicole Brown, who has the awareness and authenticity to navigate the character through all her tropes and issues to find the truth underneath. Other popular picks among fans online include Alfre Woodard, Thandie Newton and Oprah Winfrey."

Johnson’s comments mark the first time since the controversy erupted last week that a Chicago city official has suggested that the incident could in fact be a hoax.

Additionally, police are “getting their ducks in a row” for possible interrogations, according to Fox News‘ Matt Finn.

Smollett claims that his attackers made racial and anti-gay comments while using President Trump’s “MAGA” slogan during the 2 a.m. assault in frigid (-20 degree windchill) downtown Chicago. So far, no surveillance video has emerged showing the attack.

As PJ Media’s Patrick Poole reported last week, the ongoing investigation into the alleged hate crime has raised more questions than answers and the pictures of two shadowy “persons of interest” released by the Chicago Police only added to the controversy.

Chicago-based police blogs Second City Cop and CWB Chicago have reported that the useless pictures were only released to satisfy the city’s liberal top officials.

“Our contacts say that the ‘persons of interest’ happened to wander into a camera frame and seem to have had nothing to do with the event in question – but the bosses want to look like they’re doing something to appease [Mayor] Rahm [Emanuel] and the Hollywood money people,” Second City Cop reported on January 31.

“The two ‘potential persons of interest’ seen in surveillance images released by Chicago police last week ‘are two bums,'” a source who is familiar with the investigation told CWB Chicago. “Downtown demanded that we put out something, so we issued the photos,” the source said. “They weren’t happy.”

In another new development, another source close to the investigation told CWB that the purported threat letter against Smollett was mailed from Chicago’s southwest suburbs. The letter was sent about eight days before the alleged attack.

The envelope was addressed to Smollett at the Empire production offices in Chicago and had “MAGA” scrawled in the return address space. A white powder in the letter is believed to be Tylenol, according to other media reports. The investigation into the letter’s origins is being quietly conducted by the FBI.

Meanwhile, according to Second City Cop’s sources working on the case, Smollett has been “refusing all forms of cooperation,” and so is his manager Brandon Z. Moore, who claims he clearly heard racist slurs and “MAGA country” taunts over the phone.

The “persons of interest” are all but unidentifiable and left the area 20 minutes before the “attack,” not to mention the anonymous witness who saw a “hillbilly looking” character that not a single camera in a one mile radius has a picture of.

CWB reported that subpoenas for the phone records of Smollett and Moore have been issued. And police have “dismissed” the claims of the woman who reported seeing the “redneck” characters with rope in the area before the purported attack.

Investigators have also been working hard to identify the source of the rope that Smollett says was tied around his neck in a noose during the attack, CWB reports:

The FBI has extensive scientific resources and product samples that frequently allow its technicians to identify the manufacturer of rope and cord evidence. In a simplified example, technicians could determine that the rope is made by “ABC Rope Company.” Investigators might contact ABC and learn that the particular variety recovered from Smollett is sold as a plain-label product through Walgreens stores. Investigators then ask Walgreens for records of transactions in which the rope was sold. The last step would be to identify the more promising purchases and to review surveillance video and financial records of those transactions. A source close to the case said Monday that investigators were visiting retail stores, which may indicate that the search for video and transaction records is underway.

Over the weekend, Smollett seemed to be on the mend during his performance at an L.A. nightclub."
